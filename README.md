# Algorithms in Data Science Projects

In this repository, you will find the source codes and the experiments that my teammates and I accomplished for Algorithm in Data Science course at EPL, [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/fr/index.html). In this course, we were assigned 4 projects, which are as follow:

## Projects
- 1-Network Creation based on the characters of a novel. (Includes: Network Study, Network Analysis, and Information Diffusion) See report [here](https://github.com/nima-farnoodian/Alg.-in-Data-Scienece/blob/main/Project1-Anna%20Karenina/Anna%20Karenina-Network%20Study.pdf).

- 2-Biden's and Trump's fans tweets:  A classifier to predict in whose favor a tweet is posted. (Includes: Word and Document embedding) See report [here](https://github.com/nima-farnoodian/Alg.-in-Data-Scienece/blob/main/Project%202/Data_Science_Pr2%20(1).pdf).

- 3-Dataset Privacy Engineering. (Includes: Cellular Automata Cryptography, k-anonymity, and l-diversity). See report [here](https://github.com/nima-farnoodian/Alg.-in-Data-Scienece/blob/main/Project%203-%20Privacy-eng/Data_Science___Pr3.pdf).

- 4-Free topic: Transport for London (Grasping Londonâ€™s commuter journey by applying the journey information into a replica of Transport for London net.) See report [here](https://github.com/nima-farnoodian/Alg.-in-Data-Scienece/blob/main/Project%204-%20London%20Transportation/LINMA_2472___Proj_4.pdf).

Code, notebooks, and reports are all available in the relevant directories.
