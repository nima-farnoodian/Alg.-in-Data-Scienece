# Abstract

For our final project, we have opted for an urban question : Transportation. One of the most
cosmopolitan cities, London is known for its sophisticated and highly developed transport system. Undoubtedly,
it would be audacious of our part to point out problems or either make recommendations
consistent enough. We are aware that we picked an example of a complex social system that requires
deep insights.
However, we aim to grasp Londonâ€™s commuter journey by applying their journey information into
a replica of Transport for London net. We created a directed and weighted network based on the part
of the trips in November of 2009.
To exploit such a rich social study, we also implemented a current social theme in our network.
As travelling safely on the bus, train and subway are the primary concern during this unprecedented
period due to the current Covid-19 pandemic ; we opted for proposing a shortest-path recommendation
framework in terms of safety in the London transportation network with the hope of reducing contamination
risk for commuters. Indeed, we formalized and created a new term "safer shortest-path", which
is meant to provide the commuters with low-risk and relatively short travel routes.
