Our challenge is to find the best balance between data utility and anonymity. But first, we must recall
What is sensitive information? Most of us would be comfortable with our medical information disclosed.
But in many cases, what is sensitive to one might no be sensitive for others. Sensitive information has
a cultural component. In some countries, many people would not like to have their taxes information
available in extension to how much money they make. On the other hand, in Sweden, this information is
public. Similarly, the data utility requires a fine-tune alignment with the anonymous data set purposes.
What information are relevant for such works as building a hospital or studying the stress impact on people's
lives. More than only statistical knowledge, we discovered that Anonymity is a craft-work that demands
a holistic understanding. Good work should take to account cultural components, statistics as well as
technical aspects of the purposes to preserve data utility.
