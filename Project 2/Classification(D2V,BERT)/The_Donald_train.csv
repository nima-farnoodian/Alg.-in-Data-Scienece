See my personal copy/pasta:

Reddit is a state actor of China. They accepted $300 Million to fund the site and regularly suppress content critical of the Chinese Government and actively allow pro-communist and socialist propoganda and posts to flourish. 

https://fortune.com/2019/02/08/reddit-is-blocked-in-china-but-may-land-a-massive-investment-from-tencent/

Their lack of action to outright calls to violence from the Socialists and Communists on reddit and failure to equally enforce the rules/TOS are a breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the requirements of 47 U.S.C. ¬ß 230. 

Reddit is headquartered in San Francisco and thus must abide by US laws. It isn't in their Terms of Service or rules that they are acting as a Chinese State Actor, thus they are conducting fraud against US Citizens. 

This censorship of US citizens is a violation of their First Amendment rights and private company or not, they operate a social media company on US soil. In the 2017 US Supreme Court case, Packingham vs NC,¬† the Court stated that social media companies and cyberspace are the modern public square for discussing and disseminating ideas and this First Amendment protections apply.

Reddit acting as a state actor of China and censoring, banning, shadowbanning, or deleting US Citizens posts or quarantining communities is National Origin Discrimination pursuant to 42 USC ¬ß 2000a. US citizens and Patriot's have a right to free enterprise even on social media and it is a violation of US Federal Law to discriminate based on their National Origin, even Patriotic Americans whose pride and beliefs you may not share.

143,"&gt;I'm worried about the progeny of the 90% of people who don't really care enough to puzzle these things out deeply... Religion seems to be the only way to guarentee those values get transmitted from generation to generation.  


It is certainly a powerful tool as I've mentioned, but I don't think it is the only one. There are other things that have persisted in our culture outside of religion, for an example the idea of democracy or a republic is irreligious. It is simply an idea that everyone has exposed to constantly, so it is able to propagate  to people who are far separated from anyone who lived under a monarchy. I think that other ideals are passed on even when not critically examined by parents to their children. For example, everyone outside the church of social justice knows exactly what it means to be a man because they have had good men to observe. There has been an active effort to remove these ideals, but they have persisted for a long time on their own. If people have solid ideals, they don't all need to put much thought into those ideas for them to stick around.

I fully agree with your view on science. It is a tool for providing explanations, not a religion. It is amoral, and is often not relevant to moral questions. There are people who definitely put it too high on a pedestal, and it will never be able to answer questions in the realms of religion or philosophy. 

The reason I think that our scientific endeavors will reduce religiosity in our society is that it removes the etiological functions of religion. We don't need anything supernatural to satisfactorily explain anything from celestial mechanics to the emergence of life, so the argument that there has to be a higher power to explain nature is very weak at this point. 

I agree that Islam in particular is resisting this encroachment, though there are pockets of other religions that do as well. Christian creationism comes to mind; in their view if Genesis is not literally true there is no reason to believe anything that comes after it. Ideally Islam will go through a reformation like Christianity did, but it won't be any easier for them than it was for the early protestants. It's quite clever how closely they control information about the faith, such as by declaring that the Quran is only valid in Arabic, but I don't see it being any more impervious than medieval Christianity was. It will be a long time and many lives lost before Islam is dragged into modernity, but it will happen so long as there are outside influences on it. I could be wrong, but we have historical precedents in Christianity and Judaism for religious groups becoming compatible with modern values.


&gt;Most people are scared of freedom. They want an authority figure who knows what to do to reassure them they everything is ok. 


That certainly seems to be the case today. It may well be that the fall of our society to bigger and bigger states is inevitable. I don't think that religiosity can really prevent that, as even if you think God is the ultimate authority freedom is still a pain in the ass in the here and now. Freedom requires a great deal of personal responsibility and constant defense, and an irresponsible Christian will be just as likely to support government overreach as an irresponsible atheist. The thing to do here is to stop with the participation trophy BS and teach kids to actually work for what they want. Part of the reason I think so many young adults are scared of freedom because they have never learned responsibility; they've never been allowed to fail until the consequences of failure are terrifying. A person that has taken risks, failed, learned, and improved is much more likely to value freedom than someone who was coddled their whole life.


&gt;America is one nation, under god. The founders understood that and that god was fundamental to American greatness was without doubt in their minds.


That isn't entirely accurate. Most of the founding fathers were deists or deists who integrated some Christian tradition but didn't think that God was theistic. It is definitely part of our heritage, but it is pretty clear that the founding fathers wanted religion separate from the government for various reasons. ""One nation under God"" was a much later addition (it was added to the pledge in 1954). Before that addition, it was ""one nation indivisible"", or the older ""e pluribus unum"" (from many one). The original ethos as far as I can tell was not that America was ruled by God, but that the state was under the control of the people. 

There were certainly a shift fairly early on toward more religiosity, as your quote demonstrates, but as to the founding it seems from my reading that it was a secular endeavor. In any event, while I wouldn't be overly concerned about people becoming more religious within reason, I don't think it can happen in our society anymore. Belief is something you have to convince people of, and I don't see the arguments for actually believing in a God to be very compelling. Basically, even if I thought that re-converting to Christianity would make my life immeasurably better, the best I could do is pretend unless someone hits me with a substantially more compelling line of reasoning than I've encountered. I don't think that kind of disingenuous ""cultural christianity"" does anyone much good; if you don't actually believe it, it will not affect your beliefs on things like morals."

Judicial Watch article headline:

Judicial Watch Finds Millions of ‚ÄòExtra‚Äô Registrants on Voting Rolls ‚Äì Warns California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Colorado, Virginia to Clean Up Voting Rolls or Face a Federal Lawsuit

Sounds terrible.  MILLIONS of 'Extra' Registrants on voting rolls.

Nothing in the article indicates whether these are on the 'active voter roll' or 'inactive voter roll.'

Inactive voter rolls keep track of people that voted sometime in the past, but did not vote in the last election.

If we dig into the article we find this: (I bolded the links to other articles)

""California also¬†**settled**¬†a similar lawsuit with Judicial Watch that last year began the process of removing up to 1.5 million ‚Äúinactive‚Äù names from Los Angeles County voting rolls.¬†**Kentucky**¬†also began a cleanup of up to 250,00 names last year after it entered into a consent decree to end another Judicial Watch lawsuit.""

Lets look at California.  After you click through a couple article to article links, you find the following settlement document:

https://www.judicialwatch.org/documents/jw-v-logan-exhibit-a-settlement-08948/

A few notes.  The following are who will be removed from the ""inactive voter rolls"" (active voter rolls aren't touched):

""WHEREAS, Under Section 8(d), 52 U.S.C. ¬ß 20507(d), a registration is 
subject to removal from the official list of eligible voters on grounds of a change of 
residence if:
(a) The registrant fails to respond to a notice (a ‚ÄúSection 8(d)(2) 
Notice‚Äù) that includes a postage prepaid and preaddressed return 
card sent by forwardable mail, on which the registrant may state his 
or her current address, and which contains specific instructions and 
information consistent with the language set forth in 52 U.S.C. ¬ß 
20507(d)(2), and
(b) The registrant then fails to vote or appear to vote (or to correct the 
Registrar‚Äôs record) during the period ending on the day after the 
second federal general election subsequent to the Section 8(d)(2) 
notice being sent. 52 U.S.C. ¬ß 20507(d)(1)(B).
WHEREAS, Cal. Elec. Code ¬ß 2226(b) provides that ‚Äú[t]he voter 
registration of any voter whose name has been placed on the inactive file of 
registered voters for failure to respond to an address verification mailing required 
by Section 2225, and who does not offer to vote or vote at any election between the 
date of the mailing and two federal general elections after the date of that mailing, 
may be canceled.‚Äù Cal. Elec. Code ¬ß 2225 describes forwardable address-
confirmation notices that are to be sent to registered voters believed to have 
changed addresses.""

To boil this down.  If someone does not respond to a letter AND has not voted in the last two federal general elections OR has not appeared to vote (whatever that means) in the last two federal general elections, they are removed from ""inactive voter rolls.""

This has NO EFFECT on election fraud.  It has NO EFFECT on illegal immigrants voting.

Now keeping this in mind, look at how JW's press release reads:

""Judicial Watch Sues California and Los Angeles Over Dirty Voter Registration Rolls""

This is the epitome of Fake News and misleading your readers.

Now lets go back to the original article:

You'll find this statement from JW:

""An unusually high registration rate suggests that a jurisdiction is not removing voters who have died or who have moved elsewhere, as required by [federal law].""

So we are still talking about inactive voter rolls.  The registered voters that ARE NOT VOTING.  

Not the active voters that are illegal or fraudulent.

""Hey, these people that have not voted in 4 years: we'd like you to remove them.""  

JW is the equivalent of SPLC."

371,"Oh, did you miss his tweets when he was going after millionaires too? They were very evil and couldn‚Äôt have possibly earned the vast amount of wealth they accumulated ethically either. He was very assertive that millionaires weren‚Äôt paying their fair share. Suddenly he stopped mentioning millionaires...

434,"What are you waiting for?

Head over to TheDonald.win!"
435,One of the only posts that is not locked. Reddit is asshole!
436,Do the original mods have more power than the new imposter mods? How does it work? Can the new people take over and kick out all the real mods?
437,Thanks for the post OP.  Any update on how long you mods are going to keep posting restrictions in place?
438,"Got my 3rd warning, no fucking clue what for.
Wasn't here"
439,Finally some good content
440,Reddit admins have locked comments on *both* sticky posts. How long before they lock comments on *all* posts!?
441,"Change is good...
 #Click on over to Thedonald.win."
442,Wow I can actually see something new!
443,hey hi new post!
444,There are no new imposter mods yet.
445,We're moving to thedonald.win folks.  Spez has no power over us there!
446,"How many of the 750,000 users here decided that this would be today‚Äôs post?  At least during the quarantine I could come here to find out what the fuck happened in South Carolina."

453,Why are comments locked on the top 5 stickies?
454,"That sounds like what a new imposter mod would say... 

=)"
455,"Good. Cuck‚Äôs plan seems to have hit a snag. Maybe they didn‚Äôt expect all the media attention? Fuck them.

I can‚Äôt wait for Reddit to be classified as a publisher and I can sue the shit out of them for offending me."
456,"Dotwin is simply US preaching to US. 

I understand the rah rah aspect there. But people that like and already will be voting Trump are pretty much the only ones on there. 

And right now. As far as I can see. You can only post text or photos. Not news sources."

Depends on when their chinese wallets order them to further suppress Trump supporters"
469,"I still don't have my wrong-think warning badge. But I have been banned from multiple subs retroactively.  They think they're hurting us. They are simply making us stronger and seeking out alternatives. ""Echo chamber intensifies""

Reddit is ashoe!"
470,"Incorrect.  I have full perms as do the rest of the remaining mods.  We have plenty of power on the Dom, we just are keeping it slow enough to not need to accept any cucked plant mods."
471,"Someone take these commie fuckers that run Reddit to court, blatant election meddling happening right on our own soil. This is a disgrace, thank you for your work Tom and I‚Äôm sorry this post will be hijacked, every other post is being locked just hours after being posted!!

Give me 10 hours and a 5 person team and I can probably get you thousands of screenshots of left-leaning subs leaving up comments/posts that are hundreds of times worse than what Reddit admins say happens on TD.  Been browsing this sub for over a year now and can only remember a few examples of violent rhetoric being used, usually shut down within hours if not minutes. My only regret is i wasn‚Äôt here in 2015."
472,Maybe the top posts over at .win should make the grade then. Right now r/The_Donald has pretty much become a couple mods‚Äô personal Twitter feed.

476,The full mod team and the millions of pedes here weren‚Äôt able to stop the shills that planted the vIoLeNcE aGaInSt CoPs posts. Why blame the mods for spez fucking us over?
477,Hmmm upvotes have been hidden. Is that a thing?
478,Are we sure the T_D mods didn't lock the other threads?
479,"True.  I like the spice, just curious why this was the chosen one"

492,I was able to comment on this one post only.
493,"Fitton needs to fight for this domreddit. He's the only one posting content these last few days. We need courts to step in and save this community. It's not about being on reddit, it's about fighting for what's right."
494,"I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed by how you‚Äôre handling all this.

By restricting the subreddit and telling everyone to move over to .win, it legitimately feels like you‚Äôve done exactly what the admins have been wanting you to do: getting us all off their platform and onto somewhere else, without even putting up a fight.

Will the subreddit ever return from restricted, or is this just going to be it from now on? You guys all pushing people to the other platform while completely shutting down discussion here? If so, it‚Äôs a legitimately disappointing way for things to go down."
495,"Mine didn‚Äôt have links either, except to their policy."
496,They're going through my posts and comments and banning me for wrong-think from other subs from days and weeks ago. Fucking losers with nothing better to do. So desperate. Shows were getting to them.
497,MY question is how this doesn't disqualify reddit from their current platform not publisher status?
498,"Remember, so called ""radical right"" was center right just a few years ago. Just like 10 years ago being able to protect your border wasn't a hill people die on

It's just American politics are sprinting left, so what was normal is now called extreme just for shits and giggles"
499,"Yep. And I've emailed them, twice asking for what post broke policy, no reply, they don't care. Bitches"
500,Shadowban test. Let me know if this visible.
501,Can someone provide a link to the speech?
502,"Barr hinted that he might get around to it eventually. No urgency or timetable,  just a throwaway comment that means nothing, really."
503,"This is true but it has never been as blatant as it is right now. 

It‚Äôs one thing to quarantine a subreddit, it‚Äôs another to remove half its mods and lock every post 4 hours after it‚Äôs up."
504,REDDIT HATES YOU!

516,"Yes, The_Donald subreddit is still essentially down."
517,"Wait sorry maybe I‚Äôm ootl, why are old T_D mods locking the only recent threads up on the sub?

There are barely any new posts coming in so the ones on the front page is really our only place to chat, am I missing something?"
518,Yeah; .win doesn‚Äôt have the same vibe.
519,"That is entirely untrue, how dare you smear Spez like that!

Spez gets fucked *by* donkeys, while Winnie the Pooh watches and choke his tiny communist chicken."
520,Spez can go screw himself he can't keep locking all the threads
521,"First, thank you to whoever made thedonald.win happen. Fuck all those commie assholes here on reddit. 

Anyways, I ask for one wish. We need to make thedonald.win mobile friendly. We need to be able to see full screen memes instead of the small thumbnails that are currently presented on thedonald.win site. If that happens, we win and we can leave reddit in the dust."
522,"Yep, the salt in Nov is gonna be glorious"
523,Mods can allow any posts they choose to allow.
524,Don't have one?
525,There are claims posted that the mods turned posting off to block karma from  accruing to new users trying to take over as mods.
526,"Just like the meme, reddit is turning into a shithole country."
527,So we can leave comments on post? Or will this post get locked also
528,"I read it was the one about the transmission fluid and the one about the CIA spy in the White House.

This whole thing is freaking me out.  I was over on thedonald.win making a post about t_d posts being locked and flipping out about the canary being wrong, holy shit.

This mess is a disaster for *everyone's*  free speech and is criminal is more ways than one.

We could start with donations in kind Reddit is making to the Democrat party, for instance."
529,"Win isn‚Äôt capable of the same impact. I use mobile and win sucks on mobile. Takes 30+ seconds to open up a post to view and if I want to comment, takes forever and I have to prove I‚Äôm not a bot. I hope either win gets a mobile app up and running or the-donald gets back ti allowing the memes to flow."
530,X to doubt
531,Bingo!
532,I‚Äôm not leaving. Bake the cake spez.
533,Spez is a pedophile.  Expose him Tom.
534,"Not very WHAT of me? 

Fuck off. 

You wouldn't know an American flag if it fucked you up the ass. 

My posts above are calling you out for the shill you are. You clearly haven't been around here to see the bullshit censorship. And now you're calling to your cuck SPEZ god to save you. 

Again. Fuck off. We won't ever submit to you. This üëè isn't üëè gina üëè. 

You're clearly sitting there making statements on behalf of the cum guzzling piece of shit you are leasing thanks to. By saying what you've said you've confirmed you're a fuckwad, cuck fagotting fuck face. 

Welcome to the first amendment bitch. Trump's gonna rape your face."
535,"There is a similar sub: r/TheNewRight.  Let‚Äôs start posting there.  See how long it takes them to quarantine it.  Then, move to another one.  Keep up the good fight!  MAGA!  KAG!  TRUMP 2020!"
536,I'd say the biggest cucks and shills are the mods who hijacked a sub to push your trash .win site and people have caught on. Found this in another sub..

555,"Look on the bright side. By staying here, and showering coins on reddit, you're actually spending your money on a platform that's oppressing you. Would rather stay away really."
556,Unfortunately if you think they are lying then I have no way to prove otherwise.
557,Did you ever stop to think that your doing just what Spez and the rest of the cucks want us to do?  Leave and not come back. Fuck that. Bring on the fight. Win looks like a circle jerk right now. IMHO

580,I'm not I think they are targeting people based off their history and most frequent subs. Wa while I'm in TD all the time.

600,"&gt;I remember how glorious reddit was 6 years ago. The front page had real news before anyone else. You could have legitimate political discourse between party lines without being censored. The admins didnt act like the KGB, they may have even had a concious back then.

The best part, it had a lot, lot less butthurt powermods. You could insult people and they could insult you back, then (DRUMROLL) *you move the fuck on with your life*. Nowadays you insult someone and you get banned from 17 different subreddits, suspended from reddit, etc. And of course it's only selectively enforced. Socialist calls you 17 slurs, tells you to kill yourself, etc and nothing. Then  you suggest someone stop lying and you get banned"
601,"Yeah, it's weird. I have two alts that I only use for t_d. One has almost two years of nothing but pure maga. No warning."
602,The mods themselves are doing that. A bunch of cuck fucking mods trying to stop us from doing anything over here in support of our president so that we are forced to go over there to that shit hole of a site. They are really starting to piss me off.

He's surrounded by enemies, even the people listening to his phone calls. If he did order something like investigating the corruption it would be leaked and spun as a criminal act. If there ever were indictments the trial takes place in the most corrupt shit hole in the world, DC, So everybody skates while Obama judges lock up Trump allies for crimes committed by the Democrats! I didn't think Sessions would be so weak and ineffective. Whoever put Christopher Wray and Bob Mueller on his list for possible FBI directors should be fired. Like Rinse Penis recommending the hire of Rob Rosenstein.
 
#2 is big tech censorship! He won 2016 with major help from places like The Donald and Infowars, and all the shadow banning, censoring, Google/Facebook  fuckery is going to hurt for 2020

775,"The naked truth is that Sessions squandered the two best years for obtaining justice. First he begged Trump to let him have Rosenstein for Deputy AG. Then without so much as a hint of forewarning to POTUS, Sessions suddenly recused himself and turned the DOJ over to Rosenstein. Almost as quickly Rosenstein selected the dirtiest cop he could find, gave him unlimited financing and unlimited scope, and allowed him to embark on an illegal witch hunt/fishing expedition. 

Mueller showed no signs of _/ever__ ending the wrecking ball he was swinging against any and all Trump associates. Finally POTUS obtained permission from the swampy GOP senators to fire Sessions. He likely picked Barr as the only one who guaranteed to stop Mueller's rampage of out of control destruction.

Since then Barr has done little, apart from praising the indescribably unjust persecution of Roger Stone as a ""righteous prosecution."" As Devin Nunes recently put it, the swamp is bigger and deeper than even he realized. Given a second term, Trump could likely make sizable progress. [If he can get Ratcliffe confirmed as the head of DNI, that would be a massive step in the right direction.] 

 Best shot at swamp draining is Trump, most definitely. Let's get him that second term and see what happens without Sessions and Barr gumming up the works."

805,"Reddit wasn't allowing us to share our ideas and information on this sub.  We could no longer refine our arguments, strategies, and memes.

Use .win to do what this sub was once used for, then spread the memes and arguments through reddit."
806,This sub is dead. Thanks faggot spez. Fucking cuck.
807,"O course the take it seriously. But we are experiencing mass hysteria right now. People have watched too many zombie movies. This is literally the common cold. The common cold is a corona virus.

What got everyone freaked out was the Chinese government response. 

Guess what! The CCP wasn‚Äôt responding to the virus, but to the growing social instability of an economic slowdown and the spread democratic sentiment and dissatisfaction flowing into the country from the Hong Kong protests.

The declared Marshall law to remediate dissidents and to create a scapegoat, while blaming it on the the ‚ÄòAmericans‚Äô (escaped BIOWEAPON)

It‚Äôs all a hoax. The virus does nothing to healthy people more than a common cold. It IS a common cold"

810,A hoax? Are you high? It exists and it‚Äôs real. People are dying from it. Trump administration would not be taking it this seriously if they thought it was a hoax. Trump himself said this is serious and we need to get ahead of it. You sound like a leftist shill trying to make POTUS look bad. Take it elsewhere

836,Many of us have already set up accounts at thedonald.win. Join us there any time you want. Taste the freedom and deport the cucks.
837,"You cant do it with that attitude.

There's already haters over in .win. People don't just click on The_Donald by mistake. They want to know what we're saying and they need that dopamine rush from being offended."

875,"I'm beginning to think these are concern trolls. 

WIN has been solid and has supported an influx of pedes totally and completely successfully 


Why would people even want to stay here? Wtf is the point?  


But the reasons why a concern troll would want us to stay make complete sense. 

With the community on WIN we are no longer under the boot of Reddit. They can't try to neutralise the threat for the election. 


Reddit overreached and the mods went nuclear. 


The mods successfully moved a thriving community to the new platform and totally removed any control Reddit had.


Reddit lost control way too early. They can't throw us all out into the wilderness leaving us to scramble in the heat of the election, making us totally ineffective 


So out comes the ""come on guysss, stay on reddit! It's not so bad!"""

897,"Same mods that are left also own thedonald.win.

They probably made an agreement to snuff out this sub to move people over there, since it‚Äôs to their advantage. Their goal, which won‚Äôt work, is to monetize once they get as many as they can to the new site."

905,T_D was killed by a rouge bunch of mods who thought of themselves as bigger than the community.  Half of them lost control so now theyir buddies want to burn down the place so that not one of us can enjoy it.  It was not killed by the admins. The. Win site is a garbage site that no one ever sees and they'll probably try to monetize once everyone is over there.  I won't be one of them. It's a self imposed quarantine. I sincerely hope that the admins take back control and unlock it so we can enjoy it again.  I don't care who the mods are.  It's truly sad that a small handful of bad actors can ruin it for all of us.
906,Why are posts getting locked
907,Does she come with the car
908,Serious Question - If T_D is so strong then why don‚Äôt we all move to r/politics and voice our options there?  We can try to post but we could also downvote all post we don‚Äôt agree with.
909,"The point is that they said there won‚Äôt be ads. Also the mods removed t he comment I replied to which had a link to a post from the older mods who left once one half of the mod team started pushing for a new website. 

Know the full story and the context. And ask yourself why the few mods remaining here go toehoren the hassle of removing links to posts from older mods that tell their side of the story. 

Do some research about what was promised on the ad front and read both sides of the story. I would post the link to the thread some old mods made but it will just get removed. So much for free speech."

And, here‚Äôs the thing: With a bit of prep, we can deal with shill mods by making it ridiculously unwelcome as possible for them. Have all the other mods increase transparency to the point where we know exactly what each mod has moderated, so we can know exactly who the shills are and who might be legitimately trying to help. If things go wrong, we have the canary on the backup, and if that goes down we could see this place take its final stand and go down in a far more respectable way than this restricted-mode bullshit that largely solves the admins‚Äô problem for them."

928,"The power of T_D was it‚Äôs ability to disseminate ideas and quickly dismantal the Left‚Äôs narratives through our hive mind. It truly was a weapon and it made a difference last election. T_D on reddit can no longer function in this way. Until the hive is completely reassemble elsewhere, we have lost this valuable weapon. Staying here muzzled to prove a point does not actually accomplish anything of value. It divides and weekens us, and robs us of a potent weapon, and consequently advantages the Left. How many current stories have I NOT gotten the real scoop on because I‚Äôm reading a site that is censored? That is real damage to our movement and it allows the Left to more successfully advance their narrative. Just my two cents."

964,I've been silently watching the drama of T_D vs Win play out and believe you are not too far off.
965,The reddit shills on day old accounts are here commenting to sew discourse. What a sad pathetic waste of a life they have. I almost feel sorry for them.... almost.
966,This sub is pretty much dead. Spez sucks fat ones.

Almost impressive it is so slow. Maybe they're under attack I dunno. Just my experience with it.

The new site also lacks a lot of things we come accustomed to on Reddit. Like being able to see the context of things by clicking on inbox comments. On the new site you have to scroll the whole thread again.

They should've used another Reddit clone as base for the site to be honest. I think the Boat code is open source and most likely a lot better than whatever they used. Not to mention security.

God knows how many XSS/injection exploits that site still has open. Another reason to use a stable and proven platform as base."

1023,Agreed.  That meme is several layers of tastelessness.
1024,"This experiment really has been enlightening. It shows pretty clearly who is willing to cuck out and suck spez's cock.

Reddit has treated us like shit since we first opened our doors, and the mod team is finally fighting back. The woodworks here are full of sad people crying out to quit the silent resistance to the site overlords, and accept that we can never compete or fight back successfully.

Equivocations galore of ""yes, the Reddit team has always censored us and that'll never change for the better, but by not capitulating to their 'improved modding' and reopening posts here for the Reddit team to manipulate and censor, you're just as bad as Reddit is!""

You lot have officially revoked your right to ever complain again about how there are no conservative alternatives to Reddit. You were presented one, and rather than migrate and chip in to help it grow, you'd rather go back to suckling spez's dangling teat and sobbing between belches about how the milk is so bitter.

Hope you enjoy your stay at Reddit.

To the rest of the undecided lingerers, you must remember that this is bigger than just having to get used to a new forum to post memes at, with a slightly smaller but rapidly growing audience.

Reddit has demonstrated the ability and the will to interfere with elections, and made it unarguably clear that they will side with whoever is against our president; whether they be terrorists, foreign spies, or communist insurrectionists.

Staying here means voluntarily submitting to their fascist whims and Alinskyian tactics, and tacitly endorsing their efforts to do whatever it takes to shut the orange man bad down.

If you can compartmentalize that in your head alongside ""but I'm a Trump supporter :3"" and not see the contradiction, you need serious help.

2016 was bad. We saw entire subs nuked for speaking out against corruption, politically neutral subs forcibly converted to DNC recruiting grounds, liberal subs submitted to reeducation because they supported the wrong (D) candidate, and the groundwork for all the bullshit we deal with here on T_D set in stone.

As a demonstrative flex of their power, they managed to convince the #MeToo #ListenAndBelieve #VictimsofCatholicism generation that the very idea that some perverts on the left were diddling kids was absurd and preposterous, everyone knows child abuse doesn't actually ever happen, especially not in the two most corrupt institutions in the world.

That was a warmup. What do you think, 2020 is going to be just another election year? That for the last four years, they haven't been plotting out *exactly* how to make sure we don't win again?

And do you think our own best and brightest didn't put some thought into how to win again despite their anticipated machinations?

Come be a winner."

Horseshit.

Advertisers are perfectly fine with controversial material. We all know that because we all watch controversial media (at least according to their standards) and we see their commercials.

1086,"Brainwashing from a young age also helps. It's the same idea of why anyone would conform to a totalitarian ideology of punishing success and running society from the top down with an iron fist. And trust me, the socialists do NOT have low IQs. In fact, they are some of the smartest, most well educated people in the country.

They just can't differentiate what they see in reality from what they were told by their textbooks"

1091,\^ this is what a shill looks like
1092,"The new ""Win"" site sucks. I don't like the way it feels at all. Reddit is more than a general look. There's a distinct user-friendliness to its layout."
1093,Alright Eren..... we need your help here...
1094,They're not liberals anymore. They're leftists.
1095,"Wow. Did mommie kick your cage this morning? Piss in your fruitloops? 

What in the southern fried fuck did I say that was Leftist..hmmmm? 

Who brought up Russian bots? 

I welcome disagreement because it engages the mind,  and an activated almond will always seek the truth. 

How do you downgrade from an asshole? We have been partying in the hull of the titanic, and it's been the best party on this whole damn ship, but reddit keeps turning tward the iceberg. 

What do you have against capitalism? While the new site is add free now, servers and code and people's time are not free, and to think it is, is communist slavery. As long as the adds are for Trump, Trump merch, and to focus on Trump like candidates, i have no problem if they get to the point they have to run adds for  service I USE. 

And lastly,  vote Trump2020."
1096,"Bruh what? This isn‚Äôt violating your freedom of speech, though it is election meddling. It‚Äôs kinda annoying that you guys whine about mass downvoting different opinions and then downvote someone who agrees with you but corrected you."

Now they're coming for the guns."
1098,"Reddit Commies are locking down posts !!! 
Can‚Äôt we take them to court for violating our 1st Amendment Rights to Free Speech ?!"
1099,"The thing is that the left can't seem to make up their mind about this.

A private owned bakery with many alternatives can not refuse to bake a cake. Yet a giant multi million dollar company like Reddit with no real alternative with the same reach/options can refuse to bake the cake and ban anyone asking for one.

Can't have it both ways."

Haha. 


Don't forget to vote Trump 2020. He is your president shill."

&gt; 
&gt; The mods could've easily added a bunch of approved submitters. But they didn't. Why?

Maybe it has something to so with the site owners not wanting you here?   Listen to what you're saying.

Yeah, I bet that guy is just trying to get people to eat as his establishment after the other one refused to make people food has made it perfectly clear they do not want to sell you a hamburger.  The nerve of that guy wanting to sell other people things they would want to buy!"
1102,Just saw most posts are locked... damn the Reddit Commies are stifling free speech again !!!
1103,Reddit Commies
1104,This is a mess.
1105,"So you'd be okay with Reddit coming in to a sub you created, spent a lot of time growing, and removing your entire mod base because they don't like them and then installing their own without even providing substantial evidence you did anything wrong?  Cool, good for you.

I'm not happy with that but you do you."
1106,"You're complicating it. Before the mods decide to switch the sub in restive mode they could've added a bunch of people to the list so they can continue to post content without the mods having to worry that they need moderate a lot of posts. But they didn't.

They also started locking all threads here that are older than a few days. Like the Fitton threads. Why were they locked? Nobody knows cuz there's no reasons supplied."
1107,So the baker does not need to bake that cake? Private business and all.
1108,Great video.  That‚Äôs for posting.
1109,"Wrong. Reddit is technically a platform but it's acting like a publisher, abusing the protections afforded to it by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (which immunizes Reddit Inc. from any illegal content uploaded by users). By restricting content based on their political agenda they are a Publisher, which is not protected by the aforementioned law.

Reddit MUST allow free speech on their platform to remain a platform, or else they can be fined into oblivion."
1110,Joined üëç ... fuk the Reddit commie overlords!!
1111,"My best wishes for all us pedes. We need unity going into the election. But my first post on the new site was removed with no explanation.  WTF!!  Check my submission history, asshole mod, trying to censor me."
1112,"Yep, they LOVE free speech as long as it is THEIR speech.  Then a lot of the time they put on a black  mask.   Guess that is in case they want to smash a window or two and loot and destroy other peoples property as they ‚Äúexercise their free speech‚Äù.   John Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey and other Democrats that were great and built the Democratic Party must be rolling over in their graves."
1113,Burnie Free Shit Col. Sanders Suks
1114,"&gt;You're complicating it

Noi I'm not.  Reddit as a company does not want you or me using their site.

&gt;Before the mods decide to switch the sub in restive mode they could've added a bunch of people to the list so they can continue to post content without the mods having to worry that they need moderate a lot of posts.

Why?  Why should I care about what happens inside a place after they have kicked me out?

&gt;They also started locking all threads here that are older than a few days. Like the Fitton threads. Why were they locked? Nobody knows cuz there's no reasons supplied.

Because the admins want you, me, and anyone else who supports the president off their site.  Why do you want to make anything easier on them?  

You're the only one complicating things my guy.   They don't want you here so stop  trying to find ways and reasons why its bad to leave, you sound like you have battered wife syndrome."
1115,"Fuck you ‚ò≠–Øeddit‚ò≠

1116,"100% agree,  t\_d mods are admittedly who is censoring everybody from posting here, not Reddit Admins.  They want to get people on their own site.  We have no idea who even owns that site or their motives."
1117,"Duh, it‚Äôs still censorship!  If we apply the same rules to the left they should never picket a trump rally because ‚Äúit‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs rally‚Äù."
1118,"Isn't it funny how the mass demodding and mod replacements, locking out post by users, and now mass locking of the few threads that made it through all happened after the so-called transparency report had fallen off the front page?"
1119,Inside every left-winger there is a murderous fascist desperately waiting to get out. Trump's election completely exposed it.
1120,"¬†‚Äúwhen you tear out a man‚Äôs tongue, you are not proving him a liar. You‚Äôre only telling the world that you fear what he might say.‚Äù¬†"

1128,Mods were infiltrated long ago. Ever wonder why serious issues were never stickied but dank memes were?
1129,"I never said I was ok with it, buddy. It doesn‚Äôt matter if IM ok with it though because reddit is legally allowed to do it. Is it censorship? Yes. Does it violate freedom of speech? No"

Self-serving trash, not true pedes."
1133,Ever since they started ratcheting up the censorship I'm getting lots of notifications that dont show up. Likely replies and comments on my posts that are getting memory hole treatment but they're too stupid or lazy to adjust the algorithm to properly dissapeare them.

1136,They are getting us prepared should Bernie win and we have to stand in line for bread to be handed out to us once a day.  At least we don‚Äôt have to stand in line for the Reddit Masters to dole out our gift of an approved and censored post.
1137,"My authority is myself? How conceited have you become? Do you truly think that I am alone in this thought process? What of you? Do you not take the word of God as it is written? It seems to anyone looking in, that you are putting more faith in the words of men than in the words of God.  

You claim that it isn't what it means, yet it is fairly clear to us that it is pretty plain. **It isn't a mysterious saying.** *Who in history has been perfect in understanding?*  
No one except Jesus. I will take His word as it is written. It fits fairly snugly with the other concepts of God's attributes, so since it adheres so coherently, I will trust it.  

What do you trust in? That God's love is limited?  
You obviously do not have ears to hear, and still attribute the stability of your salvation to your own works.  
*If you do not believe the words that Jesus HIMSELF spoke, then how would you believe mine?*  
I am done throwing my pearls at you."
1138,#HEY REDDIT...HE‚ÄôS STILL YOUR PRESIDENT!
1139,"Yeah, that's the other thing. The ""Win"" site is not reaching anyone else. It's just a bunch of people who already agree talking among one another, achieving nothing. I don't see the site lasting or being effective.      
Best thing that we could do, in my opinion, is be open about our beliefs throughout all of Reddit, in a reasonable, thoughtful way. Lead by example. If people see Trump-voters being rational, it'll make 'em think twice, if they're the kind of person who could be reasoned with in any case."
1140,"Bake my gay cake, bigot."
1141,This reddit thing really really burns me up. It‚Äôs literally like we are in China and have no ability to use an open platform. Are there any lawyers who understand legal recourse here??
1142,Happy Sunday gun day patriots üî´
1143,"20 years ago, everything happening today would've been despicable.  Trump's policies would've been completely normal and none of this would be happening.

Then the spoiled millennial participation trophy generation grew up and graduated from Marxist universities with useless degrees, leaving them in serious debt.  None of this would've happened unless an agenda was being pushed."
1144,And the bust part is he will still be OUR President on November 4th!!!
1145,"Reddit claims it is the 'front page of the Internet,' but reddit lies. Reddit is controlled by cowards kowtowing to their cruel, Coronavirus-infect Communist Chinese masters. Reddit claims to be an information company that hides behind censorship and will ban you with extreme prejudice if you dare point out they restrict speech. 

Americans are born with the divine right to a freedom of speech. The US Supreme Court has ruled over and over again that Americans have an unfettered right to political speech.

It is generally agreed that a right to question government is fundamental to people who wish to live in an open and free society. Reddit disagrees, of course, and those quislings instead have taken the blood money and gotten on their red knees and adopted the Chairman Mao model, which is a model with an unsound Marxist method."
1146,"So stay here.  Or go somewhere else. Can't shitpost anywhere else on reddit like we did here, so it's .win for news, truth, and memes. 

And saying reddit is user frendly is like saying the trains to Auschwitz run well. They sure do..."
1147,"He was there, trying to MAGA before I even knew Trump existed."
1148,".win isnt the ark, it's the armory. 

No one is stopping anyone from engaging all of social media on all platforms, including the shitty hemmorrhoid filled asshole that is reddit.

 This Dom has been compromised by reddit admin and rather than let it be used as a weapon against our president,  it's on lockdown."
1149,"What if Twitter came in, decided it didn't like what you were posting and took over your Twitter account to start posting to it after blocking you from accessing it?

 I mean, it's a private company so they can legally do that.  Does it violate your freedom of speech?  No.

Why don't they just delete this sub?"
1150,"You even argue like a leftist. Personal attacks and no substance. You said people who you disagree with were concern trolls and Schills, how is that different from the leftists saying anyone who disagrees with them is a Russian bot. Who brought up capitalism or ads?  Transparency is completely unrelated to capitalism and you know that, don't have a good answer for it so you decided to attack. (like a leftist) You are like a fast talking salesman, lot of words but no substance. This hasn't been productive regardless of how activated your almond feels."
1151,Yes but China had SHITTY healthcare that people can stand in line for hours to get before they go back to work and work 14-16 hours for the state.
1152,"Honestly I don't even see the point of posting in our own space. Part of why I post on Reddit is because there are libs here, and libs live in my head rent-free. I need them to know that I don't like them."
1153,What is this pro Reddit admin shit? The underlying issue is caused by Reddit not the mods.
1154,I‚Äôm not fucking leaving!
1155,"Agreed it‚Äôs not enjoyable at all to browse, they need to open this back up."
1156,Open 'er up! I think there are enough of us to overcome any issues with brigading or a few bad mods.
1157,"I wouldn't consider him a liberal. He's, well...

...it's complicated."
1158,Regroup at another sub where we can still battle liberals and shills. Half the fun of the original T_D was forcing conservative topics onto the front page. Who the fuck wants to go an echo chamber?
1159,Suck my female penis or you are transphobic.
1160,I‚Äôm not a lawyer but I know that lawyers like to make money. If there were any legal recourse someone would have filed suit already. There‚Äôs nothing we can do.
1161,aka Beanie Man
1162,"They are supresssing the count as well. On July 4th they released the true numbers of people on this sub: 8.6 million joined and about 400,000 online on July 4th of last year.

I imagine since then, the numbers have drastically gone up. Especially after this debacle with the limiting of posts. When they try and censor us for no reason, we grow. It‚Äôs so sad it has to be this way in the media. It makes no sense. Why do the leftists control all of it? The right is WAY wealthier and money talks."
1163,No. Words have meaning. They can‚Äôt claim to be liberals and oppose liberty. We have to challenge them when they lie.
1164,"The people who created .win are the same dbags who won‚Äôt unlock this sub for us. How can they be Pedes if they won‚Äôt even allow for free speech? 

Go to the .win if you are done here commie."
1165,"Hey just a quick note.. If you're wondering why POTUS and/or anyone from the administration isn't even looking at this its because of what you've turned this sub into. Look at the AMA's. No one of any stature will come here any longer let alone POTUS. Call me a shill, call me whatever and that's fine. The intentions of the mods to sticky/pin offensive content and create this huge mess and force people over to this new website is blatantly obvious. Outside of the initial reporting by Breitbart and a few youtubers this story dies with the sub. Take a look at POTUS remarks this morning in regards to Sammy's Mexican Grill in Arizona. Folks are aware of whats happened here but they've also seen why. They're not touching this place. If you were rightfully wronged do you not think President Trump or someone from his Administration would have spoken out by now? Hey but what do I know..

Have a great day folks. Quite the mess you've made for yourselves."
1166,"California already has this, but I'm guessing it's selectively enforced for lefties only."
1167,"Reddit has audaciously discriminated against this sub! If Reddit was honest with itself, it would acknowledge that there's something basically wrong with having different rules for different subs.

Not to mention discriminatory algorithms!!!"
1168,"&gt; Why don't they just delete this sub?

Because they don't have to and maybe they like to watch and toy with subs? 

On Facebook you can't even post certain names without them being removed. On Twitter you get suspended if you call a guy with a beard that identifies as female a man.

Its funny that courts decided politicians can't block people on Twitter but are ok with Twitter being able to bar anyone access to their platform. So one hand they argue free speech is infringed when a political blocks you from participating in posts they make, and on the other hand they're denying access to people based on whatever they want. Courts failed here. Twitter does whatever they want."
1169,"Fucking white men.  If you wanna get the rest of reddit hard though, cut off and dye the hair green, add a nose ring, 200 lbs, and a penis then this picture could finally be beautiful and brave."
1170,reported for no cucks or leftists. This fag is a Yangbanger
1171,"It really bothers me that that nobody is talking about this on Reddit.  I don't care what your political leanings are, what Reddit Inc. is doing is reprehensible, and straight out of Nineteen Eighty-Four.  Any person who professes to value diversity of opinion, net neutrality, the market place of ideas, etc. should be outraged, yet the reddit community is silent."
1172,Bingo!
1173,"Hey m8, we don't give a shit about your fake internet points.

Using bots to mass downvotes to suppress our sub is different than some shillfag getting downvoted because he's a dipshit.

Cry more, loser."
1174,All you have to do is sorry by new. There are posts days old on that first page. I don't think I've seen a post hit an hour old every on this site. They are heavily restricting posts.
1175,"""Dat is a gooowd ting"" as bernie would say. Getting a meme every 12 hours is better than other subs who get zero memes and their subs are dying on the internet....why are communists so fucking retarded and evil?"
1176,#CHINA IS ASSHOE
1177,"The point where Reddit really went off the tracks, was when it kept moving the goal posts it. It ended up that we we required to be mind- readers of the admins, to know what we had to comply with to avoid being banned!!!"

1182,Wow that is interesting and potentially encouraging.
1183,The mods are only allowing approved posters at the moment. Several mods were removed and the remaining mods are having a hard time moderating content. Which makes sense. The left would love to creep in here and attempt to make us look bad.
1184,Radical leftists want you to believe politics is a continuum from left to right. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a continuum from liberty to tyranny.

You can't be both a liberal and a leftist, the world view is completely different.

Lots of leftists call themselves liberals. Challenge them immediately if they do so, leftists don't deserve to be called as such.

1197,They won‚Äôt unlock the sub because if you keep posting here then reddit can claim they didn‚Äôt censor the community and everything is just fine.

Win is nothing but a blinky for the whiners at this point. A fucking circle jerk. All this talk about walking away from Reddit is just what Spez and the cuck army want us to do. Stay strong. Stand your ground.
1205,Leftism: Forcibly taking from things from others than redistributing to the common man in order to buy their love is old as Julius Caesar. Perhaps far older.
1206,I‚Äôm staying right here. I‚Äôm not switching to that shitty web site. I‚Äôm not letting them win!
1207,"I prefer words like 'traitors', 'fascists', and 'monsters'.  
   
Leftists are the enemies of decency and reason.  They must attempt to suppress free speech because their ideas cannot withstand the rigors of reasoned criticism.  
  
They are, in short, the enemies of humanity."
1208,And on the 21st of January 2021.
1209,"When leftists come to power they will suffocate all ideological opponents. No due process, no path to redemption. You get thrown in the pit and that's it.    
    
Eventually other rights will hinge on your ideological score. Want to take out a car loan? Start a business? Open a bank account? Check out a book at the library? Ideological deplorables will be blocked from these kinds of transactions.  

    
This has happened before in East Bloc socialist countries. Watch the German movie *The Lives of Others*. This is what the left wants.   
   
We are the samizdat."

1211,"You got it. And there are almost a million of us subscribed here. We need to be more open throughout Reddit I think. Respectful but forthright. (Then again, Trump isn't usually respectful to those he's arguing against, so I can't say for sure what this sub's opinions are on that.)"
1212,Maybe even the 21st of January 2025...
1213,I like Tim pool
1214,I've heard they don't give a whit about spelling either.
1215,"Part of the reason why we‚Äôve been losing the culture war is because we‚Äôve allowed them to control the use of our language.  They‚Äôre no longer ‚Äúillegal aliens‚Äù they‚Äôre ‚Äúundocumented immigrants.‚Äù 

That‚Äôs what censorship is, the repression of speech.  And we‚Äôve let them softly repress our speech by changing terms, words, euphemisms....etc.  

This isn‚Äôt being contrarian.  This is taking back control of our speech.  Which ironically is why TD was quarantined and ultimately taken over by Reddit.  The denizens of TD started taking back control of their speech and it caused the overwhelmingly Leftist Reddit to lose their collective shit."
1216,TRUMP LANDSLIDE November 3rd 2020
1217,what the fuck is happening?
1218,Is Tim Pool actually liberal because he doesn‚Äôt strike me as being one.
1219,I dont understand the r/the_donald being quarantined. People should be able to see the amount of shit that comes out of this subreddit.
1220,The the mods made a mistake by pushing to the new site. It will never get as much traction as Reddit. They need to get their shit together and rebuild this place.
1221,"Thank you, sir. Can I have another!"
1222,Who needs leftist reddit admins when you have mods like these?
1223,Doesn't Tim pool claim to be a moderate?
1224,"Why don‚Äôt they turn it over to some dedicated new mods? Instead they are just ghosting us, except for when they have an opportunity to advertise for .win.

I‚Äôd rather go down swinging than go out like a little bitch, and I know my fellow Pedes would as well. Have reddit ban the sub, at least it will be a good rallying cry. Instead we are just being choked into submission."
1225,What's it like to have to defend suppression of free speech?
1226,"No one said interacting was wrong, but the poster said 'brigade', and brigading IS against the rules."
1227,"Platform vs Publisher is a real thing. 

Bigger issue is we have active mods that were here before Reddit jumped in openly stating that they‚Äôre keeping traffic light."
1228,"Why is it so hard for you to understand that Reddit is a private platform that can make up whatever rules they want. 

Your right to free speech isn't covered here."
1229,"Dude. You're an obvious shill.

Your only activity on T_D has been to bash OG_Mods and discourage people from leaving for .win."
1230,"Tim Pool isn't a journalist, he is a commentator. But we live in clown world where journalists act like commentators and commentators act like journalists."
1231,"No, they want you on the site.  They just don't want you using it the way you want to."
1232,"Who would the mods approve? Pedes? Trolls? Bernie Bros? No, they're kinda backed into a corner in that respect.

It's fine to say they should approve a bunch of new submitters, but put yourself in their place - easier said than done!!!"
1233,Dedicated new mods? Have you been paying attention? The admins booted half our mods and will make us pick new mods from an approved list they provide. How many of the people on that list are likely to be dedicated supporters of the President? And then reddit can say that we chose those mods - they weren‚Äôt forced into us.
1234,"At least my comment history is organic. How about you explain yours jabroni?

My activity is to bash mods who haven‚Äôt provided any level of transparency as to their motives or game plan."
1235,How are they not democrats?
1236,It's my long winded way of saying symbolism so yes.
1237,Hey I‚Äôm with you guys but calling Tim Pool a ‚Äúliberal journalist‚Äù at this point is a joke in itself.
1238,"&gt;Why is it so hard for you to understand that Reddit is a private platform that can make up whatever rules they want. 


Because in the sixties we decided public serving entities don't get to deny people civil rights just because they're privately owned. 


You cannot turn people away because of race or gender or religion why should politics be any different when we are a democratic republic?"
1239,"So what‚Äôs your plan? Just run away? 

Just let us post content! Or select some of the more active historic posters, and make them approved.

Only letting Fitton and the mods post is the type of fascist bullshit we deride."
1240,"is this sub dead now? i just clicked on ""new"" and there's been 3 posts in the last 24 hours...."
1241,The new site sucks.
1242,The problem is reddit had compromised the mods. They removed half the mods and are installing their own. The sub is compromised.
1243,"We are being spoon-fed a turd every 8 hours, like medicine."
1244,"Yep. The whole concept of communism is built on:

 ""These people have more shit than you do, and they probably got it by exploiting your ""labor"". Now, put me in power and Ill make sure I take their shit, and give it to you, ok? And, kill a few million people if need be"""
1245,We turn to guerrilla hit and run tactics. Coordinate at .win where admins and AHS have less power and coordinate efforts on short-lived subs back at reddit.
1246,"Because I've cleared most of my accounts in preparation for leaving Reddit.  Deleting your account doesn't delete your history.

*****
Whereas, you're arguing to stay on a compromised platform. There's no arguing that. The same people that were running T_D, are now running .win.

So there's no logical argument against going to .win. The same people running that place, were running this place, until it was compromised.

The only reason to discourage people from going to .win, is because you want them to stay on a compromised platform where they won't see new information. There's absolutely no reason to stay away from .win, unless you're a Reddit stooge.

It doesn't matter how many millions they pump into CTR/ShareBlue/ActBlue, you guys are going to lose."
1247,Mods are being martyrs. Sad!
1248,says TrollyTrolltorp
1249,Mods are doing it for some gay reason.
1250,Notice how the downvote brigade is going after anyone talking about leaving this compromised site?
1251,"I‚Äôm really shocked at many comments here. We alway talk about not wanting to support the beast, creating our own infrastructure and shit. Then Reddit slams the lid right on our faces and the mods go above and beyond to save our precious sub by putting it somewhere we can actually post what we want and people are mad??? At the mods? Not Reddit? 
Some of you wanna stay here? Were we are making spez money? Instead of finally saying FU and moving somewhere free from the chains of Reddit, censorship and Spez?
I‚Äôm confused as fuck."
1252,Two wings of the same bird.
1253,"Bernie bro's violence?  They're neutered, how can they be violent.  Pussies."
1254,"Agreed. Users should be able to view whatever conte not they want or block it.  Communists are human garbage but I prefer their thoughts and opinions to be very public for the world to see.  Free speech for ALL ideas, not just someone else's idea of 'correct' ones.

I'm a liberal and generally on the left on most issues. But the left has gone so insane and authoritarian that I now find myself relating to conservatives more than the left. They've lost their minds. 

There are a lot of us out there. 

Godspeed."
1260,"That's good to read. There are other subs to visit and contribute to and I suggest we do that...and I don't mean just Trump-focused subs. We've learned more as a group over the last few years, how to present our side more effectively with sources, memes and well-reasoned positions on topics. Trump has been/is very effective at this and we have learned new/better tactics.  We should use them to our advantage.  Good memes and short videos are **extremely** effective. Vote TRUMP 2020!"

You're a fucking liar. In multiple posts you've discouraged people from leaving Reddit, a known compromised platform, for .win, a platform created by the people who have been running this Dom from the beginning.

You are ACTIVELY advocating for people not to go there.

****
As for your Post submissions, they've been few, low energy, and far in the past.

Your only recent activity in this Dom has been to cast aspersions against the people that have been running it for years, who correctly chose to abandon it for a place where the users (us) won't be coerced.
*****
We're not arguing about my account.

Your account is full of football nonsense, and accusing the people who ran this place for years of not knowing what they're doing or being a honeytrap, all while arguing we stay here in a place we know is sinking.

I don't give a damn about your sensibilities.

Concern trolls and shills (not schills) are concern trolls and shills when they wake up in the morning,  not because they disagree with me.

""Transparency is completely unrelated to capitalism and you know that, don't have a good answer for it so you decided to attack.""

Transparency and capitalism are completely related. Transparency builds trust, and that trust leads to capitalistic gains. Would you get your brakes done by a buisness you don't trust? Would anyone? Would that lack of trust lead to a failure of their capitalistic endeavor? Puhhhleaze.

1292,I can‚Äôt post your comment on most anything. This is insane and stupid and if the mods at the win are controlling the restrictions here that is stupid and off putting. The win should not control if i can post or not on reddit based on nothing. I never have gotten a warning let along broken a rule. This is stupid on Reddit‚Äôs part and the mods on both sites.

If you go back through the Now recently locked threads you will see much of it has been **scrubbed** of links to evidence that back up the concerns of many pedes.

4 - Again. It's not either/or. I can stay here, fuck with paid shill posters, and enjoy myself, while still accessing .win.

There's not going to be a large-scale migration unless Trump himself tweets to stop using Reddit.

1364,"While Reddit and the Deep Left do have significant ties to China and their Communist Party; lets not forget the EU has been on a disinformation and communist propaganda campaign against the US since the moment Trump was elected. 

Normalizing censorship, socialism via tax slavery, enforced diversity and white genocide via a constant and endless flow of radical migrants, secularism and anti-theism, climate alarmism. The list goes on. Even their leaders are openly vying to undermine Trump, the US and everything America stands for. 

China has always been a threat and even moderate Lefties can see that, but the EU *will* meddle in the election especially if it means turning America into a communist regime likes theirs."

1406,"I do hear a couple of rumors due to being here for a while but I like to stick to facts. The most important algorithm is the one that ranks posts and determines which ones are on the front page.

Most of the traffic on reddit goes to something called 'popular' and to a much lesser degree 'all'. Essentially you can do a spot check by opening reddit from a device where you are not logged in. What you see then is what gets most of the clicks and views. 

So in that sense we are way past algorithm manipulation because Trump supporters are simply banned (for a long time) from being able to appear at these places where most of the traffic is. I think factually it was more than a year since the last post from a Trump supporter was allowed to be seen by the general Reddit audience. 

Heavy restrictions started in 2016 after the election and gradually escalated to be worse and worse such as in 2020 it is pretty much impossible for the average user to find Trump supporting content on Reddit unless they deliberately trying to seek it out.

God's love is not limited, that is what the passage means.   You are correct about that.  The part that is not contained is the concept that after you accept Jesus' love it becomes impossible for you to reject it.  Even if you do reject it, God does still love you.  He even loves the people in hell.  However, you can still choose to reject Him if you want to.  The passage does leave open the possibility that you could be correct, however it also leaves open the possibility that a person could reject God's love.

You expect trump to defend your values/wants/needs but you refuse to go fight for him bc why? *""reddit is a liberal shithole""* is a pussy excuse. U want to enjoy all the things trump has done for us, but u dont want to take a stand to defend him. It absolutely disgusts me.

For anyone interested in fighting the good fight, Go out, stay 100% RESPECTFUL in your arguments, and lay down hard truths. Make these liberals either concede, or give up arguing u. We have the facts on our side, use them. DO NOT be a dick. When u argue for trump and his ideas, you are representing our president. If the argument turns dirty, let them destroy themselfs, do not engage. Stick to the truths. The first person who turns a respectful debate into a pissing match loses, ALWAYS. Whe. That happens, you, and everyone else reading, know you won."
1525,"People really don't understand the Streisand effect. The more you try to cover up something, the more people will find out about it.

If you address it and move on, it's forgotten quickly. If you deny and complain about it, it will last as long as you live.

If Reddit was smart, they would have left the site, posts and comments alone, but by doing shit like this meant a huge backfire.

The Dems don't even understand something simple as this, and that is a huge reason why they continue to lose, along with many other reasons."

That's the exact line Leftists use about T_D.

&gt; We aren‚Äôt going to red-pill the front page or moderates from there.

We're not going to do it from here, either. Reddit SuperMods keep our posts from the front page, and the only moderates who come are to see the ""true racist nature"" of T_D and stay when they realize it's all facts, fun, and memes. 

&gt; We can‚Äôt grow the movement from a webpage with just our traffic.

That was never the goal. T_D is a place where news articles are posted for discussion by thousands of conservatives and relative connections are made. Ripping through the Wikileaks emails, making connections in P_G. That's what T_D is for.

Anyone that wandered in and found that trove of information, that's what the page is about. It's not about changing the ways of people already dead set in their ways.

&gt; The mods that left had the better idea

No mods have left. They've all been systematically stripped of their powers by Reddit. Every time they've made a stand, they've been swatted down.  Your very premise that the ones who wanted to get us out of quarantine simply *left* is flawed. If they truly thought that, they would have persevered and stayed.

&gt;  I‚Äôll be here supporting a new sub that isn‚Äôt quarantined.

The only way this sub isn't quarantined, is if its under the control of Reddit approved mods. It'll be a duplicate of /redacted.

*****
The only solution is to set up a fallback beachhead on .win and any other places we can gather. Posting here is fine, but over time any posts that run counter to ""Reddit Approved"" will be pruned along with their users.

It's pointless to contemplate remaining in enemy controlled territory. A fallback position is needed, with the most likely being .win for now.

There's a difference between ""jumping ship"" and abandoning this place.

What OGIE is doing, is saying ""ignore that other place, stay here on an obviously compromised platform.""

Do you see the difference? I'm advocating to create a presence on .win to use as a beach head against this place.

*****
If you stay, you're staying on their terms. I'm fine with that. I'm also staying, and not going to give in to whatever tin-pot dictators they install as the new T_D overlords.

But while this place exists, we need to maintain the coherency of the userbase, make them understand this is no longer a safeground, and get them to congregate in a secure location to coordinate further resistance.


So no, you're not a leftist shill, unless you're also running around discouraging people from moving to .win and saying that our OG_Mods are complicit with Leftists.

Which doesn't even make sense. If the OG_Mods are complicit, how is going to .win any worse than staying here?"
1603,"I will give new mods the benefit of the doubt that they 100% own .win, and their intentions are ""good"". But its absolutely the worst way to go about this.

They should have stickied .win and the canary link, kept the sub open, and let leftist admins take control and shut down the sub. Once it came to light that admins pushed out mods and took over to shut it down, it would have rocked the site as a whole.

Instead, they locked the sub down and jumped ship which, to me, shows compliance to their wishes that this sub be destroyed. 

The arrogance of new mods thought process of ""if the sub is going down, it's going down on our terms"" is horrible. They gave leftist reddit exactly what they wanted for the least amount of effort. Now this whole story dies off and nothing will ever come from it. The biggest trump sub dies and leftist get their ""win""

1639,"&gt; They will say the reason they did it is bc we are ""violent and unruly"".

Which is why OG_Mods locked submissions. Their reasoning is they can't control content. Thus, if Reddit Supermods unlock submissions before putting in new mods, it's on their heads. Thus, the new mods aren't going to allow anything Reddit doesn't like. So it's a time game.

.win is composed of the OG_mods from here who saw the writing on the wall. In any case, this place is already doomed, so there's zero reason to also establish a presence there. Fucked anyway, right?

******
Point being, if .win is compromised, nobody can argue to stay here and not also move there.

Likewise, anyone arguing to abandon this place only in favor of .win has a flawed perspective.

It's either keep up a presence here and there, until shut down, or just stop all online activities.

1660,"I realize this is besides the point, but out of curiosity is Pool really a liberal? I watch him a good bit and am surprised by that.

Edit: I see his Twitter says ""disaffected libreal"". I could see that"
1661,"Edit: Had outdated info, you apparently used to be on Godaddy, which was a trashfire, but you‚Äôre now on Epik. That‚Äôs a start."
1662,Liberal cocksuckers have shut down posts.  I‚Äôve only seen a few new ones the last few days. WTF!
1663,"Fuck reddit only reason I came was for the_donald I would give them so many page clicks 
This place did nothing wrong, just leftists and their book burning"
1664,"How? I‚Äôve literally upvoted every true comment about spez, especially the ones about him taking it in the ass by the chicomms."
1665,A 'true' map of China would consist _only_ of Taiwan...
1666,I don‚Äôt agree with you but I upvoted because I miss these kind of comments.
1667,"Warnig --- Admins want us to self deplatform. They have no plan on reopening this sub, they want us all off their site so that we can no longer downvote communism and dispense redpills. Leaving is surrendering. Thedonald . win is a compromised echo chamber where your message will not be heard by anyone outside of that site. The admins are in control of both sites, and thedonald . win was made using part of reddits code. When we didn't leave willingly, Reddit decided to shut us down to force us to leave. Leaving is surrendering."
1668,"Not sure, they didn't point out which one. I assume it was one of the tranny fluid posts."
1669,"How the fuck are they giving out warnings when there‚Äôs fuck all left to upvote? There are literally only 3‚Äîcount them‚Äî3 new posts today. And as usual Tom is the main one (not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with that, and I expect it may be a little 4D chess by the remaining mods to remind Reddit that we have Legal Hulk on our side), with some days having only one new post in all of the Dom."
1670,"Are we still here? Are we still fighting? Not leaving because a communist told me too, and you?"
1671,Are the chicomms also paying your commie ass too? What you dumbasses fail to realize is that you will be next. Because at some point the shit hole you‚Äôll create with that kind of attitude will have you speaking out against it. And guess what? Not a soul will be there in your defense.
1672,That's what's going on?!  I was shocked at the tiny number of posts under the new tab.  This is so ridiculous!
1673,Never surrender brother we can still fight to get it back

1676,"Romans 5:8 ""God shows His love towards us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more having been reconciled , we shall be saved by His life. ""  Jesus died for us while we were sinning, what have your Gods done to rescue us from the wheel of reincarnation? It is not God as what we want Him to be, it is God as He is.  He deserves worship because He created you and you did not create God.  In His wisdom He sacrificed His Son for our redemption.  What is the wisdom of the Hindu Gods to end nirvana and end reincarnation?  Where is the love of the Hindu Gods? Who decides when I have attained nirvana?  I to accept your free will given by God to chose or deny the sacrifice of Jesus. Worship what you will, but salvation is found only in Jesus, ""Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved"" Acts 4:12"

1680,"That doesn't help but it doesn't mean the fanbases can't work in mutually beneficial fashion. It would be a lot harder for this censorship to flourish if a  more left leaning group was calling it out while they are currently uncensored. 

Going forward I'm going to be a lot more understanding and supportive of Bernie supporters and remain critical to the rest of the dems."
1681,What reddit did was fucked up but we can't let spez win. The fun with t_d is commingleing with normies and red pilling them.

1684,When do you expect an update on our situation?
1685,It's complicated.
1686,That's why they scream at you and try to shut your voice down. They know their position is weak and ultimately indefensible and this is the exact reason they put feelings over facts in their deluded minds.

1690,"So, effectively, we lost.


Tim already pointed out the ridiculous bullshit that was the cause of the quarantine. Call of violence toward police by Trump supporters? I remember a lot of head scratching on that one, but it still faded from memory."
1691,"I like Tim, but he's an idiot a lot. Good video though"
1692,I upvoted as many of those as I could ü§î
1693,"Same logic applies to the writings about Alexander the Great. So the question becomes, what else did Alexander's general's get right?

I thought that was against your religion? Or do you practice Taqiya?"

This comment was paid for by Vladimir Putin."
1701,"I don‚Äôt get where Reddit even thinks they‚Äôre that important. I know like 5 people who use Reddit, while most others have barely heard of it. It‚Äôs like a 4th tier social media platform."
1702,Including releasing a virus like Corona.
1703,Red Letter Media!
1704,"It‚Äôs actually the current mods, who have been around forever. It‚Äôs their mechanism to force people over to the new website."

1719,we're POWs
1720,Shit theres nothing to do here. The other site works fine. And I hear an app might be in the works.
1721,"The mods did it because they say they can't control the shills any more, so they want everyone to go to w w w  . TheDonald.win"
1722,"yes, only beanie wearers and men with huge triceps can post new threads"
1723,"Maybe 96.. nix that, 1992.. wow."
1724,"Just received my warning from Spez  
Not using the 3 sea shells..."
1725,"So basically the Donald only allows Tom fitton and one other guy to post. And everybody's okay with this? All the support this sub has gave and not a peep from the president. üòî 
I wasn't tired of winning. And this certainly doesn't feel like winning."
1726,"This guy's face spamming this sub reddit will get me over to [thedonald.win](https://thedonald.win) faster then the admin censorship. The first 7 posts are pictures of him, it's annoying"
1727,this is what im starting to believe as well.
1728,Fuck China. Shithole country.
1729,"Nothing yet, wont see her again until Wednesdays"
1730,"I would say it's been great serving with everyone and just move on over to the Donald. Win, but that's pathetic. It will get shut down just as fast. I will stick to my private social media groups. Done with Reddit. Done with the Donald. Fuck this. Did not realize it was ran by such cucked bitches. why would I ever go to their new site when all they ever did was Bend the knee to spez and hand over the forum to Tom fitton?!?! He's posting away like he hasn't even noticed no one else can.. can't stand those Democrats elitist that are allowed privileges the rest of us aren't right guys? Seriously disappointed and pissed off. Best of luck guys. I guess Trump has bigger things to worry about now then the people who got him elected. he has done nothing to stop any of the censorship. It keeps getting worse and worse. For great theater you need great actors. His words not mine. So done with this. So disappointed."
1731,And yet they'll still lose in the end.
1732,I like what he has to say. 98% agree overlap by my estimation. It's just something about his voice I can't stand.
1733,How many times you gonna cry about it
1734,"First off, I won't lie, don't have to, and you will take that accusation back.
 The same logic is supposed to apply to the NT and the writings of Alexander the Great. Unfortunately, stupid delusional atheists don't apply the same logic to both. When we study ancient historical documents, we are supposed to find consistency in the text on our own because we can't ask the writers for clarification. Ancient history scholars do this with all ancient documents except for atheists who search for inconsistencies in the NT documents. They don't treat the writings of Alexander the Great this way. I also never said the NT was the only ancient document that has had things proven correct in them so I don't know where you got that idea from except for your imagination.
Once again, I'm not being deceitful so take it back or this conversation is over."
1735,"THANK YOU!!!! 

Bunch of losers who don't know how to fall back and re-group. Reddit has always been the battleground, and The_Donald our home base.....  but it's been cut off from supplies ( removed from r/all and quarantined and overrun by shills, redditfags, and concern trolls) and rather than let them  change it to an 'I just don't know about X policy' and use it against President Trump , it's been put on pause."
1736,Eyyyy!  What up Bucks fan!
1737,As much as I feel like. Bootlicker.
1738,"At least one more.

For all the bitching the userbase and mods did about Spez...  it was the mods themselves who brought down T_D."
1739,"Look im not happy about this censorship. And frankly, reddit has become unbearable, unfortunately even here on the donald at times. Its so clear weve been brigaded for a long time now.
But one thing that keeps sticking out to me, is the constant shilling for thedonald.win
Im not making accusations without proof, but it seems like a honeypot to me. Ive yet to go there because of that intuition feeling. 

It also seems as though shills and unwitting participants are claiming defeat and to retreat to their safe space known as thedonald.win.

Do you think soldiers retreat when there is an ambush? No. You go right at the enemy. You dont sit there and take shot after shots. You dont retreat. You go full force at the enemies. 
And make no mistake we arent brave soldiers on the ground, but this is an information war. We are internet soldiers like General Mike Flynn says.

We are never out of the fight."
1740,"Dear reddit admins, 

Go suck some chi-commie cock you filthy libtards."
1741,Because the current mods aren't interested in doing their jobs here anymore - they've all run off to their new site.
1742,"What they say is true though. I'm not even American let alone Conservative but I subbed here immediately after it was put in quarantine. I'm not a child that needs to be told what I can and can't read.

The sad reality is that even the mere act of subbing here will have negative consequences for you outside of this sub. 

Make sure to check your comments to see if they are shadow-deleted. The easiest way to do this is by copying the ""permalink"" of your comment and then pasting it into an incognito browser to see if you can still read your comment. It happens to me extremely often in left leaning subreddits."
1743,"tim pool churns out a lot of low quality clickbait content for shekels.   He stretches the truth to sensationalize it 90% of the time.   He has some 10 second story and then drags it out into a 20 minute video bitching about it, just like sargon.  I don't like that style."
1744,All part of every socialist agenda ever.
1745,You didn‚Äôt leave the party. The party left you.
1746,Thank you
1747,No shit half of them removed and are shills now. Its preemptivly over before a bunch concern shills like you flood the movement. Reddit is done. It's over. Time to move on

1759,Fuck Reddit
1760,"Honestly. I think the admins are being super stingy. They don't want DT to win so they're trying to censor our voice. I'm no lawyer, but we do have a right to Free Speech and them trying to unconditionally silence us is complete BS. I think these could be grounds for a lawsuit."
1761,"&gt;And make no mistake we arent brave soldiers on the ground, but this is an information war.

Is its existence somehow preventing you from spreading your own message whatever that is?"

1779,I feel like the mods just want to drive traffic to .win.
1780,"Yeah, you're right - giving mods at a site without an EULA, and no terms, access to your personal information is a far better plan."
1781,"we should support our current mods, get out of this fucking quarentine"
1782,"I would rather have you guys shut down this domreddit than have it taken over by shills and eventually used to gas light potential voters who come here.

It's crazy over there. Nothing but echoes, ghosts, spooks, and people getting deported for trying to drop red pills. They want that site to be a communist version of what the\_Donald used to be.

1787,"These cunts who claim to hate fascism are the most fascistic, ironically."
1788,Censorship is anti American. Beginning of the end of America as we know it. No society can remain free when you start shutting down dissenting voices
1789,"Can a mod give a substantive update on what's going on with the T_D? If not here, then give one over at thedonald.win because we deserve an update.

1790,"I support Donald Trump because he causes so much drama like Tay Tay and not for his political work. He is a god-emperor when it comes to meme-ing, but when it comes to being a president, he is stale bread."
1791,Delete the sub
1792,Violence and censorship towards conservatives are perfectly fine here on Reddit.  Even a simple disagreement towards a liberal opinion is grounds for a suspension or ban.
1793,Fuck reddit.
1794,"This right here. We‚Äôve all been doing this awhile, I think the mods got a liiiiitle too self-important.  This community can handle a couple shitty mods. Believe me."
1795,Our mods have no say in the quarantine. We‚Äôre in the quarantine for political purposes. Nothing we say or do will get us out until at least after the election.
1796,It will get better.
1797,President Trump needs to do another AMA here and then take Reddit to court over election interference.
1798,"My biggest complaint is the restriction on allowing new posts. We should be free to post any content that doesn't break reddit's published rules. Your mod drama and deleting peoples comments or posts is exasperating and against the rules of fairness. I can only conclude, that there are nefarious players/intent at work, and that there is *extremely biased*, purposeful &amp; illegal silencing of conservatives in an election year.  People should never be punished for supporting our duly elected President. This behaviour is shocking. Reddit is doing everything it was originally against. Stop being Evil."
1799,Meh. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs more left than moderate simply on the fact that he refuses to acknowledge Trump was the best candidate even after he made the declaration to pull out of Afghan.
1800,"Reddit, you never answered me last time.

Why is GenderCritical still a sub if pm_doggos broke the rules with a bad joke?

Force them into the situation they don't want, rather than doing exactly what they want this sub to do...whither and die on it's own.

Geee. No one give this guy a America history book. He might accuse the founding fathers of saying ""Yes big daddy Britain, we'll sit outside. No need to kick us out"" 


I guess some people just like being rule over.  



Seriously...What would you want to accomplish by returning everyone here? 


Let's work this through because obviously you don't have much of a mind for strategic thinking. 


We bring everyone back, the mods appease the admins, admins install new mods, they're total shills (who knows, maybe you might want to apply) 


Things continue on like mostly normal. The community and mods keeps jumping through arbitrary hoops and the new mods are there to ensure the community doesn't commit acts of wrong think 


The new mods want to weaken the ""pro-trump only"" stance to make this place more welcoming and a place for political debates and conversations. The old mods disagree and are immediately kicked out for not complying.  

This goes on. The new mods also want to tackle ""toxic content"" so memes are more tightly restricted. Can't be anything too controversial or effective. The memes in your post history would be fine, they'd only be interested in effective ones. Eventually the only acceptable content would be need articles from MSM, Tweets and shit tier memes. 

The Donald continues to limp along as a pathetic shell of what it was ""hey, but at least we're still on Reddit! We showed them!"" you and the small handful of people who desperately wanted us to return would no doubt say. 

The atmosphere of the place is basically gone but people still keep checking because where else can they go to find info on the election with a trump/conservative focus. 


The election heats up. Reddit admins just happen to decide the community has finally broken one too many rules and shuts the whole place down. 


Of course they'll just happen to discover this rule breaking behaviour right at the most politically opportune time! 


Now we all get to reeeee like little bitches about how poorly treated we were by Reddit. Great. 


Meanwhile the entire community of Trump supporters is left scrambling. 


If you believe that this community did actually help Trump win the election, well he just lost that help he had last time because the community is now lost and trying to regroup while. 


But congratulations. You walked right into their trap. You showed them. 


You played just like an old school conservative. Expecting fairness and everyone to play by the rules. Old school conservatives have been playing that game for years and they've been getting cucked again and again. I heard Mitt Romney has an opening for head of strategy. You should apply.  


The correct way to handle this is to migrate to WIN, coordinate from there and fight back using WIN as a home base that's untouchable by Reddit"

Dot win is a really nice site (I go there too) but it‚Äôs election year and we need to be in the thick of things.

1874," REPLACE ALL MODS, GIVE CONTROL TO REDDIT IN ORDER TO OPEN THIS SUB BACK UP!!!

Warnig --- Admins want us to self deplatform. They have no plan on reopening this sub, they want us all off their site so that we can no longer downvote communism and dispense redpills. Leaving is surrendering. Thedonald . win is a compromised echo chamber where your message will not be heard by anyone outside of that site. The admins are in control of both sites, and thedonald . win was made using part of reddits code. When we didn't leave willingly, Reddit decided to shut us down to force us to leave. Leaving is surrendering.

They are in full communism mode over at thedonald . win. Just post anything that goes against the echo chamber and you will quickly have 2 or 3 people saying that they deported you. It's is crazy bad. What I posted here is still up, and I haven't been banned yet, yet if I posted the EXACT SAME THING word for word on thedonald . win I would be banned in less than 20 minutes (mods are slow). Don't believe me try it your self. Copy and paste the above paragraph, head over there, reply to any post, or post it yourself, and you will be quickly banned. They are now banning IP's of known common VPN's, banning based on user name, they have an upvote bot installed to artificially increase appearance of users, and they use the upvote bot to mass upvote certain posts to currate their hot, and top pages. ... It's crazy over there. Nothing but echoes, ghosts, spooks, and people getting deported for trying to drop red pills. They want that site to be a communist version of what the\_Donald used to be.

How long does it take to approve mods? Why are mods allowed to spam advertisements trying to get us to leave? Why has admins not just taken the sub over, and replaced the mods? Answer: they are working together."

I'd prefer Trump not pull a bloomberg.

Besides that, if Trump has 8 years to prepare for a point where he's no longer in office, I would hope that he's created a guide on how to make other KAG candidates continue his legacy.

If the administration is depends solely on Trump's leadership, it probably won't last when Trump finally leaves office. The real trick isn't to keep Trump in office as long as possible, but for Trump to find people who can follow in his footsteps."

1988,"I urge you all to not pack up your bags and go to .win (unless you can stay on both platforms). Reddit wants us to leave. We have to stay and continue redpilling other subs. Once we leave, they win. We aren‚Äôt spreading our ideas on .win, only echoing them amongst ourselves."
1989,"Only people who were mods or have a verified tag, similar to a twitter check.  I don't believe any of us  regular peon  users were or ever  will be verified."

1994,"it feels to me and many others that the mods are just buttsore having put so much into t_d and being taken out. if people like me were wrong, they would be posting discussion threads and talking to the community rather than PERMA BANNING hundreds of MAGA pedes for speaking out..."
1995,"Yeah, let's live in fear of them and cower to them

Fuck that.  islam is trash"
1996,"Wait, isn't it Reddit's first amendment right to be able to host the content they want on their platform?"
1997,He's a liberal. He's just not an SJW.
1998,He said many times he won't vote Democrat when their party is in it's current state
1999,nope. not unless they want to be a Publisher...then they would be held responsible for what they publish. they have a special designation...reddit is a platform designated by congress and they work the grey area by banning/stifling ideas they do not wish to promote.
2000,It's broken right now.
2001,"I'm looking forward to the Bernie Brown Shirts riots.

Should be fun watching them destroy both themselves and the Democrat party!

2081,"I didn't say ""democrat"", I said ""left""."
2082,"I'm sure there were no south american groups or NGOs running ads against Trump trying to influence the election, surely, they would never do that, especially not with aid money that was funneled to them through Obama's slush fund, and Soros would NEVER fund anything like that, nor spend a fortune trying to help liberals all over the country get elected. But 100,000 dollars in facebook ads definitely cost them the election, because it's not like Hillary didn't spend almost a Billion dollars."
2083,Me too.
2084,Is TD win down for anyone else?
2085,Anyone else having issues with thedonald.win?

2096,The few mods that Reddit didnt remove forcibly. They've put sub in restricted mode as they have to few mods to handle brigade bots trying to post bannable content.
2097,Yeah this doesn't seem to be a traffic issue...
2098,Welcome to the gulag.
2099,Can't feel sorry for them either. If they still can't see right from wrong in this current culture war then you just have to assume they know damn well what they are doing are just plain evil. No more pretending everyone is good inside.

2103,"At the moment, a lot of people can't get through to .win at all, and people are coming here to compare notes. Might want to wait a while longer to self-delete."
2104,"He‚Äôs got that high pitched thing going on, much like Ben Shapiro and Crowder.  Also, all three of them speak way too fast and stutter hard.  Makes them sound low T and nervous, which translates into making their audience feel uncomfortable as well.  I wish they would slow down a bit and bring down the pitch of their voices several octaves.  Joe Rogan speaks lower and slower and I find him to be relaxing and therapeutic to listen to.

Tim, I know you browse TD.  If you see this, it may do you well to consult with a speaking expert, like an expert that can coach you on giving speeches.  I watch every one of your videos and I say this with all due respect, so please don‚Äôt take it the wrong way.  I just think it could help increase your viewership."
2105,"Better than the corporatism your crook supports anyway, I'd rather risk hurting the economy then indirectly murder millions like your pres is doing."
2106,Apparently a huge conservative has just bought a majority stake in Twitter. I hope this is the beginning of the end for leftist censorship and double standards. Fire Jack Dorsey too.
2107,Open this shit back up. Petey just dropped out and I need to see all the shitposting. Reddit admins can go fuck themselves.

2155,"Jesus tap dancing Christ! You're about as organic as the influencers Bloomberg pays! Let's break down a few key points of your argument:

""He might accuse the founding fathers of saying..."": I don't remember the Founding Fathers giving up and moving to Canada... what History books do you have?

""We bring everyone back, the mods appease the admins..."": Why do you think anyone would expect the impossible? I'd rather force them to do what they're actually trying to do than hand them a .win on a silver platter! And it's no surprise to anyone that iVaginary, who was behind the coup in the first place, is the top mod left after Reddit axed everyone who wanted to go to .win anyway. Crazy how that works, y'know?

""Hey, but at least we're still on Reddit!"": The Donald is a battleground. It's not about ""at least being on Reddit"". It's about being in the public forum. The more heavy handed Reddit gets, the more people can see what's going on... just like how the Bernie Bros are waking up to the nonsense the DNC pulls. If it can happen to The Donald, all other subreddits are put on notice.

""The atmosphere of the place is basically gone..."": Right, because the turncoats mods whose cocks you suck did that to try and force everyone to migrate to the site owned by them. GEE!

""The memes in your post history..."": TOP KEK! You really are a leftist, huh? Goin' through my post history. Did you want Q memes or something? Because those are verbotten.

""...this community did actually help Trump win the election, well he just lost that help he had..."": A-GEOTUS doesn't need T_D to get re-elected. B-You're fucking delusional if you think he does, and even more so if you think .win will help him.

""You walked right into their trap."": Yes... you did. You followed their Pied Piper right out of town. -slow clap for your slow mind-

""The correct way to handle this is to"" piss in their eye by refusing to budge. If they want us gone, they know what to do. But hey, you feel good that you followed a hippy to a second location, thus giving Spez and Conde Nast and Advance Publications exactly what they wanted: A victory where you fucked off, The Donald is ""dead"", and they can't be blamed for its shut down. YOU SURE SHOWED THEM!

2172,"Imagine having T_D as a sub and not having a mega thread about Peteyboy and Steyer dropping out.

Mods are as weak as Jeb Bush."
2173,"This absolutely isn't true. I would love for you to show me a case in a court of law where the publisher argument actually succeeded. A private platform has a right to designate what kind of content they want on their platform, as upheld by Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck. From the Wikipedia page on the issue:

 ""Justice Kavanaugh wrote the majority opinion, finding that MNN could not be considered a state actor in how it operates, and as such, was not bound to protect free speech rights as a state actor would be expected. The Court stated that the MNN is immune to the First and Fourteenth amendments due to its status as a private company. The opinion argues that First and Fourteenth Amendments only apply to ‚Äúgovernmental abridgment of speech‚Äù and not to ‚Äúprivate abridgment of speech‚Äù (Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., Hudgens v. NLRB, and Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo). In order for an organization to be seen as governmental, private companies must be a state actor, meaning an organization that exercises ‚Äúpowers traditionally exclusive to the state‚Äù, defined from the case Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co. and the action must have been originally and solely performed by the government (Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, Evans v. Newton).""

If I made a website with a chatroom, why should I be forced to pay money to let you say whatever you want in it? Conservatives care about the first amendment except when it hurts them."

I would just like to say that the Mods of this subreddit can go fuck themselves. Reddit admins are a bunch of virgin cucklord pieces of garbage. This won't win you 2020. Can't wait to watch you retards meltdown. Again, and I mean this in every way possible, GO FUCK YOURSELVES. Scum of the earth trash. Now go watch Tyrone fuck your wife."
2182,"Nobody said it was easy. But if the soldiers of the meme war retreat to their safe space (thedonald.win), then I don't think it's a step toward winning the meme war. Reddit is the front line of the meme war, so why leave?"

2184,And then they realize Donald J Trump has 4 full years of unrestrained pay back.
2185,"Your intuition is not far from the truth.

.win is a legit site, bit there are shenanigans afoot.  Evidence posted here seems to result in a ban.  It is available.  It doesn't seem to me like any party is truly innocent and mod infighting seems to be the underlying issue.

I suspect reddit admins have a lot less to do with this than we are being told.

I do suggest going to thedonald.win, it's a good place to have some shitposting fun without real fear of reproach, bit there are other good subs here that are taking an influx of pedes from here."

2188,"Of course there is a pro Bernie sub that focuses on political memes on the front page of reddit right now but god forbid there is a conservative sub spreading political memes too. Can't have two! That would be something called choice.

 Reddits tactic of spreading communist propaganda is so fucking blatantly obvious. Reddit is an American company spreading Chinese Government communist propaganda during an election cycle. It's time for this to end."

In Americas population, that's over 150,000 people who's gender is straight up, medically, not determinable by the average person. For at least some of them, the parents are asked what they prefer, and corrective surgery is made. The kid is sometimes none the wiser for the rest of their lives. Perhaps even your parents made the difficult decision when you were born. Something to think about. Just because you think its so obvious doesn't mean it is. Its seems pretty obvious that the sun revolves around the earth until you get a different perspective"

2206,Fuck Reddit!!! Trump 2020 you whining leftist communist bitches
2207,where is it now?  I must be blind I don't see it on the first 3 pages
2208,When is this sub going to open back up? What the fuck is going on?
2209,"Yeah, I know most Yanggangers are diehard conservatives, right? Idiot."
2210,"I mean it‚Äôs basically gone now, right? One post a day? It‚Äôs done with."
2211,I agree. many original maga pedes are getting tossed like a side of beef for saying as much.
2212,It‚Äôs honestly quite alarming. The absence of logic (ignorance) will be the end of us all..
2213,IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT!!!
2214,"Well, that‚Äôs very interesting.  Innit?  It had almost 1k upvotes within minutes.  What possible reason would there be for not posting them or taking them down?"
2215,I honestly think he is an in-the-closet trump supporter. Not sure why he doesn‚Äôt just admit it
2216,I don't know fill me in
2217,Laverne and Shirley entered the chat.
2218,"I really hope people see through and call out people calling Bernie Sanders a Nazi. No fan, but holy shit, just call him a degenerate N****, we know that's what is in their head. Other people must hear that when they (at least Chuck Todd) says it."
2219,I don‚Äôt know either.  Just odd that a sub about a person doesn‚Äôt include his words to us.
2220,.win sucks. It‚Äôs an echo chamber that reaches no one
2221,"Normally it wouldn't be. Context matters, because you're clearly not pushing the philosophical or historical value of either testament.     
If a Jewish treasure map finds treasure, then the the god of Adam and Isaac is real... üëå"
2222,So how do I post here?
2223,"I saw the notification come up on my phone, but when I checked it was no where to be found. 

There's lots of that shadow banning going on right now."
2224,Only one person thinks Tim Pool is a liberal. Tim Pool. Dude is closet red pill addict.
2225,Like releasing coronavirus and using it to try to tank the stock market. Then writing ridiculous news stories to put the blame on Trump.
2226,"You have to compare American politics with the rest of the world, America it right and then even more right. Yang would be considered kinda conservative along with pretty much everyone but Bernie yang coming in close second to him because of where the democrats are now, the conservatives in England are equivalent to democrats in America"
2227,"unlike the_donald, which is definitely no echo chamber!!!"
2228,Yeah to say the least
2229,"god, hopefully you leave reddit lol"
2230,"yes, leave reddit lol"
2231,"thats what you want in a president! ""pay back"" against his American citizens!"
2232,nah. big tech is shitting all over the grey area and kavanaugh can go fuck himself. i never liked that swamp rat bush establishment dick sucker.
2233,it probably wont. and we cant close it permanently because the reddit admins will just reinstate it and use it for their own devices.
2234,Most of us were probably banned from Twitter long ago.
2235,Counting down before the admins lock this post.
2236,Gotta go to donald.win - this sub has been nuked :(
2237,Not sure why you‚Äôre being downvoted. It‚Äôs absolutely a political tool. It‚Äôll return to normal quarantine state post election
2238,"On Reddit we reach others, on .win, we don‚Äôt"
2239,"Going through the grief stages. Denial, Anger, Sadness, Bargaining, and Acceptance. 

Looks like I‚Äôm in the Bargaining stage."
2240,"Haha ... I liked the idea. üòÅ

Basically we‚Äôre just talking amongst ourselves here. And dotwin would be more of the same. 

Why not publicly show our support to the masses on a very visible platform. 

Even though Twitter is a cancer. I‚Äôd do it till after the election. üòä"
2241,"Liberal self-image.  They desperately cling to social liberalism even when they become politically and financially conservative.  Dave Rubin too.  Their view of conservatives was skewed by the kool-aid they were fed for so long and they have trouble facing that, so they tend to cast it as conservatives are changing.  The further they come along the more they realize they were just wrong and their views are shifting, not that we are the ones shifting."
2242,"and just like an addict, pretends he is not"
2243,"I got the warning and then got suspended when I replied to the mods with ""1984 was a warning not a guide book"""
2244,"No, that's what Reddit wants.

If they ever ban TD, we all need to stay on Reddit and just shitpost all over every other subreddit. They want us contained here as much as possible. 

Ill be dropping low-key redpills all day over other subreddits if they ban TD. I jus lt casually browse TD mostly, but I'd be motivated so much more of they ban TD"
2245,"""If you want to find out who rules over you, find those who you cannot criticize """
2246,"Yep, this is the power move that needs to be played"
2247,"Tried it briefly. That place is full of Toxic Leftist LoL

But be willing to try it again. 

We don‚Äôt have a public voce here anymore. And dotwin is an echo chamber as well."

2257,"Reddit admins removed half the Donalds mods.

Now that we really have no mods they had to put it on restricted mode otherwise more BS posts would have gotten through and they'd have an excuse to ban the sub.  Only mods and a few users can post new threads."

2273,"The leftover mods design is to push everyone over to .win

All the mods that were pushing to fight the quarantine were de-modded leaving on the pro .win mods. The mods we have now have locked everything due to lack of man power but have not tried recruiting new T_D friendly mods that would allow this place to resume functioning."
2274,"bruh there are real socialist countries out there that have been evil, take Cuba for example, but its evil was authoritarianism, not necessarily socialism. Cuba had a large private sector workforce and had social programs, two actual signs of a country being socialist, and was thus real socialism."
2275,"Another day another reminder: I encourage everyone to go to the App Store and write a 1 star review describing what reddit has done.

Reddit, you should be ashamed by the actions you have taken. I know I am ashamed to be a on this platform.

That is all. Reddit as always, suck a prostate, and feel free to lock this post."
2276,"They use something called masstagger to track anyone that posts in the Donald.

It's like a little gold star next to someone's name that shows up if you comment outside of here."
2277,Good point!!!!!!!
2278,How do you steal people's wealth without being an authoritarian?
2279,"That's shameful.

Luckily, I don't post or comment anywhere where there's insane progressives. At least, not often enough.

As lame as that sounds, that's pretty much the approach I've taken since I subbed here. Because I didn't want to draw the attention of *you-know-who*."
2280,"*Rules for thee, not for me*"
2281,"Or for the SC primary last and most certainly Super Tuesday this week. Biggest week in the race so far, and the mods decision to try to force a move to a tiny dead forum couldn't appear more retarded."
2282,All of this censorship is just further proof of what we‚Äôve known for a while - the leftist elite are scared of any thought that deviates from their desires. They fear our memes and our shitposting because it causes others to rethink their allegiance to the elite. They fear our thoughts and opinions because they can‚Äôt control them.
2283,Can I comment??

2287,At least someone remembered. :(
2288,This sub is quarantined so who are we reaching?
2289,Something stopping you from posting or commenting elsewhere?
2290,"Why the hell was there no live thread for the SC primary last night at the new site? None here either obviously, and most certainly for Super Tuesday this week. Biggest few days in so far in a race for the future of our country and the mods decision to try to force a move to a tiny dead forum couldn't appear more retarded. 

The excuse that's it's just impossible to open the sub doesn't really make sense now, let alone when talking about live threads. Tell me how we would lose control or be false flagged or whatever in a single live thread??"
2291,"TD is dead.

Good job cuck admins. You sure showed us who is boss of this website.

2297,"Taxes are the price we pay for existing inside of a society. If the taxes are being spent for the sake of a society and one is free to leave said society, then having more or less taxes doesn't determine if taxation is theft. Bernie Sanders proposes that additional taxes be paid in order to establish programs that are for the betterment of society at large through the same means that Trump collects taxes for his purposes. Because I personally disagree with the wall, am I correct in saying that my tax dollars going towards it are theft? Of course not..."
2298,Same thing with mine. The other two warnings had no links.
2299,It‚Äôs the new norm for us unfortunately. We all know that‚Äôll never go away.
2300,Pathetic they claim it was attacks on police that earned this sub a quarantine. How many places on Reddit can you name that are as pro police as T_D?
2301,All sick with Covid-19 no doubt. No sitting President has ever lost an election on an economic upswing. In marches a virus and of course CNN is claiming an economic disaster is imminent. Iran of course is super chummy with Central America.
2302,"the wall just got 10ft taller!!!!!

your soylent pills are weak."
2303,Trump actually likes Bernie. He may not agree with 90% of Bernies politics but they do agree on Trade and shaking up the establishment.
2304,I can't even submist posts here. Fucking cuck mods hard at work silencing members.

2307,mods = mads
2308,"The wall is being funded with military funds.

Your ""social programs"" are taking from the responsible to give to the irresponsible.

The wall uses funds from the responsible to protect the responsible.

The ""everything paid for by taxes is socialism"" argument is tired already.  One is building things to protect citizens who contribute.

The other is simply redistributing their wealth to those who think they deserve it.

If you want health care, then prioritize health insurance over other things.  I shouldn't have to pay for your useless degree."
2309,"yep. total bullshit. and today is trump weekly ""twitter on blast!"" sunday."
2310,The politics sub is a dumpster fire of epic proportions...
2311,"there are thousands of new subs a week on the regular. people know, peole hear, people read...then they seek out and find t_d."
2312,"I called you a cuck because you think appeasing others is more important than upholding values. Letting your religion get fucked while you watch. It's ""*our*"" religion after all, can't be stingy.

&gt;Its not all or nothing.

&gt;We strive for perfection

Mutually exclusive. A thot flaunting her body shares the exact same purpose as porn.

&gt;The difference between us is, you actually think youre perfect.  

Nope, that's just the strawman you keep using to distract from how you literally don't strive for or even believe in the Christian standard of perfection."
2313,Didn't Jim Jordan touch little boys?
2314,What determines if a person contributes?
2315,"Yeah, this is not a good hill to die on. Let us post shit , at least a stickies discussion thread. This can take wind out of trumps sails at a time we can‚Äôt afford for that to happen. Is there an alternative on reddit? Donald.win isn‚Äôt even fucking working"
2316,Mods locked it.
2317,I still have yet to get that upvote warning did they stop?
2318,I'm not sure of the process to whitelist people but it looks like the mods will keep the subreddit in this state until something happens with the admins.

You don't understand *how* to fight these assholes. First of all, delete everything you posted or submitted here. Give them nothing, no ability to make money from your words or to use them against you.

Make alts, if you are so late to the game that you don't have a platoon ready to go. Infiltrate. Agree with basic premises in main reddit subs, then introduce subtle narrative shifts by being the ""reasonable, moderate"" voice. Be patient. Give away nothing personal. Assume another identity.

Use other alts to shove red pills up their collective anuses. Use their own tactics against them. If you have prepared, they can never get rid of you without killing themselves."

With the lawyers Reddit can afford and the political connections they have TD.win would be shut down immediately for IP theft if they really wanted to do it. 

Does anyone believe that Reddit would just sit back and allow their code and their design to be ported practically verbatim by a competitor while that competitor is advertising openly on Reddit to steal traffic and redirect people to their knock-off site? Fuck no they wouldn't, unless they were in on it.

.Win will NEVER have the reach that this sub has. It's impossible and they know the community would be far less effective at .win even if all 8 million users went there permanently.

I've been watching the last 4 years unfold. I've been exposed to the 24/7 bullshit criticism, I've had real life friends fuck me over because they can't separate themselves from the insanity and treat us poorly because of only a few small differences in opinion. I've watched as both of us have reaped the rewards of a better economy. I've always been open to ideas from both sides. However, there is only 1 side that has been attempting to stifle every voice, including many that were once on their side. The new left. 

This is what it has become. They are the hypocritical authoritarians. They are the Fascists. Trump may be the biggest egotistical asshole ever to hold the office, and I say... GOOD. Fuck 'em. I hope the game only gets bigger. I hope Trump steamrolls them '84 style.

That's not even the point of the_donald. It's primary purpose is literally to be a non-stop rally for Trump supporters only. The fact that any nonsupporters ever saw us was despite Reddit and it's efforts to censor and quarantine is, not because of Reddit. And those who were not ideologically entrenched were few and far between compared to all the die hard ideologues who wanted only to show us hatred. I'm glad people who think like you weren't the ones who started the_donald to begin with, or else our community never would have come together and would have remained a diaspora of individuals convinced of their solitude in a sea of leftist vomit.

Just to spell it out for you because you seem slow.  It's a metaphor. Reddit is the British, WIN is the United States and you are the cuck. 


I refuse to believe anyone can be dumb enough to think that opening The Donald back up and trying to continue to please Reddits arbitrary rules is a good idea. You can't surely be that dumb. 



You're either incredibly slow and I feel sorry for you or you want to see Trumps base with the rug pulled out from underneath right when it's politically most damaging. 



I don't know enough about individual mods and mod drama but at this point I'm pretty comfortable just going the opposite direction of whatever you think. 


""The more heavy handed..."" Ahh yes the Canada ""if I fight back my enemy wins"" cuck stance. You indeed are a true cuck. Congratulations. 


The Donald has been quarantined for so long now, no one is seeing anything there's nothing remotely ""public forum"" related about The Donald anymore. It's not a battle ground. Spez and Co have done their best to ensure people from The Donald (1) stay in the Donald and (2) are never seen. In fact, the threat of further restrictions on The Donald was used by Reddit to stop people from The Donald joining the public discourse in the rest of the site. 


So genius, how does The Donald fit into your  plan to win over the hearts and minds if we're always hidden away and restricted from joining discussions other people might see under threat of further restrictions to The Donald?


.... if only there was a site Reddit admins didn't control and that Reddit couldn't apply restrictions to in order to suppress Trump supporters  


You don't even know who you're angry at.You just want to stay on Reddit. I know. Independence is scary. Thinking for yourself is scary. 


The good news is the atmosphere on WIN is great! 


Going through you profile I had hoped to find something that would prove me wrong. Unfortunately, all it did was confirm that you're a low IQ individual. Why do all shills have 6 or 7yr old accounts with such few upvotes?


Also, afaik the Q rule was applied by Reddit and doesn't seem to apply on WIN. Funny how that works. It's almost like being away from Reddit let's people talk more freely. 


Ok. If it had no impact, then why do you care? Why do you care about the ""battle ground of a public forum"" and helping people Bernie bros see if it happened to TD it could happen to them? 


Lol you've got no idea. Reddit wanted us here. They wanted us contained and controlled. The community leaving to WIN this early represents a massive blunder on their part. They wanted morons like you here being slow boiled until just before the election when they delete the place. 


You think Reddit cares about what people think about deleting the Donald? Hahaha you are even dumber than I thought. They're activists. They'll burn their entire business to the ground if it means helping their cause and hurting Trump.

2551,Mods restricted submissions not Reddit. They should‚Äôve add more trusted people to the submitter lists. But they didn‚Äôt. They just want all traffic to go the new site. They‚Äôre even locking threads.
2552,So free speech only on your terms then? Got it.
2553,All the left over mods seem to care about now is driving traffic from here to the new site.
2554,He won‚Äôt. He is just pandering for views.
2555,"This subreddit explicitly states it‚Äôs a Trump Supporters only forum. If you wish to debate supporters of the president or criticize his policies, we ask that you take that to the Ask The Donald subreddit. However, far too many people can‚Äôt understand that and have too much hate for the president and his supporters to understand why they have their own Trump supporters only space."
2556,Tim pool reminds me of a lefty that‚Äôs pro choice because he‚Äôs afraid a woman won‚Äôt touch his pp if they think he‚Äôs pro life.
2557,What's going on with this sub now? No new posts at all really aside from a few. Are they being deleted by mods or is everyone migrated over to that new site?
2558,We went from Legion of Doom to this.
2559,"Hey Frens, why are you posting here and giving them salty pepe tears when you could be posting on thedonald.win? There is no 1st amendment protection for forums but thedonald.win guarantees it."
2560,"Another example of your party making up things to go with your narrative, this is communism.

Reddit has always been a agragator for interests, with various forums for various interests.  Reddit has never been a business, based on these changes it looks like they've become one though."
2561,So is this sub effectively dead now? There doesn't seem to be any new posts popping up.
2562,Testing
2563,If that doesn't show the importance of the 2nd amendment I do t know what does.

2572,Reddit is controlling who becomes new mods now. Any new mods to help remaining TD mods are guaranteed to be commies. The sub is dead.

2576,Well it was a good run.
2577,Reddit is dead to me now.  No posts on td means i come here less
2578,"Reddit isn't accountable to anything really they can do what they want, I'm willing to bet that even if they didn't give these fake ass reasons for the quarantine and jihad against TD people still wouldn't have a problem with them doing whatever they want to us. They will never answer honestly because they know if they admit it it will be bad, everyone on this neckbeard site already knows in their heart we're being wronged."

2583,Reminder that China provided a full **FIFTY PERCENT** of Reddit's funding in 2019. Of course they would make reddit remove anti-Chinese politics.
2584,Kinda scary how 1984 and Idiocracy are becoming reality.
2585,A puppy sub would probably remove trolls posting things against puppies or spamming about kittens too.  Would that upset you?
2586,"Urine inside the bladder with no infections is very clean, barring a few issues.  (No, it's not sterile: it just doesn't have much \*bad\* bacteria.)  The urethra, particularly towards the end, is not sterile, and that bacteria is often pretty nasty.  Many doctors even recommend going a little bit before giving the UTI test sample to help flush to get a more accurate bacterial count of inside the bladder.

So, in conclusion, skank third world prostitute piss is about as far as you can get from ""sterile.""  Shocking, I know."

2592,I up-voted and 5 minutes later there was a black sedan parked across the street.
2593,Sure but pedes here trashed the place and posted illegal stuff. Are consequences bad now? We are law &amp; order which applies to the bad bad pedes here too.
2594,No. He got shot while buying a motorcycle a couple days before a charity event he was going to attend

2602,A free market enterprise.
2603,"LOL  We'll ignore the fact that there's no fucking law protecting anyone from talking about whistleblowers,  but how can we post the name of the whisteblower when no one knows who he is?    I mean, officially on record, we are told that no one knows his identity.  LOL  

News outlets can report it.  Adam Schiff can put it in an official government document on record, but we can't post those things here?      Be a better troll.  You suck at it.

it's because MEMES CHANGE MINDS.

and we're too good at it. all you guys. you're amazing. look what they've done to you. you cut into their owner's agenda SO WELL that you can't be allowed to participate here."
2608,Where's all the posts ? There used to be hundreds a day.
2609,No it doesn't.
2610,"I am a lawyer and can confirm that the law simply doesn‚Äôt account for this exact situation. Technically reddit is not a state actor, but social media platforms are unique and haven‚Äôt really been addressed in the courts‚Äî so it‚Äôs a risky endeavor. [This article does a good job summarizing the issue.](https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/social-clashes-digital-free-speech) 

I keep thinking of the numerous conservative U.S. ‚Äúlegal defense fund‚Äù organizations that jump at the chance to represent people in ideologically important cases. Tom Fitton‚Äôs Judicial Watch is an example. I would imagine if he thought there was *any* chance of success in the courts here, he‚Äôd be filing that lawsuit himself. Hey; maybe he‚Äôs working on right now, who knows? Maybe if some of us PM him about it he‚Äôll consider it if he hasn‚Äôt already. 

The Alliance Defending Freedom is probably the most influential legal defense fund of all. I have worked with them for years, although they are extremely picky on the cases they take. But maybe I can at least get a contact on someone likeminded who does federal cases on this issue. You know, it never hurts to just call a lawyer and ask. The vast majority don‚Äôt charge anything for consultation and will give you free advice even if they don‚Äôt take the case."

2614,Ahhhhh yes your treatments are working as planned. Just wait until your next lesson about why you should give up all of your worldly possessions to support the lazy and ignorant. You will start waking up in a cold sweat cursing the billionaire class.
2615,I'd definitely download if that were the case
2616,Hell no. It might be the very last comment I can ever respond to here.
2617,"They aren't even posting Trump tweets anymore. They've killed this forum and are hoping we all forget about it. Go break the quarantine and start posting elsewhere, even if you get downvoted."
2618,Thedonald.lose is slow as shit and the format sucks.  Stay here and fight this ban instead of running away like little bitches
2619,"Keep following your script it's all you have really. Your handlers prob won't like your erratic logic of ""we don't know his name"" and ""so what if we posted it"". It just makes you look like a bad version of a useful idiot."
2620,I heard a commercial on the radio this morning reminding me to wash my hands before and after preparing food while it mentioned the coronavirus multiple times. Also had some weird eerie music in the background. Wtf is going on...
2621,"I really want to like Tim Pool, but I find his podcasts painful to listen to. He has an unfortunate habit of steering every conversation into being about himself or his interpretation of something instead of engaging with his guests' opinion. Also, he frequently says stuff like, ""I don't want to be someone who does X, but...."", and then he goes and does X. Plus, I'm not sure what insight he really brings to topics other than just being a guy who likes to think and talk about political stuff. Not trying to hate on the guy himself, but I think he could really improve the quality of his product if he took some feedback on it."
2622,I see no harm in them dressing up. If you watch the video they state they aren‚Äôt for the sicko stuff like teaching kids to twerk and they‚Äôre not gay. They do it because they like to.

2624,Jeb is a mess.
2625,"If you watch the video they say they aren‚Äôt gay, they aren‚Äôt trans. They just like to dress up in drag. They are against teaching children to twerk and all that sick stuff. They‚Äôre a fairly interesting person who supports Trump 100%."
2626,"If you watch it, they say they aren‚Äôt gay, aren‚Äôt a tranny, are against twerking for kids and teaching them too. They just like dressing up in drag and they love trump."

2630,LOL. What a noob.
2631,"What did we say about Tim Pool?

The longest red-pilling ever?"
2632,This is so frustrating. They just rolled over and died. Admins claimed they would pick someone after 48 hours and here we sit with a dead site. Tried the new website but it lacks so wealth of information we used to get here due to a lack of user base. The part that was so great about T_D was the ability for others not in our ballpark to wander in over here and have the chance to be redpilled. The admins pulled the plug and the top dogs just rolled over and even added to the insanity by restricting the website which helped completely silence the sub. The big names in the world have turned a blind eye so far and have yet to speak out publicly about it. It‚Äôs all so sad and extremely frustrating. Daily this place would be a collection of ammunition to use in counter arguments against the left and info to teach others who aren‚Äôt sure what is going on. Everyday that goes by I‚Äôm waiting for an announcement or something here from someone ‚Äúofficial‚Äù but instead less and less are even coming here. I frequent the new site as a substitute but website infrastructure has long load times and the amount/quality of content is reminiscent of a knock-off. I‚Äôm giving both these locations more time (because what else can we do) but this slow bleed is going to continue until there is no resemblance of what was.
2633,"I take comfort in knowing that, all those who sit by and say nothing about the biased censorship of anyone they disagree with, will one day be the target of such blatant biased censorship, and the Bernie bros will learn soon enough , why they should be outraged at what has been to the Donald"
2634,And half of Reddit is fine with it
2635,He is just in denial.
2636,I don't think they gave up as much as reddit straight up blocked them and replaced them so don't believe they really had a choice in the matter. It's unfortunate üòî

I‚Äôm not a big fan of the new site at all.. I wish I liked it more but it‚Äôs hard to get used to."
2643,"The sub has been under quarantine for quite a while, people could only come here intentionally. Ripping out the tongue of a person who is already mute is the work of scared bullies."

2648,What do you expect from a milk-toast fence sitter?
2649,Haha!
2650,But CTR/Shareblue/American Independent (all the same) is still running rampant on Reddit. It is pure political propaganda and lies. Look how many American Independent articles are used a sources on redacted.
2651,Thats some mormon magic underwear stuff right there.
2652,"So...TD is pretty much dead now?  The front page has been the same for what, almost a week now?

I remember when this place had a couple thousand. What a cheap ass way to kill TD."
2653,Most likely they are actually goats.
2654,The mods that hijacked this subreddit and are demanding our immigration to .win are cowards.  Retreating and committing suicide are not our values.  Open the subreddit back up and let the admins kill us off one by one.  If our numbers are true we should take over redacted if/when the admins shut this down.
2655,"Check this out: https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Congress/comments/df487p/demodding_and_the_motivation_behind_it/

2658,"In order to start a cult, first you have to be charismatic.  Next, you have to get the virile men on board.  Whats on every guy‚Äôs mind, pussy. It makes total sense, especially if the demographic is uneducated and sub 80 IQ.   Finally, bag all the women from head to toe, this does two things.  It dehumanizes them, and you can‚Äôt see  the goods, so they are reduced to a powerful fantasy, instead of the flawed creatures that we all are.  

Its really brilliant, and although each cult is different, they all do this in some way.  Koresh, hubbard, smith, etc."
2659,"I post here, but I also try to post in the wild as much as possible. It is best to make sure your comment is solid and well written, and then leave. The more you engage, argue, and defend your original comment, the more likely someone will report you and your comments will be removed or shadowbanned.  

You don‚Äôt have to have an audience of millions, or even thousands. It‚Äôs enough to plant a tiny seed in even just one or two people‚Äôs minds to pique their interest and get them started. You aren‚Äôt posting for the people who have serious TDS, or who will argue or engage with you. Most have ulterior motives, or are a lost cause. Post for the lurkers who are on the fence. You may never think or know that you are making a difference, but you are."
2660,"&gt; There are a lot of us out there.

There are a lot of you in here too.   Source: One of them.  I still hold many liberal ideals, however Trump somehow made me cherish conservative values without compromising my prior beliefs."
2661,"&gt; What I cannot support is the intentional and planned destruction of this site by mods in cahoots with admins to do it. 

That's funny. I read the same stuff you did and I see no intentional or planned destruction. Neither you nor I know the whole story. What we can observe is 18 months of attempting to follow ever-shifting and more oppressive ""rules"" by an organization that wants us to die. I detest the anti-conservative bullshit that reddit thrives on. I see no point in blaming the mod team or individual mods, they fought a battle that was impossible to win. I've walked a mile in their shoes. I understand strong personalities with a taste of power going at each other and tearing a forum apart, sometimes over the most petty stuff. In my opinion, this was inevitable given the average age of the moderators and the enormous amount of stress moderating this forum surely generates.

Now we have a site that is in the control of conservatives. I'm happy about that. I'm also a Saxon who has begun to hate, as far as reddit as a whole is concerned. This will never be over for me."
2662,"Well yeah, bernie tried a commune, got booted because he was lazy, then spent his honeymoon going to check out the real thing.  

But yeah, we‚Äôve allowed, communists and muslims to infiltrate all levels of govt, right down to local school boards. They were bragging that bernie has the highest support from college graduates.  Well duh, his whole platform is loan forgiveness, not to mention that colleges have been brainwashing kids for 50 years or more.  

I jad a greek econ professor convince me that buying american was counterproductive to americans.  His argument was that as blue collar jobs went overseas, that would free up americans to take up even higher paying white collar jobs.  How‚Äôd that work out?"
2663,Morning everyone.
2664,Unpopular opinion but a year ago the knee should never have been bent for the Reddit admins. You should have immediately punched back then and never accepted the quarantine.
2665,Why is this the newest post on TD? It's over 23 hours old. I'm confused.
2666,I‚Äôd rather listen to the Great Cornholio speak.

As I said, it flies right over your head. I'm not asking respectfully for them to consider their positions, I am attempting to move the Overton window without being detected. Banhammer red pilling is just a form of stress relief aimed at the unreachable.

You have a lot of hubris calling me a pussy when you admit to being Spez's cuckold.

Enjoy the rest of your limited time here. I'm never leaving reddit either, particularly when this sub is shut down - whether the communist cannibal cuck Spez likes it or not."

2678,"You put on an amazing mental gymnastics floor routine, y'know that?

On top of that, I worry about your understanding of the Revolutionary war. The Founding Fathers fought for America. They didn't just let England have it while moving everyone to Canada. They weren't even trying to actively be a part of England... it was about standing your ground and saying Fuck The King/Spez.

No one on Earth thinks we can please Reddit and that's not what the non-cucked are calling for. Unlike you, we're not content with giving them a .win and crawling into a hole. You have fun with that.

I get that your pea brain can't see past the immediate nor plan for a future, but pissing in Reddit's eye is a suprior tactic than fucking off to a private circle jerk. If you think that's about ""Returning"" then you're being willfully ignorant, but then again you've been willfully twisting everything for the duration of this as it is.

As for the ""mod drama"", as y'all like to downplay it: Again, the atmosphere is gone because the people who want to capture the user base have locked the sub down... yet you wanna pretend that it just sorta happened? Come the fuck on. A back-up is one thing, but when the people who run the back-up block people from posting on the main board, then y'got a problem.

As for Q, the mods are Anti-Q, just like the ones before them. It's like how Q people aren't down with Alex Jones. Essentially its: ""It's enough of a pain in the ass to be a Trump supporter without also having people go after me for Q!"" and ""It's hard enough being a Trump/Q supporter, we don't need association with folks like Jonesie!"". Plus they were still on that Anti-Q kick in the Discord, where Reddit doesn't make the rules.

The_Donald had an impact back in 2016, no doubt. But Trump has been turning Democrats into folks who #WalkAway since then. One of the main things that get people to #WalkAway is SEEING how shitty their side is. Get 'em to that ""This isn't right and I can no longer stand with this"" phase of their escaping the Democrat Plantation. And we need to help the Bernie Bros. They're Americans also who will need to be given reasons not to still vote for the DNC candidate like they did in 2016. I doubt someone as asinine as you can grasp that, though.

If Reddit didn't care what people thought about them deleting The Donald, it would have been done already. They wouldn't have tried to quietly ramp things up over and over again. The fact that we're having this conversation here shows that they care. Not about us... but about their protections under the law and the appearance of operating in good faith for those who don't come here for The Donald.

You go have fun in your little play house. We adults who can see beyond Reddit through to the bigger picture are going to continue to hold the line and fight these sick people. And for fuck sake, have someone help you with your Revolutionary War analogy before you take another crack at it because you are just nooooot doing well with the concept."

2680,"Yes, tax away half their wealth, they'll be fine.  Then you need to lower the threshold for who gets taxed because you still need that revenue stream and tax all that wealth away.

Then you need to lower the threshold for who gets taxed because you still need that revenue stream and tax all that wealth away.

2704,A vile traitor to truth and freedom.
2705," Admins suck.. But here is the real intent of the MODS

* Make it so that T\_D is unusable.
* Create a site, on a completely different website, for T\_D users. Because it's a different website, T\_D users will be completely isolated, so their content will not seep out to other subs on reddit. Also, since all the T\_D users will be on this other website, that means they will be spending less time on reddit - and less time shitposting and redpilling other subs.

2707,Happy Cake Day!
2708,Mods are asleep.
2709,TY ‚ô•Ô∏è
2710,Yeah it's pretty easy to figure out their play here. China hates donald trump so I'm sure our buddies the chinese investors had a lot to demand when it came to this sub. I don't know if we just go to ask the donald or somewhere else? [td.win](https://td.win) isn't really that great - you can't find out the context of comment replies and it's shit on mobile.
2711,I see you.
2712,When they cannot win on the basis of their own arguments they have to ‚Äòwin‚Äô by using intimidation and censorship.
2713,!remind me in 72 hours

2715,Well somebody's still posting here!
2716,According to liberal interpretation of the civil rights act for equal access the admins of reddit are required to bake us a MAGA cake whether they agree with it or not.
2717,"&gt; Yes, tax away half their wealth, they'll be fine.

They sure will.

&gt; Then you need to lower the threshold for who gets taxed because you still need that revenue stream.

Do you?

&gt;Tax All their wealth away.

ALL you say?

Are you a billionaire or something?   You are acting like taxing Billionaires is the same thing as destroying everyone in the nations wealth."
2718,"Like I was saying the other day, this is like the beginning of some dystopian nightmare.  

That's the worst part -- censorship like this is only the *beginning*.  Holy shit."

2730,Slightly obtuse usage of meme but +1 nonetheless.
2731,"&gt; Are you a billionaire or something? You are acting like taxing Billionaires is the same thing as destroying everyone in the nations wealth.

Because once you tax everyone below the threshold where wealth is taxed, you don't think they will lower the threshold to maintain that revenue stream?  How far do they need to lower it before they take your pension, or you have to sell your house to pay the tax?  Do you honestly believe this will only effect billionaires?"
2732,"Lol fuck you dude. That simple, bullshit statement you just made tells me you dont belong anywhere near t_d"

2736,"&gt;Because once you tax everyone below the threshold where wealth is taxed, you don't think they will lower the threshold to maintain that revenue stream? 

No.

&gt; How far do they need to lower it before they take your pension, or you have to sell your house to pay the tax?

They won't.  See above.

&gt;Do you honestly believe this will only effect billionaires?  

Yes."
2737,"SAD.

i haven't seen and ultra rare pepe in days."
2738,"Clearly you don't understand how the world works, money, or business.  A billionaire's wealth is not cash.  It's capital assets tied up in businesses or stocks.   To tax that, you have to liquidate it or just transfer ownership to the govt.  

Let's take Warren Buffet as an example.   If you seized half of his wealth, you'd be seizing half the companies on this page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_Berkshire_Hathaway

They're employees would then be govt employees.  The politician would try to control everything they did and those companies would perform about as well as the Dem Iowa Caucuses did this year.  Millions of jobs would be lost.  

And the govt couldn't sell those companies to get cash, because you seized the cash of anyone that might have been able to buy it. 

The reality that you didn't take the time to think about is that the jobs of most people come from people that are wealthier than they are."
2739,Is sub dead?
2740,It really was.  It was a LOT longer than I thought it would be.  I‚Äôm not going to unsubscribe from here but I don‚Äôt think the powers-that-be will ever allow this place to thrive again.

Don't make me go look up how the actual Sander's proposal works FFS.  We are not actually talking about taxing half of wealth away at all.  

I am being facetious about the ""half"" thing.  

BTW, I can still be a capitalist and think taxing Billionaires more is a good idea.  Go ahead and put money back into the American economy.  The wealthy will still be wealthy, and everyone else will have more money to spend on everything else.  It's sound economic practice."
2760,Wow.  It appears as if Reddit has completely killed the Donald.  No posts.  No new content.    Its a pretty sad day when the media companies are trying to effect the outcome of the election.

2786,"&gt; It's not often, if ever, I speak out against the mods here.
&gt; 
&gt; But this.
&gt; 
&gt; This is exactly what the admins wanted. This is exactly what the admins have dreamed about. There's less than 3000 people on this sub right now, which is as low as i can remember it's ever been. And the admins didn't have to do a damn thing. You mods have basically self-banned this sub. I don't buy the ""we don't have enough mods"" line, you still have plenty.
&gt; 
&gt; Open this place back up. If we get banned, we get banned. But that's no different than what we have now. I'm banned from the sub I love. I can't post. No one else can post. Only mods and a handful of select people can post.
&gt; 
&gt; I get you want to push to .win. But .win does nothing. No one sees .win. It's just this sub with a different web address.
&gt; 
&gt; If T_D is to end, let it end by our own hand. But the current situation is untenable. It looks more and more like a cash grab, trying to force traffic to another site. And don't get me wrong, I love cash grabs. I hope .win gets monetized. But not at the cost of this sub.

Whether it is ""right"" doesn't mean taxing them won't fund the programs he is trying to fund, and it doesn't mean it's some slippery slope to the ""99 percent"" being taxed at the same rate, as some are arguing.

What would be a problem, IMO is the effect on the health care industry itself.  And of course, the rebellion that would occur via many very wealthy and powerful people with their fingers in all the pies.

The difference with healthcare is that the cost of healthcare in the United States is unbelievably high and many people can not afford the life saving care that they need.  People shouldn‚Äôt die for being poor.  I don‚Äôt think the government should provide everything for everyone.  I think it needs to make healthcare more affordable at the very least.  Capitalism is not a perfect system.  The government has had to step in numerous times in history when companies began to take advantage of people.  We did not suddenly devolve into a socialist or communist country when that happened.  Companies are once again greatly taking advantage of people, why can‚Äôt the government help with that?"
2883,"I was listening to somebody talk about this recently, and they were talking about how Marxism failed in the previous generation because they focused on class, and the working class ultimately rejected the idea of Marxism. Now the focus has been put on race, gender, etc or immutable characteristics. It's obviously been wildly successful and literally a cult/ religion has been birthed that has taken over way too many institutions and will probably get worse. 

The most ironic part about all of this is the fact that most of the problems the woke intersectionalists focus on, would be solved if they focused on class and not race.

Which proves the point they aren't looking to make the world a better place, they're just looking for power."

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJsC-buIkSE&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJsC-buIkSE&amp;feature=youtu.be) 

I don't find it gives any info that wasn't already widely known:

Patton didn't die due to a car accident according to the official story

JFK wasn't killed by a lone gunman, MLK's story is also false as is Malcom X's

Seth Rich

Epstein didn't kill himself

The pattern is so long and well established that it almost make Hillary Clinton seem to not be at the root of it. Almost. Anyway, Patton was an extremely interesting figure, that every American should be familiar with. His conflict with General then President Eisenhower is a huge part of US history that has EVERYTHING to do with our struggles now. Had Ike listened to Patton, McCarthy would've had nothing to worry about and the Sanders / AOC wing of the Democrat party would not exist."

""Bread lines are a good thing"" - Bernie Sanders, who also honeymooned in the USSR while saying that countries like Cuba and Venezuela are socialist utopia. USSR slaughtered millions of it's own people for wrong think, worked millions of people to death, and sentenced people to gulags.

In parts of America right this second there are more jobs than people in that town. Towns are getting new factories, thanks to Trump. Those towns are not poor. They have very low homeless rates, and the homeless in those town refuse to take the jobs that are readily available. There is no housing for the poor in San Francisco, which has some of the most expensive housing in America. There are no jobs for the poor in San Francisco which has a $15 dollar minimum wage. The socialist ideals of comrade Sanders has lead to human beings shitting on the streets in San Francisco, which has a much larger blanket health insurance program, MediCal, that has not fixed any of the problems of the big cities.

3084,"The dip was caused by Sander's winning Nevada, the rebound was caused by deep state Biden killing it in South Carolina. It looks like Biden has a clear lock on the south, and may get plenty of votes. The market is more afraid of a communist coming in and taxing corporations, and billionaires than it has ever been of anything in our history. If you had a billion dollars, and someone said they were going to stop you from being able to be a billionaire, and that person was also gaining momentum and could become the democratic candidate, wouldn't you sell off some stocks, and invest in gold, just in case? Well, that is exactly what they did. Biden may be a deep state rat, but the deep state never tried to stop a billionaire from being a billionaire. We can hope for a contested convention now, it looks like a possibility. At minimum, Biden is going to be running until the last vote is counted, his life is at stake so that he doesn't get caught for his dealings in Ukraine.

To add- Biden has a clear advantage in the south. Even if Bernie gets the majority, Biden may be able to gain enough delegates from fly over states,and the south alone to propel him to a contested convention, and a super delegate win for him. He actually stands a chance, which is crazy, considering how crazy he is. People are actually out voting for sleepy Joe over Comrade Bernie just because they hate communism. Good job sleepy Joe, I guess. LOL"

Oh wait. We‚Äôre talking about a shortage of posts at T_D. Sorry, got carried away there."
3186,Seriously. Fuck this cesspool of a site. It has officially become an echo chamber of left wing thought. Now there are no major subreddits to see the rights point of view.
3187,"&gt; The last point is the most ludicrous. Anybody going into the default subs throwing non-leftist opinions around eventually gets banned. The rest of reddit hates conservatives by default, there's no point going to other subs in an effort to convince anybody. When was the last time a stranger got you to change your values over the internet? It just doesn't happen.

I'm sure, as a 10-yr user, you'll agree with me when I say that we drop red-pills in the default subs for the thousands of lurkers, not the few commie shills that respond to you.   I think this part is why we NEED to stay here.  Strangers absolutely get others to change their values over the internet whether you see it happen or not.   I'm sure in 2016, that exact thing happened en masse to Bernie Supporters realizing untruths they were told about Trump.  I was one of them - it took Veritas for it to click with me.   Tell me what subs would post Veritas videos if not for TD.  Veritas wouldn't be able to do what they do without us in the initial stages."
3188,"I didn't say the mod who restricted the sub ""quarantined"" the sub.  I understand the difference. 

The mod who created a private site (Win) restricted posting on (T_D).  There's kind of a conflict of interest there which can't be denied."

3198,We can use Tom's posts as a vessel to keep the sub alive.
3199,Hi Tom. There's an echo in here now.
3200,Can everyone just send your posts to Tom Fitton and see if he will post them for you under his name?   I mean really.  What else are we supposed to do?  Spell correct is a pain sometimes......
3201,"T\_D is not an echo chamber.  If it were, there would have been no need to quarantine and attack it like they have.  I'm sure it was in the beginning, but the size of it is a danger to left think.  Curious people come all the time.

3203,That sucks
3204,Being able to tell people in other subs to come to T_D and participate.  This is a community site.  You need to be able to communicate.  There are plenty of good pedes who want to mod.

3206,"I've read it would be banned immediately for evading a quarantine.  I've found lots of pedes on Drain the Swamp, The Congress, and The Watch today.

3209,"&gt; .win is not the same... Fucking not even close.

You're right.

**It's MUCH BETTER.**

Why are you so eager to hang on to Reddit who clearly fights your interests?"
3210,So all that‚Äôs left on this sub is Fitton posts? And it‚Äôs the same old shit about Hillary that has never gone anywhere? Reddit really fucked this place up.
3211,"You may be surprised to know that not too too long ago, Reddit was open-source, so the format could easily be replicated, at the very least from an older code. I would guess one of the main reasons they aren't anymore is because they started unfairly fucking with the formulas because of the_donald and they didn't want people to see what they were doing. 

The mods are shutting down T_D (well, 99%, anyway) because our content is now being moderated by ADMINS, NOT the mods. 

What would the motive be of the mods to migrate? There are no ads on TD.W, currently. And frankly, it reminds me a hell of a lot more how T_D used to be than it was, even before the lockdown. So, scam or not, we don't really have much of a choice."

It's just too large to ban so they did the sock puppet strategy. But I think you're kidding yourself if you think T_D has some kind of massive influence on the rest of reddit's echo chamber the way this sub has been throttled into oblivion.

Also is there any revenue in hosting the .win website? I see how transferring the users could be a conflict of interest, just not sure how its benefiting the leadership yet."
3287,"I'm sure everyone would. Posters are restricted because the admins anihillated the mod team. Smelling blood the trolls who are constantly trying to take us down redoubled their efforts.

Over two years ago, I had heard about TD, but didn't really want to go there as I never went to Reddit before, and had heard negative things about TD. Once I got there, it was fantastic. Great memes, tons of links to MAGA articles. Positive Pedes posting great comments. It was nothing like what I had heard. 

My point being, many folks may have heard about TD since the quarantine, and may have been scared off just by the quarantine warning alone as well as the negative press. Plus, no posts have propagated to /All or anywhere else for ages.

Why not have a different site that is not run by lefties? If we sell the shit out of it, it can become as good or better than TD ever was. 

I could certainly be wrong, but I don't buy any of the negative conspiracies about the folks that started win. They aren't asking for money. There are no ads. I just don't see the evil master plan. Personally, I think they will eventually do ads or something, to pay for the server load that a million or so shitposters will drive.  And good for them. I even hope they make a fortune.

You want people to have an easier living stop taxing the hell out of everyone.   They get the money, they use the money.  Your way, they pay half or more of the money out in taxes and then you give then whatever freebies you think are appropriate, always less than they would have had if they just kept the money.  Then inevitably someone starts turning the screws and the taxes go higher and the benefits drop and you end up fleeing Venezuela.  This has happened every single time socialist/communist country has been established.  Just because there a couple still in-process doesn't mean they are going to be successful.  

You want to help people out with cost of living, mandate lower taxes.  If you mandate lower taxes for the same amount as any wage increase, we'd all be onboard.

But the mods keep pushing it as if we should all just leave reddit and replace T_D, which is the easiest way to neuter our effectiveness. We‚Äôd be giving reddit exactly what they want. 

Not to mention all the mod drama, which made me skeptical of thedonald.win from the start."
3335,So what?  What does this really mean?  I love JW but their efforts fall on deaf Republican ears.

The mods have been divided for years and there was a fringe group that have been working with the admins for a long time so they can plan out how to silence our community once and for all. I know it sounds crazy, but we here know that these people know how to play the long haul. 

I implore people to look into these rumors. I have the link in my post history. Everytime I post it I think I get shadowbanned. I know 4chan isn't always the greatest, but there are a lot of rumors going on around there.

Edit: seems like even looking into my post history people can't find the link. Shoot me a private message if you want the link. This is very important and we all need to work together(and stick together) to find out the truth"

3354,"Yea, I get it, it sucks and the quarantine was/is obvious bullshit.  And don't get me wrong, I'll be the first to agree that the overall content and quality has decreased over the years.  

But we still had a functioning sub with constant new stickies, good articles, good memes, good conversation.  Now we have almost nothing; I think you over-estimate people's desire to frequent a new, difficult to use platform that is even further separated from the red-pillable masses on Reddit than a quarantined TD is.  

In my honest, humble opinion: .WIN is quite literally a circle-jerk - there is no outside audience, and our ability to gain new support is almost non-existent.  Trump rallies wouldn't be the same if it was all people who 100% supported Trump - we love to see the huge numbers of independents and democrats that attend the rallies.   This sub is, by definition, a non-stop rally for Trump.

I think the mods have done a great job dealing with the Reddit shit: but the transition to .WIN looks to me like they value their positions as leaders of the community more than the prominence of the community itself.  

The rest of the mods should've followed suit when they mass banned mods the other day and gone down in solidarity.  I would be content following that initiative - its more likely for this to make headlines and attract support from allies close to the administration than what is currently being done."
3355,I've been to Win.  It's a nice vacuum if that's what you're looking for.

3366,This sub didnt get locked until reddit admins changed the rules once again to target this sub and banned half the mods overnight. That's what's fishy. They both coexisted fine before that. The other subs popping up on reddit will probably get banned for quarantine evasion soon enough. Dont know why everyone is suspicious of .win when people were asking for it for an alternative forever ago. If you want to stay and be a thorn in reddit's ass then have at it but it doesnt mean the other site cant exist.

3408,"""Let them eat cake!""  We are truly spoiled!"
3409,"&gt; It doesn't sound crazy it's 100% logical. This sub being shut down by the same mods who run TD.win tells you all you need to know. Their excuse is bullshit. They are intentionally trying to drive traffic to .win to get users away from Reddit because an outright ban would almost seal the deal on Reddit losing their special protections as a social square platform.
&gt; 
&gt; Think about it, our own mods locked this place down and have been herding people off Reddit using stickied posts to direct users to a third party website. When does Reddit ever let you advertise for a competing platform without deleting the posts?
&gt; 
&gt; Also think about how Reddit is letting someone host a site that was very likely built using pieces of their own code base and which undeniably uses Reddit's proprietary design format; but Reddit attorneys don't send them a cease and desist letter and shut them down. Why not?
&gt; 
&gt; Also the onslaught of suspicious posts pushing that ""TD.win is our home now"" and encouraging people to abandon this place rather than to stay and fight for the same rights that Reddit affords every other presidential candidate and political figure's subreddit.
&gt; 
&gt; It all stinks like ""Mr. Trump"" back in 2016 where they tried to divide and conquer this sub.
&gt; 
&gt; Same old shit different approach. These mods are not our friends, they have an agenda and it's not to MAGA.

one could agree this is a thoughtful analysis."
3410,"Basically shutting down this sub and shifting people over to .win to weaken and divide us. And then most likely shutting down the new site as well to completely censor this community. I'll send you a link that is pretty astonishing. Apparently mods that have been around for a long time betrayed us and have been working with the admins on this plan.

But don't take it from me. Everyone should research it themselves ofc."

I suspect admins are playing this close to their legal team so they cant be sued as a publisher. They expected us to overreact and give them an excuse to pull the trigger. T_D is effectively muzzled."

Preferably in the form of climate change, but I would take the state puff marshmallow man or whatever Zool wanted to turn into so long as the result was the same."

3453,"You are dead on, and hopefully you get the upvotes for more traction. The way the mods have been behaving is incredibly suspect. The way td.win was pushed while they were restricting content and posting on this sub is what got me and my brothers talking about it. It wasn't until I was invited to a private subreddit and my brother went to 4chan that I really started to suspect there was something seriously off. 

The mods are in positions of power that allow them to manipulate this community and the admins are fully aware of that. This just goes right back to the fact that we can't trust people in positions of power. It's frickin sad as hell, and I hope the people around here look into these rumors, and critically think about this whole situation/affair.

3460,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I fully believe everything alleged in the post. However, the mods don't seem to be doing anything at all to resolve the current state of the sub. Whenever they post here now, it's basically just to drive people to .win. Why isn't there a post about their plan moving forward to combat the reddit situation? It really does look like they've given up and resolved to go quietly into the night. T_D deserves better than that."

3474,Basically reddit cannot put in their mods if there is no need for them. Hopefully the current mods will find some good Maga mods but it seems from what I've read that shadowman is sort of sabotaging the sub. He's the reason the sub is quarantined; he stickied a 'redacted' sub article.

You want to know why i know this is the right move?   Because the left wanted net neutrality bad...  and they wanted it because it would have allowed the government to pressure any ISP to shut down a website that didn't adhere to leftist doctrine.    Their plan was always to shut us down... but they wanted net neutrality to ensure we didn't build our own spaces.     We have the freedom to start our own site... and thats already been done.      Time to go to .win and start anew.   In time we will be much better off there while reddit will die a slow, smothering death of censorship adhering to clown world politics."

You don't have a candidate like that right now.  You underestimate the growth of Trump's appeal over the last few years.  It's grown significantly, while democrat support falters. Just look at the rallies your candidates draw...pitiful numbers.

&gt; how do you think this will turn out against someone people actually like

Easy, far less voter fraud and ballot harvesting from unscupulous democrats and their supporters, means far more Trump supporters will turn out to vote for him than in the last election.  You have **no viable candidate**.  You're hoping for a dream that will not materialize.

The only delusion here is your own."

I hear the argument also that there won‚Äôt be enough mods to manage the postings, and we will be brigaded by trolls seeking to subvert our Dom and/or and get us banned.  To this I again say, force the admins into banning us instead of implementing a self-imposed restriction on postings."

To my pede frenz who condemn Reddit rightfully so, you have your choice to be completely unfettered at www.thedonald.win. I use the site as well and it's nice not being censored.

But some of you have to look at the long game which sometimes you are terrible at. The reddit admins are getting more and more known for being censorious. They have bias, they don't play by the rules. The long /r/the_donald exists with legal mods, it is a thorn in their side but especially so for the users from certain other subreddits. They will scream about how hateful this subreddit is, normies come check it and and you know what, it's not so bad, so they stick around, or subscribe or took 1 simple red pill at least not to listen to Fake news anymore. 

thedonald.win can be a great launching site for news and memes. But if we can't spread that word out anywhere else, we become our own echo chamber, and for that, I thank the mods for fighting the good fight."

3808,"So is Reddit going to give any reason why the previous mods were removed in the first place beyond promoting Wrongthink? 

All of these imaginary hoops and hurdles that have to be made just because dissent against the mainstream narrative exists is truly pathetic.

In all honesty, removing real mods and replacing them with ‚Äúhandpicked‚Äù reddit ones just seems like a cheap way for Reddit to say ‚Äúhey, look these mods aren‚Äôt complying with our rules so we will have to ban the whole sub now!‚Äù These newly offending ‚Äúreddit approved‚Äù mods *totally* weren‚Äôt instructed to do this by outside forces (spez/tencent/political elite) that have been trying every method possible to dismantle this place. 

Previous mods already DID comply with the rules, if they didn‚Äôt then the sub would‚Äôve been banned. Now they are just resorting to planting new people in here because they have nothing left but lying and pretending. Same old censorship, lies, and corruption - the things this sub spent the most time fighting against. That‚Äôs the only real reason why this place has been demonized. 

To leftist lurkers celebrating censorship: If you truly believe the hackneyed ‚Äúracist, sexist, homophobic‚Äù trope about Trump supporters you are wrong; you need to open your eyes, read a book, and *engage* with real people not just believe headlines that profit from your ignorance and emotional volatility.

##‚ÄùKeep an open mind, but not so open that your brain falls out.‚Äù"
3809,"What is restricted mode? Is that why my own personal homepage doesn't show a single post from the Donald, nor does it show up in my own subbed list? Is that why I have to actively search out the sub, which I am already subbed to just to see content?"

3891,Is speaking mandarin a requirement for the new mods?
3892,"This fucking stupid and communistic bullshit. I understand that any social media is a grey area with the 1st Amendment, and as a ""citizen user"" (not an admin), that I'm (we are) in someone else's house (Reddit), but kicking people out of our off of Reddit simply because they don't hold YOUR VIEWS is necrotic and malignant. Hitler said 

&gt;""The best way to take control over a people and control them utterly is to take a little of their freedom at a time, to erode rights by a thousand tiny and almost imperceptible reductions. In this way, the people will not see those rights and freedoms being removed until past the point at which these changes cannot be reversed. -Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf""

3895,"you are correct

*hugs from your frenly neighborhood mod*"
3896,Burn down this subreddit. Fuck anything hosted here. We will never be free as long as we use this platform. thedonald.win
3897,"The admins removed all of the most active mods and even the bots. What did you expect the mods to do? I can understand the argument of letting this place just turn into the cesspool that it would become without moderation so that the admins can finally ban it, but the mods have worked their ass off for years on this sub and don't want to see that happen."
3898,&gt; Please visit https://canary.thedonald.win/ - if that page or this sentence are changed then the Admins have taken over r/The_Donald and silenced our free speech.
3899,no

3912,For what purpose? To stop the inevitable?
3913,"they were all the way at the bottom, downvoted to oblivion. 

I'm surprised I wasn't on the list. My account meets all the criteria.

1. Over 1000 karma, 500 on T_D, &lt;500 on other quarantined subs
1. Has not been suspended within the past year
1. Is not an alt of an ineligible account.

3921,"So, who is playin' Hardball now, #youtoo Chris?"
3922,"I'm sorry, this is such trash. Nothing was wrong. 

Nothing was ever wrong with this place. It's so sanitized and sane. 

They will push this bullshit until this is dead, if it isn't already. 

I don't know what the solution is, but kow-towing to these absolute degenerates isn't it.  

This needs a court case. They are not at all a platform."
3923,[skepticism intensifies]
3924,It better all get copied and pasted here once the gates are opened again
3925,"&gt;They have no constitution to answer to.

And that IS the problem.

The Supreme Law of the Land does not matter much if it isn't followed in heart and soul by the very people of this nation, and brought into every aspect of our lives.

If it is not enshrined in the homes and businesses as the way of life, why should it be enshrined as the way we run our government?

Public or Private, it ought not make a difference."
3926,"Take a step back. They wont ban it. You already know this. They want to take it over, which is what they are doing, all while we cannot post about it.  You (mods) are essentially helping them keep it quiet through the process, ironically enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing is changed, outcome the same. Sub is getting controlled by commies either way eventually. Only difference is mods silenced patriots posts during it."
3927,"We still fight for it which, even though it may not look like it, is what we're doing."
3928,Sounds like Jimmy V. !
3929,"..... nothing ..... 

Literally nothing. But it will still be shadowbanned. Not us though"
3930,That's due to the quarantine. Restricted mode refers to what people can and cannot post.
3931,"We‚Äôre calling for a wall to keep people out, they built a wall to keep people in. We like things like the Great Wall of China and the Maginot Line, not the Berlin Wall or the Great Firewall of China"

3933,And they must resist order 66 from the reddit admins...
3934,"What's the point anyway? This place is dead. May as well try, what else can they take?"

3941,"For what, giving reddit more traffic?  To keep our userbase divided instead of just embracing the new site?  To capitulate with the reddit admins?"
3942,It's kinda weird that restaurants and hotels aren't allowed to discriminate but tech companies can and also stifle speech.
3943,Fuck reddit and fuck Steve Huffman. He admitted to changing people's comments. He'll l do it again
3944,No self-respecting T_D mod applicant would be caught dead applying to be on that list. Boo-urns.
3945,"The only people approved by Reddit are Chicoms, Muslim apologists, leftist lunatics and 3rd wave feminists. I'm sure I left out some demographics, but you guys get the idea."
3946,Reddit is controlled by China-communist thugs. Change my mind.
3947,I got my third lately. But I couldn‚Äôt share that information. I wish I could upvote their warning so they could warn me about that too.
3948,"I'll take the ""Life's Been Good"" Joe Walsh over that NeverTrump loser any day. NeverTrumpers are the lowest form of life."
3949,"I don't know if you T\_D admins will ever read this, but I'm telling you:

Tell them to take that mod list and wedge it right between their cheeks."
3950,"I considered it for all of 60 seconds. There is absolutely zero chance that the admins would have been putting forward someone like me that has been active here for years and actually supports GEOTUS, so I decided not to give them the chance to laugh at my application."
3951,I guess they're holding onto hope? Maybe courts will finally step in and declare that discrimination based on affiliation isn't allowed on public platforms? or maybe reddit will be deemed a publisher? who knows. But if they can hold off the shills from destroying the sub even for a little bit longer I think it's worth it.
3952,Fuck this bull shitt
3953,"SUE REDDIT FOR VIOLATING OUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS!

and meanwhile set your homepage to thedonald.win"
3954,"This is my farewell speech. I've been on this sub since the Republican primaries. I was number 3 thousand something to join this sub ever since I saw the OG centipede song and get in pussy were making America great again meme.

Everyone that stays on this shitty site I'm sorry your basically supporting cucking. Seriously you sit in the corner and watch as Reddit fucks your family. Not only that they have the audacity of bringing back our dead body and masquerading around like it's the same. That's pretty fucking low.

Ever hear the the WW2 stories and wonder why didn't the Jewish people fight back? Also history tends to repeat itself and we're basically the Jews being forced into Ghettos while the Nazis admins have to check ze papers uh I mean post. Scary similar right? That's bc all these faggots do is project.

We can't co-exist with these people plain and simple. They want you and your family and everyone that thinks like us dead. I don't see how this can get resolved peacefully (which I much more prefer). So when the inevitable comes me and my family will be ready and that's probably the only way we will return to our former glory.

Meanwhile the Donald win website is great. Felt like 2015 again when you could talk freely and everyone understands humor and context. I highly encourage everyone to go check it out while the necrophiliacs here defile our former body sort to speak."
3955,"It‚Äôs worse at Twitter, YouTube and Medium but I don‚Äôt see any migration from those sites. All I see are patriots fighting back. Why aren‚Äôt we fighting back? 

The quarantine couldn‚Äôt stop the dragon energy at T_D. Why would we lay down because some mods lost their privileges? Plug in some new mods and keep it going. We can battle the imposters with our 793k downvotes."
3956,"So the quarantine was because of the mods, the restriction was because of the mods, the mod upheaval was because of the mods, the comment locks were because of the mods and now ""unfortunately"" the delay in getting new mods is because of the mods."
3957,"Apt comparison because reddit, like Hong Kong, is now owned by China."
3958,Can we at least get a megathread for Super Tuesday in here?
3959,I got two. You can have one of mine if you want.
3960,"&gt; Reddit specifically targeted the most active mods. The mods they fired were responsible for about 95% of all mod actions.

Seems oddly suspicious to me that somehow 95% of the mods got nuked, yet the mods that didn't are the same ones still active and trying to funnel everyone over to the win"
3961,Can someone explain to me why comments are now being locked too??
3962,"He was blowing a whistle on anything, though he might have been blowing Schiff."
3963,"Only TD, I saw it just a couple of days ago on redacted."
3964,"holy shit, I just realized they're locking comments now too..."
3965,"Well I guess this is it.  Goodbye everybody.  

GOD BLESS AND PROTECT AMERICA! 

GOD BLESS AND PROTECT PRESIDENT TRUMP!"
3966,"You can say it outside of T_D 

But when we do it we're encouraging violence lol"
3967,Of course they did. No free thought or conservatives allowed!
3968,"I wish there was a way that we could help you out, but those of us sticking around are kind of just along for the ride for now."
3969,"Just reject all of them on principle you silly fuck. Let the sub burn.

The active mods who sustained the culture and resisted Reddit influence are already gone. What's left are the ones deemed to be pliant enough to go along with this gay little plan.

JUST FUCKING END IT."
3970,"You accept any of them and this sub will be kissed goodbye permanently with them having itchy trigger fingers to report the first comments and posts their buddies make to justify shutting it down completely. 

I mean, unless that‚Äôs what you want, to make sure people go to your .win anyway."
3971,Chinese sold animals that had been experimented on in the meat market
3972,"so is this /thefitton now? If admins won't let you delete the sub, might as well change the name to what it's becoming hahaha!"
3973,#WHERE IS BRICK BOT!?
3974,"&gt;Lots of people have received no warnings.

There are certain target posts that get you the warning.  Don't upvote those, you don't get the warning, so if you happen to have not seen those posts, then you're in the clear."
3975,it's either that or the admins will change it to /the\_hillary
3976,It was mod drama.  This whole thing is mod drama.  President Trump deserves better than to have the largest Trump community on the internet shut down because of opportunists.
3977,it's heartbreaking
3978,La-Li-Lu-Le-Lo?
3979,Nope. Look to your right and see how many people are here now.
3980,That would be a great idea but then the invitation to a private site would fall flat.
3981,You're right.  It's more NAZI George Soros than it is China.  He's the one who bought out entire subs --  with the CEO's approval.
3982,"That is the position I think we should put the admins.  Make them ban us if that is their true desire.  The current state of the Dom is as close to an outright ban as there can be, and our mods have implemented the restriction themselves."
3983,........... by mods
3984,"""Some mods lost their privileges?"" I think you mean that our mods were almost all purged by the Chinese operatives running Reddit."
3985,bRUH WE CAN'T EVEN GET A FUCKING TRUMP RALLY WATCH PARTY THREAD...
3986,"Oh noes! Please don't throw me in that briar patch, gramps! 

Seriously: you're embarrassing yourself. Your Napoleon complex has mingled with your savior complex and spit out an Oedipus complex. You're just sad.

Keep begging for that fix of fresh posts though. Maybe the Admins will take you up on your revolutionary ""Will Suck Dick for Content"" program."
3987,"They have to be in good standing and can‚Äôt have belonged to quarantined subs or liked questionable content. In other words, they‚Äôll be mods to finish the job.

Even if they liked furry porn or hentai on Reddit, as long as it‚Äôs nothing conservative, they‚Äôll be okay."
3988,Pretty convenient that none of these warnings actually say what content was upvoted to receive the warning.
3989,Sorry but I'm a citizen . New account because I did my part in the great upvote battle.
3990,"upvoted,  but why are you people shitting on .win? There's no doubt that we need a backup, and we can still use both for as long as The\_D remains.... In it's current form .win is where all the meme warfare is happening until things get under control here. No point  in shutting down operations just because it can't be done here..."
3991,We've hit full China. Thanks mods
3992,Must be the tip of the iceberg if he's leaving his big show.
3993,"That's fucking retarded. There has to be something we can do about all of this. Why isn't anyone talking about this fascist bullshit? Don Jr, Parscale, Tucker, nobody is saying shit."
3994,"no goodbyes, only joyful reunions at .win"
3995,I would like to be an admin.
3996,So what? We know it's coming anyways. You going to let TD become a puppet subReddit controlled by communist faggots?
3997,"Millions per year, down the tubes.  It must be bad."

4003,Thank you for all that you do mods (former and current) you are WINNERS
4004,None!
4005,"There's only one way to do it.  You have to have approved submitters and you have to implement the same kind of rules politics does with comment timers. It's the only way a small mod team can keep things from spiraling out of control.  It won't be what it was, but we can at least keep it from being actively used against us."
4006,"Making a lot of sense.  But to answer your question, maybe 'cause .win looks like T_D used to.  So some pedes get complacent and comfortable there and think all they need to do is make memes on a site that looks like T_D used to look, the internet will discover them on their island, and everything will be like 2016 all over again. But forcing the greater community to go there is too much to ask, a meme factory is one thing, but ideas and interaction needs to happen on a site like reddit with all its faults, or one of the ones you mentioned."
4007,The only way to hit back at these cancel-culture-commie pricks is to vote DJT back in. Get organized and committed for Nov 2020.

4018,Fuck the Reddit approved admins. Not a single fuck should be given to any of them modding this sub
4019,They are locked only except for the most recent post.
4020,I‚Äôm here. I wish we would just parade on.
4021,Which is 100% why they locked us out of posting here.
4022,"You can't fight the Reddit administrators and we could all see the handwriting on the wall when the fascists at Reddit quarantined us. Why wouldn't we be glad there's a backup when Reddit is screwing us over at every turn, even getting rid of our mods and replacing them with their own carefully chosen shills?"

Dennis Prager tried that with YouTube. [In sum, the Ninth Circuit said: 'Their house, their rules](https://archive.is/RT4yj). 

&gt;...dismissed the suit, pointing to a Supreme Court ruling just last year noting that while the First Amendment constrains the U.S. government from censoring speech, it doesn‚Äôt apply to private entities. The argument that YouTube is operating essentially as a state actor due to massive presence as an open public forum for content, dialogue, and speech was unsuccessful since the video platform is privately owned and not a public utility or government entity."

If a person who lies in an official capacity and makes a false report gets prosecuted, how will they get others people to do the same if they see risk in it. Meanwhile if you said even a single word wrong to the FBI thats a perjury trap. Funny how now a perjury crime doesn‚Äôt require intent, but a couple years ago it did just like mishandling classifies and top secret information."
4223,"Reddit's recent action to quarantine ideas and ""disagreeable"" content serves one purpose, to propagate leftism. This whole trend is basically a trial phase of a communist social credit system for the US. This is incredibly ironic because many of the most popular posts on this whole site within the last two years are criticisms of the Chinese communist government. Normie reddit users love their slacktivism and civil disobedience only if they have no skin in the g
game.
 
Why does Reddit have to proactively take measures to shield its userbase from conservative thought? Why is it not enough for them to allow users, on an individual basis, to block, hide or unsub from content they don't want to see? They are clearly in favor of one particular ideology and censor anything that doesn't conform to that ideology as wrong think."
4224,Man at least don't lie about it. We all know you want your racist subreddits to stay on this site. You're not fooling anyone except maybe yourself

Have no trust in the new moderaters if they do not restore basic functionality here.

I will NOT censor my views for some mitt romney mod.

In my time on reddit, I have seen how this site has systematically closed down voices of anyone right of centre on excuse of ""hurt feefees"".

This entire website is now becoming a left wing echo chamber, the vox and slate of social media.

I dont know how much of actblue's or chinese D is up spez's a$$ to be a sell out of such an extent.

This site is now becoming worse than twitter.

I have a feeling that if mods can keep this sub running, that reddit will do something desperate closer to November. Hopefully when they do, it rocks this site as a whole. Regardless of what sub, this amount of violation from the admins is sickening and at the very least an eye opening to just how far gone the left has become.

The r/news sub lists [23 moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/about/moderators) for a sub with  20 million 'readers' and 24k ""users here now"". 

The alternate Donald mirror site (.win) also lists [23 moderators](https://thedonald.win/moderators) -  10 who are also currently listed as moderators of The_Donald. I don't know how many readers or users there are at .win but based on what I've read about the .win website, there's not any censorship so you would think it might be easier to moderate. Right?

Maybe I'm way out of line here, but couldn't a few of those 10 T_D mods busy over at the .win site spare a little time to post a Trump tweet or a Trump rally feed for those of us here missing our T_D? 

They had the rally live at the .win site today. Couldn't they have just copied the text/links and pasted them here? There's only been 3,500 pedes or so around here lately since the mods had to shutter T_D. It seems they could manage that. Right? 

Maybe they just want us to all watch the rally together at .win. Or maybe they are worried that if they give pedes a choice, we might prefer to MAGA at T_D? Maybe I'm overthinking all this?"

That's all this ever has been about, election interference. They'll never realize this dumpster of a site has no fucking meaning on the electorate. They'll be shitting bricks when their masters over at the DNC rig the election again and Trump wins his second term. It will be fucking glorious.

4379,"&gt; Both the government and private companies can censor stuff. But private companies are a little bit scarier. They have no constitution to answer to. They‚Äôre not elected. They have no constituents or voters. All of the protections we‚Äôve built up to protect against government tyranny don‚Äôt exist for corporate tyranny.
&gt; 
&gt; Is the internet going to stay free? Are private companies going to censor [the] websites I visit, or charge more to visit certain websites? Is the government going to force us to not visit certain websites? And when I visit these websites, are they going to constrain what I can say, to only let me say certain types of things, or steer me to certain types of pages? All of those are battles that we‚Äôve won so far, and we‚Äôve been very lucky to win them. But we could quite easily lose, so we need to stay vigilant.

&gt;Don't read the news. Only CCPNN can read the news, and tell you what to think about it.

Let me get this straight: Adam Schiff fucks up, the press notices it, and runs with it, nothing happens to the guy who fucked up, nothing happens to the guy whose name was leaked, and people are censored for discussing something you will get pages on with a basic internet search.

It‚Äôs apparent that the only thing Reddit wants is to *silence and ostracize* conservatives on their platform. They can say whatever they want, but their actions and inaction against other communities that obviously ‚Äúbreak the rules‚Äù but do not get quarantined, as well as inaction against posters who harass conservatives make their true intent apparent.

YouTube advertises itself as a ""platform for all"" and the judge basically (or quite literally, I can't remember) called it ""puffery"" and was in effect just advertising.  It didn't have merit.

Therefore, private company.  And for now, it ends there (unless they take it to the Supreme Court I believe.)"

4516,"Shame, shame, shame... u/spez - this,Reddit, used to be a bastion of light, free speech, and lively debate. Reddit was my go to. I was proud to be apart of it. Here. Right here. You made it a farce, and your friend Aaron is rolling in his grave right now for you letting this perversion of free speech exist. 

Damn politics, damn the left, damn the right, hell even damn the moderates. You sold out free speech. You took over for Ellen, took the reigns back after the first waves of censorship, and Reddit would be right again. I‚Äôve never been so wrong in my life. You were supposed to restore Reddit, not destroy it. 

Do the right thing. Not under the guise of anything but to do the right thing. Even when nobody is looking. It‚Äôs called integrity and I believe you still have some buried deep within you. Let the group choose it‚Äôs own admins, and reinstate it. No more quarantine, no more bullshit.

This place has been filling with shills for a while now, the cards are in place and our time is limited..  Reddit is a shithole."
4518,"Fuck it, guys. Why are you even trying to appease the admins? They declared war to this subreddit a long time ago and they have proven that they don't care about their own rules or fairness. Everything they are doing since then is just sp\*z' pathetic attempt to not look like a piece of shit. They literally just purged your moderators and are earlier or later going to turn this sub into their own clown show.

Was the night before the coup, when all through the land.

Not a backbone was stirring, not even a man.¬†

The collusion was laid, by the court without care.

In hopes that Killary, soon would be there.

The Dems were nestled all snug in their heads, while visions of Maddow danced in their heads.

And Strzok in his SCIF, Lisa Page taking notes.¬†

Had just settled their brains for an election night poke.

When out in the booths arose such a clatter.

CNN checked the poles, to see what was the matter.

Away to the vote, we flew like a flash.

Leaving work early, to vote out the past.

The tear in my eye, fell on flyover snow.

As the rigged elections, were dealt a serious blow.

When, what to joy came up from below.¬†

But an orange skinned man, constitution in tow.

Giving them the rope needed, so lively and quick,¬†

I knew in a moment this Trump man was slick.

More rapid than eagles, Meuller made moves out of fear.¬†

And when he was done, the truth still came clear.

Now Graham! Now, Gowdey! Now, Nunes! Now, Crenshaw!¬†

On, Bongino! On, Solomon! On, Tucker! On, Hannity and Undercover Huber!

To the top of the swamp! Lets bring it down fast.

Drain away all the scum, and whip the Dems ass!

Their timeline, their lies.

Nothings adding up

The average american,

Has just had enough.

&gt;Under current law, a social media company is generally immune from liability with respect to content posted on its platform by users and other content providers. However, the bill removes this statutory immunity unless the social media company obtains certification from the Federal Trade Commission that it does not moderate information on its platform in a manner that is biased against a political party, candidate, or viewpoint.

If the establishment liberals continue to deny the progressives the nomination, I will go scorched earth and Trump will have my vote in protest.

In the end though, Trump has done me no wrong, and ever since the liberal takeover of the democratic party in 72, progressives have been told to shut up, fall in line, and vote for liberalism.

I can no longer do this.  A progressive is as far removed from a liberal as they are a conservative, but Ill give you guys this much credit:  at least when you choose your nominee you do so democratically.  You give winner take all by state, as we do in the general election, and you do not use party elites via super delegates to tip the scale one way or another.

So as I said, sometimes the enemy of the enemy is my friend, and if Sanders is denied, I will cast a protest vote for progressivism against liberalism."

5000,Why the fuck was this thread DELETED!?
5001,"LOL,  no one cares,  Reddit already made it a shithole like /politics /news  etc."
5002,WGAF? We'll downvote the shills to oblivion and humiliate them in the process. That's what we do here. Rubber-stamp the admin's mods and re-open the site. It's Super Shitpost Tuesday and I'm fucking hongry....
5003,We have relocated to http://thedonald.win
5004,"The mods do realize that Reddit isn't a news site and we still have a right to vote, right? 

The absolute denial they are living in, not knowing how well he's doing out in Pennsylvania right now. My parents drove through Selinsgrove the other day and it was Trump signs everywhere. 

And my family in the Midwest is saying more and more people are comfortable admitting they voted/are gonna vote for him. 

Dear Mods, all you're doing is silencing us on Reddit. We still vote. You can't stop me at the voting booth. I don't really understand this, but then again it doesn't make any logical sense."

Yeah, we know what this means."
5006,"All red, hope cali can be less shit today"
5007,"Oh trust me, they're there. You just need to know where to look. Sort it by new and hit deport."
5008,"I defend the mods because I get they are between a rock and a hard place handling reddit admins and the sub users' expectations about what should be happening, but if they're never open to allowing vetted user posts then the mods themselves need to be more active here. This one to two posts a day shit is not cutting it and I dont buy that they're too busy to post just once every hour at the minimum. It would also go a long way in alleviating a lot of the complaining here about folding. There should be at least some semblance of continuity here. 

It doesnt need to be about reddit drama. Just objective election/news developments. Is there a reason they cant even post that? I see one trump tweet in the last 5 days posted here. Has he really only tweeted one time since then or are you not posting them? Shouldn't that be the bare minimum content here? There were zero posts about Pete and Klobuchar dropping out before super Tuesday and backing Biden. You cant even post that to let people discuss it?"
5009,Dude's up there traveling through time.

5011,I wondered if they‚Äôd get pissed to see so many people staying here with so little going on. I believe I got my answer. Lol. There‚Äôs more comments on these posts than anything over there.

I‚Äôm not a Bernie fan in the least bit but he‚Äôs going to be fucked over again. We might be able to have some of all that free stuff if we had a closed border, deported the roughly 20-30 million illegals, stopped sending all of our tax dollars overseas, took the government out of the college loan business to name a few things. The last two decades of endless war and the Patriot Act didn‚Äôt help us any either.

If there is no interaction among members, no active dialogue or back and forth conversation between comments it becomes not much different in what we are experiencing here.  I'll take what I can get.  I like the members here and our unified, mostly high spirited effort to keep our voices heard.  At least here I'm not being accused of being a shill because I don't want to be a part of the agitated echo chamber of any group of people.**"

5087,because there arent enough mods to kick out the cucked comments and the admins will use that an excuse to ban the sub for not keeping up with sub moderation.

5145,"To me a liberal takes from the rich and gives to the poor with no return of investment.  This creates class divides, and they then further these divides to social culture as well.

To me a progressive takes from all and gives to all.  

To use healthcare as an example and bernies medicare for all vs the aca.

The aca takes from the rich, gives to the poor, and provides nothing in return to the rich, puts no cost controls in place, and drives up costs for the middle class.  It creates 3 seperate classes of people who then battle each other.  So the rich pay, but they cant even benefit from the service.

Sanders' m4a plan places a 4% income tax on income over 29k (which would be any full time worker if min wage was raised to $15 an hour, so literally every full time worker), and a 7.5% payroll tax on businesses with revenue over 2 million.   So sure, you do have a baseline, where anyone not working does get free stuff, but, since it does not affect small businesses i see this as a tradeoff for entrepreneurs being able to leave their jobs and provide for themselves.

Beyond the baseline, everyone rich or poor pays the same percentage, so everyones affect on personal wealth is affected the same based on ratio of earnings.   There is no class conflict, because everyone benefits from the same entitlement.

I see progressivism done right as a benefit to capitalism, whether it be health promoting new business ventures, or education promoting more skilked labor.

Progressivism helps capitalism, liberalism (in the us) destroys it.

Thats my take anyway.  I get that most on the right favor free market solutions.  I just dont think it's possible when the motive of the free market is profit.

If that makes me a communist in anyones eyes... then call me what you will.

But, at the very least maybe we can agree that american liberals have destroyed the middle class."

If we give up here we are isolating ourselves, and taking away our greatest resource for converting people to see the truth about Trump. Fuck the admins for trying to take us over, but we have the truth on our side, and every time they pull stuff and we call them out on it, we gain countless new people on our side."
5171,Biden is going with abrams
5172,This is some serious BS. So other subs actively post nonsense and things that would get them quarantined or removed yet nothing is done. But oh a pro trump subreddit where nothing obscene is posted is the one getting hate ü§î hell they even made fake accounts and bots just so they can post things to get this sub quarantined üòÇSAD

Oh totally.  Because a private company establishing and enforcing rules is the same as an authoritarian government.  You have a Constitutional right to be able to select your own Reddit moderators--I believe that was addressed in the 16th Amendment, IIRC.  

This is a real injustice and you have a strong legal case if you decide to sue."

5183,"So look, in a way I owe you an apology. You're reaching out to those outside of your view and looking to interact and talk in a sane way. That's a great and commendable thing.

On the other hand, the danger all movements have is that they become such a big tent that they lose the whole ideology they were behind. Free markets, the second amendment, an actual immigration policy, private health care, getting the government out of Education. These are all things that we as Trump supporters believe are not negotiable. These are all things that Bernie is out to destroy. We went through a similar issue when Yang dropped out and a bunch of people came here who still thought Yang was a good guy but didn't want to support the DNC wanted to support Trump. There's no place here for people who think UBI and a China-style social credit score are remotely acceptable positions.

People do change, particularly in the world of politics where so much has been hidden from us for so long. I was an open-borders libertarian in my youth, another position that I now consider unacceptable.

This is why the meme here on this forum is that they can come, but they must disavow. There is plenty of room for those of us who have seen the error of our ways. There is no room for anybody who thinks Bernie and his supporters are not an existential threat."

5192,Ok? But can you tell me why we can‚Äôt?
5193,"Just happened to me, good point."
5194,There was a post that one of the old mods posted a week or so ago detailing all the behind the scenes happenings between them.  This subreddit has a rule that mods won't make money off of this to prevent shilling.  Well the mods that created .win did so against the mods rules and also did not remove an advertising disclaimer in their TOS.  They let this place rot out though in order to drive traffic.  I'll find the post for you.
5195,"Establishment Dems ganged up on Bernie and looks like it might tip the odds in Biden‚Äôs favor.

Sanders supporters are gonna be asking for refunds again..."
5196,"The reason only 3 accounts can post is because reddit removed most of the mods here and are replacing them with God knows who.  If Trump supporters can't mod a Trump subreddit then obviously it won't go well.  It's also in protest of the new upvote equals ban rule that was rolled out.  Reddit was/is attacking free speech here thus the need for putting this subreddit in restricted mode.  
.win is not as stagnant as you describe.  If you don't participate and keep suggesting others shouldn't either then of course it won't grow.  There is plenty of energy there, the comments are great and the memes are plenty spicy.  I get that you miss triggering here and redpilling but you do realize you can still do that right?  It sad that you can't move on.  Reddit is like fucking crack to some people."
5197,Same with being critical of any Trump decisions.
5198,This is exactly what cuck Reddit wanted.
5199,Not better.  I exist there.  And so do plenty others.  I can still stand my ground and go there too.  You can have both.  I won't miss reddit once thedonald is completely gone.  Fuck reddit entirely.
5200,"North Carolina will have voter ID in effect for the election in November. Trump is going to get the Republican nomination here and no one is really concerned about who the Dems nominate because their system is loaded with fuckery in regards to their super delegate system of picking who they want regardless of the popular vote. Not sure about the rest of the states, but NC will have voter ID in place when it counts the most."
5201,"Good luck.

Me, I've had it with Reddit.    What they did is simply unacceptable."
5202,I wonder why my post is still active for comments? IDK why but I kinda like it... :)
5203,"the ""Update"" announcement post is being shadowbanned effectively - I have been checking it once every few minutes for hours, and yet even though any other post on reddit loads fine, for that one post I get every time the ""our servers are busy"" splash screen."
5204,"Thank you for posting this. Some other pede - or possibly you - posted it here on another thread yesterday, and when I went back to comment the ENTIRE THREAD was gone! The article you link paints a very believable picture of what POSSIBLY may have gone down, and I've yet to see a rebuttal submitted by the dot WIN mods about it. If the article is true, the mods running dot WIN are despicable, and I want no more to do with their echo chamber. WHY CAN'T WE HAVE BOTH???????? ü§î"

I view things a with a bit more nuance.  I dont consider a free market conservative to be a fascist in any sense of the word, but many on the left do (as they too take a black and white view), just as many on the right view everyone as a comnunist.  I am much more of a grey person."

5250,Why is it only hay that is on fire? I don't see equal representation between all sources of fuel.
5251,"Well the 29k is based off full time min wage of a government employee (8 hour days, but half hour unpaid lunch, 37.5 hours a week equals $29,250).   If you are a minimum wage worker here in pa, you currently make federal minimum, $7.25.  You also likely qualify for the aca, and pay nothing but co-pays, or you use the emergency room.  Either of which are liberal policies, and drive up the cost for everyone else.

By raising the min wage to 15, and imposing a 4% tax on income over 29k, you make every full time worker a contributor of the system.  

So, if you already have insurance now, you save money overall.  And if you dont have insurance you gain it.   Every full time worker has skin in the game.  But then we have a built in fall back system incase you lose your job, or you want to start your own business.

I see this as a positive for capitalism over all.  And remember, this only replaces the paying mechanism, the insurance company.  This is not nationalization of doctors and hospitals themselves.  It simply cuts out the middleman, and saves most people money.

Now if you make large amounts of money, eventually that 4% does become greater than what you currently pay for health coverage, but, everyone pays an equal share by ratio."

5329,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If you have a black and white view of things, then anyone on the left is a communist and anyone on the right is a fascist. Those are the extremes on both ends.

Let's talk about this part first.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Fascism -  
&gt;  
&gt;*often capitalized*  
&gt;  
&gt;a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized [autocratic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/autocratic) government headed by a [dictatorial](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dictatorial) leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.

As per Merriam-Webster. The only fascists I see, ironically, are the liberal/progressive folks who are part of antifa, the domestic terror group, or the bernie supporters/lefties who support communist/socialist policies like M4A.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Communism -  
&gt;  
&gt;**1**  
&gt;  
&gt;**a:** a system in which goods are owned in [common](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/common) and are available to all as needed  
&gt;  
&gt;**b:** a theory advocating elimination of private property  
&gt;  
&gt;**2**  
&gt;  
&gt;*capitalized*  
&gt;  
&gt;**a:** a doctrine based on revolutionary Marxian [socialism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socialism) and Marxism-Leninism that was the official ideology of the U.S.S.R.  
&gt;  
&gt;**b:** a totalitarian system of government in which a single [authoritarian](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/authoritarian) party controls state-owned means of production  
&gt;  
&gt;**c:** a final stage of society in Marxist theory in which the state has withered away and economic goods are distributed equitably  
&gt;  
&gt;**d:** [communist](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communist) systems collectively

Again, as per Merriam-Webster

&amp;#x200B;

So your main gripe is being thrown in with the commies, but, and I believe I can safely speak for most conservatives here, both communism and socialism are intolerable. I see you speak out against communism but we haven't seen what your opinion on socialism is and I think that's the real crux of the argument here and why you can't seem to be able to talk on the same page as other folks here. In the future, you should clearly state where your position is on something. You state you're a capitalist, and yet you support all these socialist policies so you're sending mixed signals and nobody can figure out what your point is.

Furthermore, you say you're more of a grey person and yet you seem the least likely to budge on your worldview here, though, maybe that is due in part to nobody being able to figure out what your worldview IS due to the incompatible ideas you espouse.

For the sake of the discussion, let's clear up a few definitions aside from the ones I've already detailed above. I'd like to hear what you think each of these are so that we can accurately ascertain where you're coming from in all this.

* What is a progressive?
* What is a liberal?
* What is a conservative?
* What is a capitalist?
* What is socialism?
* In what way is M4A capitalist rather than socialist/communist?

Then to better help you understand why we lump socialists in with the commies, in short, is that for the most part, socialism is just communism-lite as you can see below:

&gt;**1:** any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods  
&gt;  
&gt;**2**  
&gt;  
&gt;**a:** a system of society or group living in which there is no private property  
&gt;  
&gt;**b:** a system or condition of society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the state  
&gt;  
&gt;**3:** a stage of society in Marxist theory transitional between [capitalism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism) and [communism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communism) and distinguished by unequal distribution of goods and pay according to work done

Again, as per Merriam-Webster.

So, maybe with that, if you are as grey as you claim then maybe you can finally see where we are coming from in this regard and why we can't wrap our heads around someone being able to mentally support two diametrically opposed ideals at the same time, and, if you do actually support those two opposing ideals, how are you not in constant internal conflict on a daily basis?

I think, much like you, I as well like a level-headed political discussion and I'm not saying you don't do this, but my preference is to define all the keywords and topics beforehand as to properly ascertain each participants position in the discussion so that we can reduce the amount of exchanges made in vain as we discover we weren't even speaking the same 'language'.

To end of my comment here, I really do gotta tip my hat to you for stepping into a place where you know people don't agree with you, though, you're better off that it's us you disagree with because on the whole, I think that we're more open to having discussion than the folks on the other side of the aisle who prefer to censor and shout down those they disagree with like the fascist the ascribe us to be.

Cheers

5517,Gonna have me some *fish tacos* tonight for dinner. Mmm mmm good.
5518,"Only it's worse.   First there's the central authority (China, Reddit) telling you who can be mods, then there's the local authority (HK pols, T_D mods) adding their own level of political shannigans to the process.

At this point it isn't clear if the terminated and existing mods were creating the problem with Reddit thru selective moderation or if it's all Reddit.  Look, the mods said they wanted to comply and get the quarantine lifted, but reddit is saying they weren't actually complying.  I don't have enough information to tell who's lying.  But it's possible that the mod team was either opposing reddit, or just pretending to comply while undermining the sub by leaving enough rule violations active to keep it quarantined.  

After the td.win play and their infighting and locking the sub, no one should be taking what the T_D mods say at face value."
5519,"Been here at T\_D since the beginning, reddit for like 8 years.

I've barely ever encountered a 'concern troll' let alone the racist, violent, bigotted, blah blah blah that reddit claims.

Venturing out into other political subs, the way they speak about this place - it's like either they literally have never spent time here or they are repeating talking points from 3rd hand haters. I just can't believe the way this place has been treated.

When they nuke The\_Donald, it will be my last day on reddit ever and I will never ever support it or the people behind whats happened ever again if I can help it."
5520,We can all go over there and tell them how bad the dnc has fucked them and the only payback is another 4yrs of DJT üëç

5522,I want a live watch party too in the comments section baby!!!! Got it to us mods
5523,"Our high energy combined with countless NPCs who come here to post rule-breaking content with the sole intent of getting the dom banned/taken over makes for a very difficult situation where a limited mod staff needs to manually sift through every post/comment without automod or human backup.

The remaining moderators are working around the clock to keep T_D out of the hands of the admins. Please note that there are only 11 moderators left (not including the incapacitated AutoModerator) and the admins have not installed their own cucks: https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/about/moderators/

5524,"Yeah unfortunately it will reach a much smaller number of people. People hear other people talking shit about this sub on reddit and it draws them in, the same cant be said when it is another site entirely."
5525,"""Come here to post! Just kidding, now go over there. Don't ask questions."" Kinda weird. Trying to remain impartial but even the flimsiest of excuses would at least be something. The stonewall is very discouraging."

5534,Fuck reddit
5535,I cast my 'support' vote for GEOTUS. He didn't need it but I want him to know we are still thinking about him.
5536,"Good try but there is no hypocrisy here.  I believe all private companies have the right to set and enforce rules for their own platforms.  There is no inconsistency at all.

You think there must be competition?  Tell you what: go start your own platform.  That‚Äôs what competitor means, kid.  What are you waiting for? If your idea is so good, it will be a hit, and if not, then maybe you‚Äôll finally start to understand that it‚Äôs you who sucks, not anyone else.

Start your own competing platform and then let us libs and leftists (and everyone else) come in and do and say whatever we want.  If you try to moderate us in any way (like you snowflakes do here in your lit, that‚Äôs deplarforming us and we will sue the fuck out of you.

You won‚Äôt do that though.  You want to demand that you get to use someone else‚Äôs work and property!  The sense of entitlement in you people is really off the charts. Instead of starting your own competing company and running it any way you want, you think you can sue someone else‚Äôs company into doing what you want them to.

It‚Äôs pathetic.  You are an entitled little pussy."

5637,Let‚Äôs just get his measurements for now
5638,"https://youtu.be/m0EuqJLhhDA

Here a sheer hulk, lies poor The_Donald

The darling of our crew;

No more he'll hear the tempest howling

For death has broached him to.

His form was of the manliest beauty,

his heart was kind and soft;

Faithful below, Don did his duty
 
And now he's gone aloft
 
And now he's gone aloft"
5639,Where?
5640,"I said *we* meaning this sub.  That's the carrot on the stick.  Leave here, go there.  No thanks."
5641,Wait.. why can‚Äôt I say that? THEY. And be referring to black people?
5642,r / trump
5643,"I've only ever used old reddit, so I don't know if that was ever in regular reddit."
5644,Why are the posts being locked
5645,"Since this is the only recent thread not locked lemme just say: what the fuck happened to that psycho working at the old folks home bragging about killing old Trump supporters??! Why won‚Äôt Reddit mention this story anymore? Because they were radicalized by the politics sub? Another psycho Bernie Bro.

Spez: again, as always the case, imagine if the roles were reversed. Also, look at what that local congresswoman (reee) said about wanting to spread coronavirus at a MAGA rally. Sick fucks."
5646,"I don't understand the distinction. As I see it, this function was created by the Reddit admins, who are the ones imposing this election meddling on us. Let me know if there's a distinction I don't get. Thanks."
5647,Finally A meme. It's been awhile.
5648,It's The Donald Super Tuesday MAGA thread whether you like it or not.
5649,"The Mods locked the Super Tuesday MAGAThread?

HONK FUCKING HONK"
5650,How come this place is locked and nobody is in .win either? Pedes are slacking over there.
5651,Maybe I misunderstood your post.  I was just saying that you're not special.  No regular  peon noboby user can post.
5652,Bring the whole cast back for the season finale.
5653,Ok.
5654,"The graphic I provided above, if ‚ÄúTHEY‚Äùare the blacks in that graphic, who is allowed to say what I said? Can a black person ask it? What if I was black? 
Why when ‚Äúyou‚Äù can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt debate or fix a horrible problem (like the homicide rate in Baltimore), thats where I live, you simply toss the problem aside by saying. Mddet is racist! What if I wasn‚Äôt racist? What if I wasn‚Äôt what you perceive me to be?
Wouldn‚Äôt you feel bad? Wouldn‚Äôt you be apologizing to me? You don‚Äôt know me, you don‚Äôt know my race, gender, anything, but you are judge jury and executioner all in a few comments on Reddit. Well shame on you."
5655,Fuck Comey and Biden. Fuck all the God damn Democrats!
5656,Remember this is Reddit. Most of the people here are going to be the most outspoken and seriously conspiracy minded individuals. It's a rarity for someone talking down a conspiracy (such as the Q BS) to be upvoted. I've basically given up trying to reason with people heh.
5657,"It isn't about spiting him but rather delegitimizing the one thing that will get him reelected; a soaring economy. I explain more here: 

https://old.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/fcmty3/an_update_to_the_ongoing_situation/fjdchzv/"
5658,Doesn't matter because people aren't hearing about Reddit T_D in search engines they are hearing about it from other Domreddits/Subreddits where posters mention it. It's genuinely organic and that's why they want us off of Reddit and our mods are helping them accomplish that goal.
5659,"Farewell T_D.  You turned me from Bernie to Trump.  I learned to meme and added my content to thousands of others.  

My favorite memory is bot-hunting and helping  aim the banhammer"
5660,Minnesota?
5661,"I now only  a handful of posts each day now from TD, and really only the ones from Fitton/ Judicial watch. I get all my other content  from other subs in reddit.....So my content is being restricted as well?  Anyone else getting this? Started about 5 days ago......"
5662,"That's exactly what a shill would say!!! 

:)"
5663,"Anyone else find it funny that all the Super Tuesday states don‚Äôt require voter ID? 
I‚Äôm standing by for banning, I guess."
5664,Fuck reddit
5665,Above RULES - it tells you to visit the canary.
5666,You have been banned from The_Donald. Please write an apology or become permanently banned.
5667,Fuck communist reddit
5668,"Lol, you can tell he‚Äôs a shill because his only advice is to go find a safe space!"
5669,They can't moderate.  Shills will post violent content to justify banning.  It's wise to shut down comments imo
5670,Hi pede üëã
5671,"There is no genuinely organic way to get to /r/The_Donald on reddit at this point.  The only way here is if someone specifically points you to us.

How is that any different than telling people about .win, or armyfortrump, or anything else for that matter?"

5673,Interesting

You need a better excuse than being lazy and not messing with settings."
5676,"The GOP doesn't have superdelegates, either. The Democrat Party is very controlling about who their nominee is. Independents have a much bigger say on the GOP side, hence Trump winning the nomination. 

I guarantee you Buttigieg was offered something big to drop out so early. V.P. slot? All to make sure Bernie loses. 

I disagree with everything Bernie stands for, but like Ron Paul, he never wavers from his principles no matter unpopular."
5677,"This is watching election interference happening in real time. 

Any Reddit-approved moderator is someone stepping over a picket line. Do not comply with the obvious methods Reddit is employing to influence the election. Let this sub die rather than be ""Reddit-approved."" As a company policy, they are definitely not a bastion of free speech, and it needs to be painfully clear that it's not. To that point, neither is r/the_donald. In reality, both are very clearly working to a political goal. But only one considers itself a platform. 

Also, why are so many new posts having their comments locked?"
5678,A lot of that is libertarian.

5689,Not a problem. I replied to someone earlier with it but the comment seems to have disappeared.
5690,"wtf, is sub completely banned now? Nothing from it on my main page, everything is flooded with bernie subs and nothing else.

Request for list of user subscriptions does not even include this sub."
5691,Biggest excuse? Poor minorities can't take time off from work or time off in general to get an a driver's license or state ID.
5692,I see the new mods are being assrangers already.
5693,Scream it from the mountain tops. Fucking communist shills
5694,"Not true; the comment count there is clunky and updates slowly; most of those 15-30 comment threads in fact have 50-75 comments!  It's not the same as a T_D mega-thread by any stretch, but it's livelier than it looks at a glance.

Stay here for the shitposting fight of a lifetime; go there for the lulz in your downtime; at least, that's what I'm doing."

5708,"Because of the democrats apportionment of delegates.  Bernie tied in iowa, came up 2 delegates short, won in nh, tied delegates, won huge in nevada, barely saw a lead in delegates.

They are awarded at the county level, so a candidate could in theory win by a huge margin in the popular vote, and have less delegates.

And since they arent awarded as winner take all, it makes contested nominations much more likely, in that again the person with the most delegates going into the convention could in theory lose to the person with the least through consolidation.

This system alone, combined with super delegates is designed specifically to keep progressive candidates out and favors centrists.  This has been the case since the 72 mcgovern nixon election."
5709,"&gt;Reddit is serious about wanting to host conservatives on their platform during this election season.

But they want to ensure that these Conservatives are toeing the liberal line and do not say or post anything that might keep a socialist from being elected or help reelect the President."
5710,"Woah, at first thought it was a bit harsh but upon further investigation I agree."
5711,Lets demand that we get a say in who the mods are on leftist sites.

Kudos to the remaining Patriot mods still doing the Lord's work keeping the shills out and concern trolling to a minimum."
5717,"Due in part to nixons popularity, and an inability for the party to come together after the nomination.

If i remember correctly nixon had roughly the same votes in 68 as he did in 72 (if you add in wallaces votes in 68 to nixon), mcgovern had way less."

*While the Internet is generally seen as a beacon for information and openness, he expresses concern that private companies have less restrictions on censoring the Internet than government...*

&gt;*""Private companies are a little bit scarier because they have no constitution to answer to, they‚Äôre not elected really, they don‚Äôt have constituents or voters.""*  

*He says that while proponents against censorship in the private sphere have been successful, advocates of a free Internet should be concerned about both private and public censorship efforts in the future.*

*We stand for free speech. This means* _**we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits.**_ *We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States ‚Äì because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it ‚Äì but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform.*

&gt;[Vox Interviews reddit CEO About T_D Quarantine](http://archive.is/7Qsxr)

&gt;*I have in mind of a series of things they could do that would be steps in the right direction. One of them, without going into specifics, one of the things I would like to see is ownership of, ‚ÄúWe are going to support the president, but we are not going to have anything remotely violent on this community, and we are going to enforce that ruthlessly.‚Äù*

&gt;*If I saw that message, and then I saw them do that in the data, that would be a compelling argument. Instead, we saw a YouTube video stickied on the top that was the equivalent of ‚Äúsend her back,‚Äù and so I saw that, and* _**me and our policy lead Jessica were like, ‚ÄúWell, doesn‚Äôt look like they want to be un-quarantined next week.‚Äù**_ *So, we‚Äôll see.*"
5729,"I really hope Joe is the nominee. Trump would steamrole him in the debates.

Bernie is crazy but can at least formulate a sentence."
5730,"I think we all suspect that a few black-clad pantyfa will proceed to kick around a garbage can or two, and that'll be that."
5731,"No, no, you don't understand; upvoting *conservative* posts is against Reddit policy.  Are you some sort of Nazi?"
5732,Don‚Äôt know why you are getting downvoted. To me it seems obvious after that sticky.
5733,"&gt;Unfortunately, candidates need to go through our regular vetting process in which we learn their age, location, experience, reason for wanting to moderate, as well as putting them through a voice interview, which is then followed by extensive training. We cannot hand anyone the keys to The Donald without taking these important steps.

It this really a standard vetting process for other subs? I kinda doubt it."
5734,"I bitched about that whole thing a good bit, but a lot of people just accepted it. We bitched, but not hard enough."
5735,"No idea, my comment was pretty highly upvoted for awhile too, maybe it‚Äôs a bunch of bots? Something fucky is going on here"
5736,"While I don't agree with Bernie's policy positions, I do think a party should give the nomination to the person who wins it. The DNC fixed 2016 for Hillary and seems to be on its way to do it again for Biden (though I think they'll use him as a placeholder for Hillary or Michelle Obama till the convention). That's just not fair or right. Best wishes and thanks for engaging us in a civil conversation."
5737,What is this shite
5738,"That's why they're trying to shove us to that other site. They don't want us here, but that's just too bad."

Republicans favor the electoral college but elect their nominee by popular vote

The democrats favor the popular vote in the general election, but elect their nominee by an electoral system.

5746,Admins aren't going to let that happen. Mods already tried shutting it down and the admins just opened it up again. They're determined to keep this as quiet as possible.
5747,TRUMP/DON JR NEEDS TO BRING LIGHT TO THIS BULLSHIT
5748,Fuck off cunt faggot (bundle of sticks btw)
5749,I think their plan is to (a) encourage a lot of leftist trolls to come here and post things to make Trump supporters look bad and (b) to make it look like we're divided.
5750,"Yeah, because cucked admins/mods say we should go there, we should all just abandon ship. Right? Screw that."
5751,TRUMP/DON JR NEED TO MAKE LIGHT OF THIS SHIT ALREADY
5752,"Yeah.. hillary literally bought the party in 2014 (dnc was nearing bankruptcy, and she used campaign funds to run the dnc through the election).  So bernie was right, it was rigged from the start.

The guy then says ""No, she is my sister, I am getting married with my chicken."" and the baker says ""Sorry I wont make a cake under such circumstances.""

The baker is free to do that, what the baker is not free to do is to lie saying he is going to do the cake and then at the day of the ""marriage"" says ""sorry I didnt made your cake""."
5761,No it isn't 'solved'. Its removed... purposely.
5762,You sound mad.
5763,Every other post is locked. This is fucking ridiculous.

5769,Because voter id's would be racist in MN!... But we are all required to get smart IDs soon...
5770,Mods are gay if they ban me viva la revolution
5771,So the cucks and soy boys don‚Äôt post rule breaking content to further fuck the sub. A necessary evil for the time being.
5772,Very true
5773,The damn commies got me ya'll I'm a leftist now! Getting likes in some of the few commie threads I've been granted privilege to post in. The other commies like ideas such as minority communities are to blame for Qrunqz landslide 2020 because they can't get an I.D in the next 7 months. The commies here give unbannable up votes for such things! Voter ID bad like orange.
5774,So make the admins ban the Dom then.  That would be preferable to this situation.
5775,Fuck u reddit
5776,I saw the MAGAthread and though maybe the mods had allowed us a post on here where we could comment.  No such luck.

5789,As a former Trump supporter who is now a flag waving fash booferer I think I have found the truest leftist candidate is Biden. Has racist Bernie ever been out ranked by a Black man? You know the answer I know the answer. Bernie is also a racist like Qrunqz.

5805,is this site wide or just this sub? HONK HONK
5806,"it‚Äôs a special rule just for quarantined communities because it would be insane to implement such an insane rule on a larger scale. 

No need to either. All they really want to do is kill T_D with it."
5807,"Their doing this because they do not want people like us organizing.  From TD we were able to publish and propagate memes that countered their own.  They have to lie all the time, as their lies build up it becomes easier for the truth to disrupt their narratives.  They are trying desperately to regain media supremacy.  What we should be doing to raiding their safe spaces and subverting their narratives where they form.  They will not let us organize so we should interfere with their ability to organize."

So it is probably quite a bit more."

5811,It is defiantly foreign but it is not Chinese.  There are many other subs that complain about the Chinese.  They do not get treated like this.  Even the mainstream media is allowed to criticize the Chinese.  The Chinese do not have the pull to get rid of TD.

 Fuck China Reddit"

5836,"I would like to hear your solution to the healthcare problem. My fiancee got a $3500 bill for an MRI in the mail and its devastating. For the first time I get why its such an important issue and I think its why were seeing people warm up to socialism. Free healthcare is a sexy idea to people who haven't been educated on the free market but where is the sexy Republican idea? Its seems they only wanna talk about ""no we cant do healthcare cuz communism"". I agree with that sentiment but its a battle of ideas and the right has nothing to say other than fear mongering."
5837,Ridiculous that voter ID isn't required to vote.
5838,"Yep all you need to do is say a name in California. My wife asked today, "" so anyone can make up who they are?"" Ridiculous."
5839,Posts aren‚Äôt showing up in my feed. Wtf
5840,At very least at least us Republicans are speaking out about bernie being suppressed.
5841,I deleted my main multi year account with over 100K karma. Logging in with a alt to see if what I was hearing was true. Why are people still here? I don't get it. Enjoying the taste of Zyklon B or what?
5842,They created a back channel and wanted to steal the members and flood their site.  Its so fucking obvious.  They profited off the clear shawodbanning and isolating reddit created and turned it into a psyop. I honestly wouldnt be surprised if it was/is a honey pot.
5843,Yeah - go vote for the other Biden!
5844,"You know it, I know it, everybody knows it!"
5845,‚ÄúAdmin approved‚Äù lol some just can‚Äôt handle the fact we win so much and so often

5850,"I am quite disappointed in this whole T_D vs Win thing, it's now just plain bullshit with not being able to post on T_D. I was on the Win thing as a backup, thought it was a good idea. Until good mods got screwed in order to push the Win thing, now it's no longer a backup but rather controlled opposition. This is my opinion and observation as a 3 yr supporter of T_D, so if I'm gonna get banned, oh well, then I get banned. In the grand scheme of things, this is just an online forum and there a bigger fish to fry. I was so very proud of all the posters here and very impressed with the amount of younger pede's here actually standing up and knowing what the hell was going on in our government, impressive and I always commended you when the subject came up. Now a few ego's got in the fray and here we are, sad. I'm glad to have had the experience and for those of you who gave this old lady faith in the future."
5851,Try contacting the campaign.
5852,"I agree, I belong to and participate on both and always will. The fact that our mere existence here on Reddit annoys and angers the Commie Admins is enough reason for me to stay and keep posting until they burn us down completely."
5853,"You say that but I‚Äôve been using the site the last few days and I haven‚Äôt seen it be inaccurate.

There are legitimately way less comments there and less upvotes in new posts, lower activity overall."
5854,Are we not allowed to discuss Super Tuesday results on the domreddit tonight?
5855,"Fuck off, this DOMreddit is already dead/cucked.  Only even investigating admin-approved candidates means that the Commies are guaranteed to infiltrate the mod team.  Once they're in, they can open backdoors for other Commie mods, and before you know it, they'll be in the majority and removing any non-Commie mods from the mod team.

Even without that, the admins have finally shown a willingness to attack this DOMreddit and ban our biggest patriots.  If they did this now for Super Tuesday, they can/will do it again, and the next time, they'll ban every original moderator they missed in the first attack, instantly leaving this place in the admins' full control, both from the servers and from the 100%-admin-approved/controlled mod team."
5856,No matter what. Trumps going to win. Look forward to the salt mines

5864,"&gt;Reddit makes you braindead. Ever close Reddit and then immediately open it up again? How much of your time are you wasting mindlessly scrolling through content that's mostly just people making fun of ""cringey/uncool"" people.

Some of us actually use it because it's the best aggregate of content for individual video game communities."

5879,Already lots of salt to mine on [redacted]
5880,who in their right minds would support allowing illegals to vote dammit
5881,Leave it on restricted and let .win take over

5892,Not sure I can go there without my T_D for post-redacted therapy.
5893,"&gt; Communism is an absolutely failed system and I would prefer conservativism to it

5898,Reddit is asshoe
5899,"What do you mean by ""good mods got screwed to push the Win thing?"" As I understand it, the mods that got purged were purged by Reddit admins for failing to enforce their bullshit/selective rules. Reddit admins then said that they would have to hand pick new mods (i.e. infiltrate the mods here.) At that point, T_D.Win went from backup to main base of operations given T_D will soon be compromised. Reddit admins are the ones to blame, not T_D mods. I certainly wish that we could stay here as I'm not quite seeing the ""magic"" over at .win yet, but I believe that's due to how recently the community has been fractured.

If Democrats could admit that we could start fixing it. But to refer to them as some ""other"" that is responsible for all killing, is just stupid.

What's next? Shutting down POTUS 's twitter because they are a private company?"
6054,"Isn't M4A *effectively* the government seizing control of the medical industry in the US? If the government pays for everybody's healthcare and medicine, don't they control those industries? If they don't pay for a procedure, then the procedure will cease to exist. If they won't pay for an improved drug, then the drug won't get improved. If they decide that doctors make $X, and nurses make $Y . . . then that's what those professions make. That sounds like control to me.

The only portion that might remain outside government control would be the stuff that M4A wouldn't cover . . . like elective procedures, and ""extra special"" care if you can afford it. So, the parts that cater to the rich, and the super-rich.

What a near-perfect system . . . government mandated and controlled care for 95% of the population, and a rich/super-rich 5% who now self-fund their own medical research, for their use and their use *only*."

I will repeat myself for the sake of my fellow pedes.  Since I believe that reddit doesn't have the right to dictate preferences.  Who are they to tell you want you must like or not like and what is proper.  I though Reddit was a platform not a publisher.

I want to thank Reddit for the upvoting warning email.  I feel that it is my greatest privilege to receive such an honor.  It is Reddit's recognition that I'm against censorship and the throttling of information due to the influence of Reddit's Chinese investors.  I will attempt to live what little time I have left on Reddit as a free speech warrior and an upvoter in defiance of the Mods.  I want to especially thank Spez for this honor who without his sensitivity and his attention to detail this honor would not be possible.  Without his totalitarian impulses and pettiness Reddit would have had a greater level of influence and even possible reached it full potential.  I'm so overwhelmed with emotion I am almost in tears.

China, Cuba, North Korea and the Soviet bloc would call themselves democracies because people could 'participate' as long as you agreed with them. The inner party members would pick a list of 2-3 leftists and 'allow' you to pick which stooge got to control your life. Sometimes when the party got too tired putting up fake pretenses they would just pretend like only 1 person in an entire city wanted to campaign and you would get some bricks thrown into your window. Under democratic centralism once the mob votes then having a different opinion is considered treason.

This is the same 'deal' Reddit is offering. Pick from their list of socialists and hapless liberals. If you don't, then you'll be punished even more for standing by your principles. That's why so many Reddit users on politics openly defend sending Americans to gulags."

6252,"I haven‚Äôt been around enough recently to see it being spammed here, but like I said I always knew Reddit would destroy us for any reason at all, at their convenience.  That‚Äôs how I still see the quarantine situation and the admins‚Äô actions since.  The only one who intentionally destroyed us is spez and the admins.  They slowly restricted our outreach to the rest of Reddit starting with the ridiculous rule years ago that we‚Äôre the only sub not allowed on r/all.  

I guess I‚Äôm just lost as to why any of the mods here are being blamed for not complying with Reddit‚Äôs absurd restrictions on our sub.  Like oh if we just kept eating shit sandwiches eventually spez was gonna put us back on equal footing?  Lol we have so clearly not been welcome here for a long time.  I‚Äôm surprised it took this long, especially given the brutally weak reasons given (fake threats and whistleblower).  They could have done that at any time, but they chose a slow bleed.  I don‚Äôt know what other option we have other than to migrate.  We fought the good fight here, but it‚Äôs clearly over.  Apparently all the money pedes have given to Judicial Watch isn‚Äôt enough for them to make a meaningful effort to save us lol"
6253,"That really doesn't logically follow, since admins, who already control the platform, can do whatever the fuck they want anyway. They have no need for accounts."
6254,No offense to Fitton but seeing every top post be a picture of him flexing on fucking Super Tuesday is disgraceful to this sub. Someone said that the guy who started .Win is the one who shut the sub down to only approved posters?? What in the hell is going on here.
6255,"When they send us their mods, they're not sending their best."
6256,"Despite the 'M' on the account, they are no longer a mod here (but still a mod on win), and are not listed on T_D sidebar anymore. Weren't they also the one associated with the now-defunct maga.img?

I had a mod explain to me once that the reason they didn't want Q stuff posted was, not because it wasn't true, but because it was linked to the word 'conspiracy' and they didn't want to take any chances with it. I sort of understood that at the time, but if one thing breaks a rule and it's removed, it's unfair to allow other things that break them without removing them.  I don't trust any mod here, now of former.  They all have their own perspectives and reasons for their actions.

6323,"&gt; Do you know the difference between a platform and a publisher?

Yes.

&gt;Basically if you think a platform has the right to censor or remove...

Of course they do.  What would be the alternative?  That you start a platform but then you have no control over it and no ability to moderate in any way?  Why on earth would anyone bother creating a platform that they are then not allowed to control?

Think it through.  Imagine you start a platform for dog-lovers (just as an example), and then a bunch of cat-people show up and start flooding it with posts and memes about cats.  According to your insane reasoning, the person who started the dog-lover site can‚Äôt do anything about this.  They are now obligated to continue paying to host cat-related content or else complete idiots like you will whine and cry that the cat-people are being censored.  The person‚Äôs only choice would, what, to close up shop or to allow the cat-people to take over entirely?  It doesn‚Äôt make any sense.

GTFO with this nonsense please.  You don‚Äôt have a right to use someone else‚Äôs platform.  You people and your sense of entitlement is really off the charts.  

&gt;I don‚Äôt.

The ""private company"" argument that retards love to throw around without understanding is true.  They are a private company.  They can do what they want.

But when you tell me not to threaten people, and I don't, but I get warnings for ""hurtful content"" because I called you a retard, and then go over to (Politics, TMoR, whatever) and you have comments staying up calling for the extermination of all center to right thinking 'because Nazis'...there's an impossible double standard that will never go away.

And that very content policy currently contains no reference to threatening, bullying, or harassing user behavior in the section entitled ""Prohibited Behavior"".  Nor is there anything in that agreement that incorporates by reference standards or regulations contained elsewhere in the site, such as in the referenced help section.

If Reddit wishes to update its content policy to reflect new rules on user behavior in the future, fine.  Until then, I expect them to adhere to the rules that they wrote.  And as-written, unless it violates a subreddit's individual rules &amp; regulations as set by the moderators, neither behaving in a threatening, bullying, or harassing manner, nor engaging with that type of submitted content, is a violation of the rules that could subject a user to discipline.

If Reddit can't even follow it's own rules, how can they possibly expect everyone else to respect them?"

Bernie's support after South Carolina went down slightly and biden's went up because some of those people that just want Trump out switch to bite because he looks like he had the best chance to win. It doesn't really matter either way personally I'd rather see Bernie and his socialist get a resounding review but creepy Joe is a joke anyway he doesy have a prayer in a general election.

Sorry but I think it's probably in the best interests of everyone on this sub if we force reddit to ban it outright. The only reason they haven't done it is fear. 

Fear that 793,275 TD subscribers will wreak havoc all across their precious site.

6410,I will NOT  be bullied by Reddit Inc.
6411,"Reddit indeed doesn't have to bake the cake, and if you believe that the bakers shouldn't have to bake the cake then you should believe that reddit doesn't have to.

There are free speech platforms but the left seems to have cowed us out of using them out of fear that we might be called racist nazi bigots or something.

However, we already get called that regardless so what is stopping us from using them

There is Voat, Gab, Bitchute...literally ours for the taking, and with the numbers that the donald had, the literal neo-nazi ficks at those platforms would be not only reduced to a whimper, but would have maybe a couple million people embarrassing them daily."
6412,Here Here!
6413,The fact that nobody in the government is enforcing the publisher vs platform rules is what is egregious.
6414,Fuck reddit. I am here because I shit post and make leftists cry. Any other reason doesn't matter to me.
6415,"I not leaving until after November third!! 

Trump 2020"
6416,"If everyone leaves reddit will become the new Myspace.

I don't want spez as my only friend."
6417,"It is sad because Reddit has the fastest velocity for information in an understandable manner on the internet.  Out of all people, Why the reddit mods have a penchant for throttling information I will never understand.  The more information, the more innovation.  The more innovation the greater the collective wealth of the country.  

It is truly tragic and sad that the tech lords forgot how to debate and persuade people.  They choose to impose not to engage.  Banned content and ""wrongthink"" is not a winning strategy IMHO.  I won't go off on Spez because I wonder if he isn't just taking orders.  He is a millionaire not a billionaire.  Reddit is one hell of a place to surf the internet and get information way faster than almost anywhere else.  I suspect all of this tech censorship is going to backfire and have the opposite effect of what these members of clown world intend."
6418,"How isn't it, though? The worst that will happen is Trump supporters will leave. Reddit will keep getting money from China and bigoted liberal groups. There is no competing platform. Just face it, like every other liberal/democrat/communist, they can do whatever they want with no consequences."
6419,They traded all of their values for hatred.
6420,"I can‚Äôt imagine the mental gymnastics that are happening to make anyone think they are morally superior to anyone that thinks or believes anything contrary to their flawless ideals.   

I get disagreeing with people.  I even get thinking someone isn‚Äôt all there for their beliefs.  But, to underhandedly and systematically enact policies to completely silence and/or remove everyone that has an opposing view Is too closely aligned with a fascist regime for comfort.  

I wish they could see past their blind hatred for Trump and any of his followers to see that regardless of who you support, these policies are bad for everyone, regardless of your political affiliation."
6421,Thats kinda the point isnt it?
6422,Spez can suck my hairy balls. Fucking cuck
6423,Ban me you pussy. DO IT!!!!!
6424,Reddit is not the problem. It's the Donald mods. Phuc Pham. They ruined This site. They ripped the soul for it and try to make everyone move to a trailer park version. Went about as well as the Obamacare website. We need to find out who put this forum on lockdown. We need names.
6425,"Wrongthink! Minitrue!

We are here, folks."
6426,Reddit is a nice source for open discussion on anything besides politics.  The administrations political actions are close to ending my relationship with the website.
6427,"Thankfully, I'm a reasonable person and can make my own decisions."
6428,So they shut down the Donald during a Democrat primaries for money and trying to get us to go to a new website and all you guys want to pretend it's Reddit and China? Pathetic. It's these stupid mods that shut the site down not spez. I mean they beat him to it before he could ban us. F*** them. I want names of those mods that shut down the site and left it down during the primaries. Stop being f****** stupid and run into their little trailer Park website .win
6429,Reddit wants to interfere with the election since they know the Democrats cannot win unless they do so.
6430,Internal election interference
6431,Well most of the posters you see who harass people for posting on T_D are shills soooo...
6432,"What exactly were the moderation problems reported here? Every time I checked the sub I only saw typical enthusiastic ""MAGA"" content."
6433,Never saw anyone or heard being harassed in this sub. Maybe it it‚Äôs the victim-hood kicking in.
6434,"They should look at all the other leftist subreddits and ban most of them since those people are all about harrassment, bullying, and threats of violence against people who support President Trump"
6435,RIP in peace literally any of the good subs.
6436,"I'm a full on bernie supporter, hell I've donated to his ass. But it looks like the DNC is gonna rat fuck him with that cocksucker Joe so fuck it, I'm voting for Donald this November if Bernie doesn't get it."
6437,Fuck this place I'm out. The Donald.win
6438,I've got 3 warnings from Reddit so far... fuck Reddit
6439,"What is Reddit going to do when it's the DNC that fucks Bernie over yet again?  They've selled out so fucking hard for him and yet when he's not the nominee and Biden is, they're going to scream like retarded seals and blame Trump supporters. That's what they did in 2016.  It will happen again.  Seems logical."
6440,"I have seen the Fitton posts on the top for 3 days now, something is not right. Normally I check TD every 6 hrs and there will be new memes on top."
6441,Reddit will just shut down the new ones.  This place is lost.
6442,I love how Reddit is interfering with the election by suppressing us yet on the same hand bitching about supposed foreign election interference.
6443,Go away shill
6444,reasonable person = not a Trump supporter according to Reddit
6445,There's plenty of right wing subs but you need to act right when you're in there. Pandering to the left has failed. Stop being neocons. Start being properly America first.
6446,Any?
6447,"You should actually see how long you can hold it, fuckface.
Idiots like you posting here tells me that this sub is dying and has been taken over by shit Reddit mods..."
6448,Reddit can suck my fucking balls as well as all these new mods coming in.. they can also suck my balls.
6449,I got one warning and replied with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Lp-h1S3rMk)
6450,Canary is wrong. Not compromised my ass.
6451,# hey whatever happened to that fucking cunt son of his Hunter Biden who stole money for doing fuck all except for impregnating hookers?

6454,"Fuck reddit, fuck the left"
6455,"Nah nah nah, only gender neutral tears come out of reddit trannies."
6456,"I'm surprised Wikipedia doesn't blame the demise of the dinosaurs on President Trump.  At some point in the future, schools, universities and governments will have to ban access to Wikileftia.   
  
Maybe the various school closures due to COVID-19 will give remote schooling the kick start it needs, so we can end the leftists teaching our children garbage."
6457,Still your President!
6458,"Can you approve posts please? If we get banned so be it, what's the point of keeping this sub locked down? You're letting Reddit win."
6459,"#Hey Reddit, he‚Äôs still your President!"
6460,"""Reasonable"" eliminates all liberals."
6461,Trump 2020.
6462,Trump for 2020 prison
6463,"No, Reddit can suck my cock."
6464,China owns Reddit
6465,How the fuck!! Were you able to post here???
6466,Admins confirmed banned.
6467,"that would be a legendary move, i wonder if the system could be used again them?"
6468,"swore to fight?  The progressive left with their ""we're better than everyone else and everyone else must think like under penalty of law or worse mentality"" is the origin of fascism."
6469,Suck my nigger dick y'all
6470,"Wouldn't engaging in politically-biased authoritarian censorship be considered 'behaving in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit?'

In that case, shouldn't all mods who have not dissented against the quarantine of this sub be immediately banned?

Nothing discourages participation like censorship."
6471,"I get bullied and harassed if i comment on r/politics.
Im downvoted without people explaining why.  Whom do we send these screenshots to?  These responses are not behaved in a way that discourage a reasonable person from participating on reddit."
6472,"The problem is the NEW site, dot win.  It‚Äôs tedious.  It‚Äôs clunky.  And it ignores what was so special about the Donald.... it was our little clubhouse and a blue sea of shit.  It was our Indian reservation with hookers and blackjack.  And they had to deal with us."
6473,So no one can post anything anymore? **FUCK YOU CUNTS**
6474,Trying to take down my favorite sub discourages me from participating on reddit
6475,"This is so funny. We are at the elementary level of making up rules without thinking how easily they can be twisted against you. Of course they can't think about it at the moment as they see conservatives as the clear rule breakers and common enemy. But let's assume they ban us all.

Then it will be the turn of everyone who is against Bernie. Or who is against China. Or whoever is going to buy the administrators. Idiots."
6476,Yeah deputize people with 10k sub comment or link karma and a min number of posts for each. Mini mods aka Mike mods
6477,By reasonable person they mean a TDS liberal.
6478,"&gt; expect them to adhere to the rules that they wrote.

Reddit Admins:  ""Rules for T_D, not me."" 
  
This is what will eventually sway jurors to convict Reddit execs and admins when lawsuits start to go to trial.   
  
Reddit Admin: ""How did they get all that info, I thought we scrubbed the servers?""  
  
Reddit Lawyer: ""We did, but we didn't count on thousands of people diligently archiving posts.  I'm not sure how they archived the messages from moderators, they weren't *supposed* to be able to do that."""
6479,I fucking hate this place now.
6480,"Fuck this fucking site, [thedonald.win](https://thedonald.win) for the win bois."
6481,I think it needs to be done quicker as he's going to claim dimentia or old age for not remembering anything.
6482,"Top Minds subreddit:  ""Facts and Truth - we HATES them!"""
6483,"&gt; If you ""bully"" someone you will be banned. 

&gt; If you ""shut someone out of the conversation through intimidation or abuse"" you will be banned.

&gt; 2. an abusive expression or speech

------

Honest question ... (working within the defined parameters above) ... 

Aren't these parameters worded in such a way that Reddit itself can be banned?

For example: if I say I feel bullied, and shut out of the conversation in this forum - who's position is it to tell me I am wrong? Aren't my feelings MY feelings?"
6484,"The way Reddit takes it down will be part of the evidence used against them in court later on.  In the meantime, never interrupt the enemy in the middle of making a mistake."
6485,That's what he said.
6486,What do you think about Hunter Biden‚Äôs sudden interest in art?  New laundering scheme?  Crooks!
6487,#SETH
6488,So what this basically says is Spez is a pedo?
6489,? Explain yourself.
6490," Seems at least in my feed,Tom is the one of few that can post. Is Reddit scared of a lawsuit? They should be."
6491,"They quarantined us. That's how they dealt with us.

We weren't making any difference on this site since the posts were taken off the front page. Now Reddit is going to keep this sub around to keep the lazies from actually moving on.

T_D is done."
6492,Bring back the old admins. Get rid of the new ones
6493,I've always thought they took that terminology as a complement.  It's like complementing Islam for being right about women.
6494,"Don‚Äôt just leave.

Get banned from every socialist armpit sub before you go."
6495,MY RIGHTS SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED
6496,"I know. This makes my blood boil, fucking cunts."
6497,Bernie has multiple subs. Let‚Äôs make a new Donald sub!
6498,"""**reasonable person**""  


Who'd reasonably have a problem with posts on the internet that they don't have to look at, but choose to anyway?"
6499,Nobody gices a fuck about their content policy. Suck a cock you dirty commies and get ran over by a bus spez.
6500,"Though I lived in a free and Democratic country. Where freedom of opinion and thought was encouraged.

Guess I was wrong on that front.

Socialism is pretty much in total control of speech online."
6501,Then reddit is in violation of its own policy because their cancerous censorship is discouraging me from participating in this cesspool.
6502,Fuck Reddit and fuck you Spez.
6503,I'm not going over there until all the past mods put out a joint statement or hold a transparent AMA explaining whether or not that site was put up by a rogue mod.
6504,"&gt;bully

Let‚Äôs see, we‚Äôve got ‚ÄúNazi‚Äù, ‚ÄúIncel‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou post on T_D so your point is invalid‚Äù, anyone else got any others?"
6505,"Hmm...  Have they _seen_ /r/politics these days?  About 75% of the posts there, and about 90% of the comments there, are abuse directed at a person or group."
6506,Got banned from ask_the_(commie)_donald for saying ‚Äú0bongo.‚Äù
6507,No funding was cut. Rest of your rant is opinion.
6508,lol nice
6509,"So if they don't want us upvoting banned content whatever their definition, why don't we just leave comments instead?"
6510,"The idea of .win is great, and I am over there as well... However normies aren't as likely to follow us to there as they are to this sub. We can't just abandon T_D, for every shill that bullies you based on your post history there's a person who is introduced to MAGA and begins the journey of being redpilled.
Only fellow Trump supporters or Orange Man Bad trolls are on .win. That makes it great for casual shit posting and conversation, but we aren't redpilling anyone over there."
6511,Because there's speculation (and evidence) that TD is being nuked from within so that traffic can be pushed to the (monitized) TD.win.
6512,"If spez got the corona virus, I wouldn't be sad."
6513,"This is how it works in Iran. The Ayatollah pick the candidates and then you can only vote for on the approved Ayatollah-Candidates. 

This is clear election meddling by reddit. But, let them have their short-term victory. Unbeknownst to them, they are killing reddit by deviating so grossly from its founding principles.

Off to TheDonald.Win I go."
6514,What a compliment! Thanks!
6515,China is asshoe!
6516,"We would be pretty fucked and disoriented without .win

6519,Sure
6520,"I concur.

A brutal ass fucking to you, deaddit."
6521,Trump has already started down that road and from what I hear it‚Äôs making a big difference already!
6522,"""Reasonable person"" is slimy lawyer bullshit speak. I'm going to stay until they decide to ban me. With that said:

Fuck Spez

Fuck Reddit

Fuck communism

Fuck Bernie Sanders

Fuck creepy Joe Biden"
6523,Fucking communists

6526,"I look forward to /politics being wiped out, since they discourage me from even sharing an opinion"
6527,"I finally got my ""you participated in wrongthink"" message. I barely come to the site anymore but will keep posting when I do until they ban me. It's more fun to shitpost on twitter where power tripping mods living in their parents basement can't just delete my comments or lock threads once the wrongthink starts."
6528,Michael Obama is a tranny and has a penis.
6529,Might need to post this over at /politics instead.
6530,No shit??? What was your first clue???

6534,Look how unbelievably bad all the other candidates are
6535,fuck you.  ban me.  there are many places on the internet to look at porn.
6536,Probably afraid of Bernie supporters backing trump after Bernie gets screwed again. Like last time.
6537,Its the same people
6538,JD SAUSAGE FO LYFE
6539,I posted a fact about democide and was immediately banned from r/socialism.  So it only cuts one way....
6540,Not on the .win
6541,RICH
6542,"What happens when Reddit management behaves in a way that makes me not want to participate here?

After a decade, I find myself less interested in participating here because of the harassment I‚Äôve taken from non TD users."
6543,The site is dead. Thedonald.win
6544,"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself before the villain"
6545,"Reddit, blow me"
6546,Banning all their users.  It is a bold strategy.  Let's see how it works out for them.
6547,"Ah, they implemented Clown Rules - Install Vague Laws, where the interpretation of said Laws are so open, they can legally ban you for breathing Oxygen, consequently creating a social acceptance that the Law is so broke, Anarchy is the only solution.   Dumb cunts."
6548,"Oh for sure.  We are all also 

Racist, homophobic, xenophobic, islamophobic, sexist, rapists, deplorable, irredeemable, white supremacists, privileged, dotards, trumptards, trumpkins, trumpettes, hicks, inbred, hillbillies, incestuous, being a ""cis"" person.

Anyone got any more?"
6549,No thanks to installing Reddit plants.
6550,Is this where Biden got dog faced pony soldier from??
6551,"It's time to get off the ""woe is me"" train and time to start pressuring our administration and our president to do something about it.

6552,"‚ÄúReasonable‚Äù, I.e. a college educated news fed liberal."
6553,Triggered üòÜ.  Enjoy the landslide you communist fuck!
6554,"Does anyone think these rules are a tad hypocritical, or at the very least, applied to only one side of the political spectrum?

Was the night before the coup, when all through the land.

Not a backbone was stirring, not even a man.¬†

The collusion was laid, by the court without care.

In hopes that Killary, soon would be there.

The Dems were nestled all snug in their heads, while visions of Maddow danced in their heads.

And Strzok in his SCIF, Lisa Page taking notes.¬†

Had just settled their brains for an election night poke.

When out in the booths arose such a clatter.

CNN checked the poles, to see what was the matter.

Away to the vote, we flew like a flash.

Leaving work early, to vote out the past.

The tear in my eye, fell on flyover snow.

As the rigged elections, were dealt a serious blow.

When, what to joy came up from below.¬†

But an orange skinned man, constitution in tow.

Giving them the rope needed, so lively and quick,¬†

I knew in a moment this Trump man was slick.

More rapid than eagles, Meuller made moves out of fear.¬†

And when he was done, the truth still came clear.

Now Graham! Now, Gowdey! Now, Nunes! Now, Crenshaw!¬†

On, Bongino! On, Solomon! On, Tucker! On, Hannity and Undercover Huber!

To the top of the swamp! Lets bring it down fast.

Drain away all the scum, and whip the Dems ass!

Their timeline, their lies.

Nothings adding up

The average american,

Has just had enough.

6557,I finally got my warning in my inbox. Feels great.
6558,"Stop questioning, Kulak."
6559,A sane person wouldn't either. These people are nuts and anti-science.
6560,Fuck Reddit
6561,"The more you give, the more they'll take.  You could obey every single fucking rule, and they'll start pushing the boundaries looking for new ones.

Come to  [The Donald WIN](https://www.thedonald.win/) .  It's already starting to look like this place did in 2016, and you won't have to worry about when the next shoe will drop."
6562,I haven‚Äôt gotten any warnings yet...weird
6563,"Might be the app im using or the fact that were quarantined, but if you go on his profile it doesn't list this sub as one he's moderating."
6564,"So here is your first mistake. You are thinking logically here with that question. For Reddit, there is no logic."
6565,Reported you though. Rule 6
6566,Not to mention the massive nerve death that occurs from circumcision etc.
6567,I still didn‚Äôt get one. üò™
6568,I'm sure you'll get your action ribbon soon friend. Just keep at it.
6569,"""behave in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit""

So when are the admins going to ban themselves?"
6570,I think it‚Äôs whoever is the current top mod. I also believe they would rather post there so they get increased traffic and this sub slowly dies which is sad.
6571,Reddit is the a Gestapo of the internet.
6572,Lol
6573,"I got temporarily suspended for calling a left-winger a Nazi. I reported people who call me Nazi and nothing happens to the them.

Reddit runs like our 2 tiered justice system. If you area democrat you can do whatever fuck you want."
6574,I support President Donald Trump.
6575,"There are only two genders.   

Âè™ÊúâÂÖ©Á®ÆÊÄßÂà•"
6576,"Oh yea? FUCK the Democratic Party, the Chinese, and all other totalitarian organizations. And fuck reddit too."
6577,When will you apply these rules to other subs?
6578,"Fuck these commie faggots.

It's blatantly obvious what they're doing. Sleepy Joe Biden is going to steal the  nomination, as a way to protect himself and all those around him, because then they will start screaming when investigations progress and the NEED to keep the real info squelched. 

I have a feeling once Trump is reelected, he'll have ""much more flexibility"" and the gloves come off.

Term 1 = policy change

Term 2 = drainage"
6579,So does Reddit get warnings from Reddit for harassing r/The_Donald?
6580,I havent gotten any either after these new rules. Only one 3 day ban about 2 months ago before all this started.
6581,It's way past time for something to replace reddit.   slashdot-&gt;digg-&gt;reddit-&gt;??
6582,"From now on when we see someone say foreign election, we shouldn't call them a retard but should rather say something akin to ""and what about domestic election interference like social media?"""
6583,this is gold üòéüëç
6584,"I'm on a mission for my updoot warning

And I'm not going anywhere, even after they ink my digital wrist. I'm making my stand all the way down to the last second in the gas chamber."
6585,I‚Äôm banned
6586,"As far as I‚Äôve heard, they‚Äôre only banning people for UPVOTING content. I can still go anywhere I want and downvote to my heart‚Äôs desire."
6587,ü§°üåç
6588,Upvoting this post will get you banned.
6589,"He's a pedophile. He wouldn't have anything to do with your hairy balls. But, fuck him anyway."
6590,That's the point. They want us and our values to just disappear.
6591,"Pretty sure it actually influences elections, what they are doing. Sure- your idea is already made, buy in the months remaining, lots of people could have been exposed to different opinions and views"
6592,Holier than thou much?
6593,"The best reason to be an early adapter to .win

Every site starts somewhere. Let's be the beginning of the new movement. Don't let the Reddit admins turn this in to a play pen for MAGA supporters too lazy to find a new platform."
6594,"F it.  I'm upvoting what I want till they ban me.

This ""policy"" is only to spread fear and intimidate Trump voters."
6595,Pretty idiotic theory to anyone that has been paying attention to the way reddit has shut us down here little by little.
6596,Fakest story I‚Äôve read in a while.
6597,Is this China?
6598,Thank you for your deep argument and thoughtful opinion
6599,During downtime he can show us how to do curls. At that point it‚Äôll just be the fit network.
6600,You'll have all those tolerant liberals for friends tho.
6601,Reddit can wax my balls
6602,Yeah theyre fags. Ban this cocksuckers.
6603,"In before thread is locked.  

I'm Proud To Support President Donald Trump."
6604,Just delete the board. Better to not have it than hand it over to the admins.
6605,"I guess this doesn't apply to the verbal abuse I get each time I voice an opposing viewpoint in support of our president. Been called ""dumbass"" and other bames but I don't see any of them geting banned for the name-calling."
6606,Reddit admins are a bunch of faggots.
6607,"KEK &lt;---- THIS ONE

KEK

6608,The socialists are the most vicious with all this stuff. I never post in /politics because they're all so nasty.
6609,when can we start suing?
6610,"Wow, reddit has fought hard to become an extension of the communist party of china."
6611,You realise it was debunked as russian Propaganda? Turkey has done more to defeat isis than most nations
6612,You are fools this will be your demise. This censorship of conservatives will not survive and it will not stop the greatest president in a long time from being elected again. It will be your loss for sure reddit. Trump 2020. I have only upvoted positive Trump posts not one thing would do what you claim to be banning for and I get a warning. So moronic
6613,"This is going to destroy the site. I've seen very good jokes get removed that were top comments in mainstream subreddits about cars and woodworking. Anything slightly off color or perceived as ""sexist"" gets removed and users banned.  They are committing website suicide."
6614,It‚Äôs almost like you have to have the big gey for Spez to like you
6615,Are you fucking kidding me. The only ones breaking the rules on reddit or The Donald HAS been leftists.
6616,"lmfao holy shit, you people really are self-victimizing pussies."
6617,They can ban deez fucking nuts.
6618,I rule for me and another for thee.....sounds fair..lol
6619,Cucked Shill
6620,"Fuck you people who run reddit, fuck you."
6621,"&gt; Keep licking those corporate boots, bro.

Nah, you're the real corporate bootlicker.  You continue to use  services provided by a corporation that you think is censoring you. 

You don't have the fortitude to boycott and you clearly are incapable of starting a competing service--so you'll continue to use the ones you purport not to like.  Like a pathetic little bitch-boy.

All the while, you'll whine and cry about how unfair it is, because you have a pathological victim-complex and massive sense of entitlement too.

Seriously, you Trump supporters are a laughingstock, the punchline to every joke."
6622,Fuck reddit.  They‚Äôre unreasonable.
6623,"Go fuck yourselves, Admins."
6624,So what about r/politics? They just don‚Äôt screen that sub?
6625,Same
6626,"We post on T_D, therefore our privilege prevents our feelings from being sueable."
6627,Ahhh another one of Spez‚Äôs footstools
6628,Reddit admins: Please go play a nice game of hide and go fuck yourselves. Thanks.
6629,"But only for a couple more months, then the bern will cuck to either Biden or boomerburg and it'll become a bannable offense to not support whoever the designated loser is."
6630,"What fucking horseshit 

Us Trump supporters and conservatives are the most harassed people on Reddit.

Hey spez, how's it feel to sell out to China like a pussy?"
6631,"People need to see the writing on the wall. If they are marking you as potentially problematic on a social media outlet, be prepared for what they will do once they get in power. It will have real world, real life consequences. Keep you and yours safe."
6632,"Seriously. Like, are we going to preserve the perpetual form of Greco-Christian culture? Or are we going to be old liberals who haven't changed with the time?

On social issues, modern conservatism is barely distinguishable from the far left of the '80s. How about we start standing up for timeless values?"
6633,"This is gay, fuck you cunts"
6634,The death of reddit. I love to see it
6635,"Ladies and gentlemen, your Democratic nominee!"
6636,"Same here, it's a joke. I'm sure they will get many people to fall in line, I rather like to think many of us, my self included would rather get banned then told how to think."
6637,"Ok, boomer. Licking their boots by taking advantage of their service for free, thanks to ad blockers, and making a nuisance of myself by pushing ideas the admins dislike, right."
6638,"I support Trump. I enjoyed The Apprentice. Rule 3, the frog is racist."
6639,"Imagine banning people over which presidential candidate they like.

This post was made by T_D gang."
6640,The meltdown of Bernie getting smoked last night was glorious. These idiots actually think Reddit isn‚Äôt an ideological liberal bubble.
6641,"Fact.
Donald John Trump is the 45th President of the United States of America.
13 more years minimum, please and thank you."
6642,"&gt;behave in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit


So they banned leftism?"
6643,"&gt;i'm not even American and i am bullied constantly on other subs, just because i made a few comments on The_Donald.

I always carry this around with me on reddit. Hope it will be as useful for you as it was for me: https://i.imgur.com/tSro6Z8.png"
6644,Because nobody has started contacting reddit's advertisers and asking them why they advertise on a porn site yet. That's what crippled tumblr.
6645,‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident that Reddit could sway elections‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt do it of course. And I don‚Äôt know how many times we could get away with it. if we really wanted. I‚Äôm sure Reddit could have swayed at least this election this once.‚Äù ‚Äî Hitler
6646,"I'm sure there will be a slew of subreddits that will be immune to this rule. I'll post them here and we'll see how ""impartial"" reddit is."
6647,Fuck Spez
6648,"So what youre saying is, someone convinced you ""a reasonable person"" to stop coming to reddit? Sounds like they broke terms of service üòÇ"
6649,"&gt; Ahhh another one of Spez‚Äôs footstools

LMAO you're here too, dummy. 

You are far more of a footstool than I could ever be, considering you're still here *despite* that you think you're being censored or treated unfairly.  

You're here licking spez's boots despite that you think he's mistreating you.  You can't get more pathetic if you tried."
6650,"1. Post a pro Bernie meme on a site where you can edit the picture.

2. Use an alt to post a link to that to that picture on a major sub, wait for upvotes.

3. Change it to a pro Trump meme. 

4. Profit!"
6651,Reddit is asshoe
6652,I think it's probably obvious that they keep a history of edits.
6653,Me either lol
6654,do extreme vetting so extreme that it could take another 5 years...
6655,I support President Donald Trump.
6656,"So we should all go on the cuck subs professing our love for trump.  Let the hate ensue, and hold them to their standard."
6657,I was permantly banned feom /r/conservative for the factual statement that right wing terrorism is worse than left wing at the moment. It goes both ways.
6658,I SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP.
6659,This information is discouraging me from participating on reddit.
6660,I'm just here for my scarlet letter
6661,What a stupid fucking post. This sub has gone to shit. I am starting to think the mods that are left are reddit shills. No more high energy. Just day old posts with loser content.
6662,"I‚Äôm staying until this publisher bans me for upvoting a picture of Adolf Spezler. 

Also gonna make a burner, post trump 2020 in politics then just report all the rulebreaking replies. Can‚Äôt wait to see 0 bans handed down by the admins."
6663,I finally got my reddit warning for upvoting!
6664,"There must be some mistake: define ‚Äúreasonable person‚Äù???   

LOL, Redditors are unreasonable snowflakes!!!!"
6665,I support President Donald Trump. Also He's your President too lol
6666,"Accounts are free. Ban me. I don't give a fuck. It's much easier for them to stamp out a  subreddit like they have here than it is to stamp out the userbase of the subreddit. 

They always had the right to ban me for any reason. I don't care what their TOS says at all."
6667,Please....we all know who it is for. They can pretend it is for all subreddits but their main target is The Donald. What a bunch of pretentious cowards....
6668,Fuck off you fat bitch
6669,"I‚Äôm banned from numerous subs. They cannot tolerate any dissent nor friendly debate; if you do not subscribe to leftist ideology, your value is null."

6679,Do NoT tHrEaTeN oR buLlY
6680,Fuck reddit
6681,Well I‚Äôd be interested in seeing if their rules apply both ways. I can‚Äôt count the number of times ive gotten a DM from some lunatic telling me to die or mocking me for something I posted in the bowels of a world news post. I‚Äôm always civil online and I‚Äôd be interested in seeing if reddit will censor the hard core commies.
6682,"&gt; Ok, boomer.

Good try, but you're only off by multiple decades.  As for you, you're still a teenager living with your parents, aren't you?  That's what your inane comments suggest.

&gt;Licking their boots by taking advantage of their service for free

Hey, that's the same thing I'm doing.  See, if I'm a bootlicker, so are you and all the other Trump cultists here.  Thanks for admitting it, bro!

6714,"It says T_D is not compromised, but all I see are days old posts with tons of upvotes but no comments on them. No new posts and memes at all. T_D is dead in reddit."
6715,"FUCK REDDIT!
EAT MY DICK LIBERALS!"
6716,Sounds like it's time to clean some null pointers in our program.
6717,"After Trump wins I have no need to be here. 

I will spend the rest of my time watching Youtube reruns of Liberals screaming and triggered on CNN and MSNBC"
6718,"Do you know who else tried not to 'behave in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating?'

6723,"Please, President Trump, hear the voices of American citizens banned from polite society for supporting the President of the United States of America. That is our only crime. Fuck Reddit!"
6724,"This was what I was going to ask about.  So, this rule only applies to T_D supporters.  It's typical liberal ""rules for thee, but not for me"" policy.  If you're a Dem you can store classified info on a private server, destroy evidence after receiving a subpoena, lie to the FBI and Congress, demand quid pro quo from allies in exchange for release of aid, and be free to express yourself on what's supposed to be a public platform...all without consequences.  If you're conservative - you go to jail, get impeached, get suspended or banned.

Sure, we can walk away from Reddit.  We have a place to go to have freedom of speech, but it seems to me that if we could prove their double standard, we'd have a class action lawsuit."
6725,Woo hoo! I feel like I‚Äôm playing Russian Roulette with this profile Reddit thinks I give a fuck about.
6726,Imagine what they would do if they had *actual* power
6727,Reddit Admin should ban themselves out of existence based on these rules
6728,"Oh no, oh dear. People making unsavory comments on the internet! How dare they! Come on lads, let's all clutch our pearls together. The horror!"
6729,"I'm wondering how long the special treatment will last, now that the Bernie shirts have learned they can brigade their own posts to the front page, and don't have to buy advertising time from Reddit anymore."

6748,"The rules are insane because I see nothing but a chain reaction of posters in other subs harass trump supporters and bully them. I am open to other people‚Äôs political views and ideas, but when you are effectively allowing the rules to only apply to the group that‚Äôs constantly on the receiving end of abuse it makes a pretty powerful statement on where Reddit stands. 

It baffles my mind too because from a business standpoint you are effectively wiping out a large demographic."
6749,"yeah this policy is BS I've had people harass and messages me privately to do so, even reported me for their own harassment lol, but Reddit tried to ban me!"
6750,I support President Donald Trump

6757,the japanese are better anyways. kek
6758,Trump needs to intervene against the regressive leftist corruption already.
6759,Reddit killed this sub because they can't stand people who think differently from them. There's only like 2 posts on this sub a day thanks to the cucklords themselves
6760,"Please, those zionist pigs are no different than this Bolshevic site. Many post are taken down there for wrong think."
6761,"Around 2016 there was a wiki page on Hitler's economy in Germany and other information about Hitlers views. 

There was a specific section with quotes from Hitler and a summary of some of his views. Someone edited the page and removed any evidence that showed Hitler was pro socialist. 

There was a quote that Hilter told one of his officers something along the lines of ""why do we need to socialize banks and factories when we can socialize human beings"" 

He talks more about his view of socialism etc. It was all removed without any reasoning. I tried to fight against it but I am a wiki noob and after a few attempts I just gave up because I have a life and a career. Sadly there are these pathetic people out there with nothing else to do. Or they are getting paid by bad actors to influence the masses."

6764,"My account confuses the algorithm so that's probably why I've been safe. 

When I was younger and didn't understand economics and reality as well I was for Sanders so I have some activity in that subreddit. Thankfully before the Generals in 2016, I woke up and have been a member here and was able to vote for Trump. 

I actually realized I am probably more so a libertarian and only yearn for the minimal amount of government required because really they can't do anything well."
6765,"&gt; Pretty sure the new rules only apply to ""quarantined"" subs.

*For now...*"
6766,"Reddit, take a look at your ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù sub. That festering wound discourages many reasonable people from participating. If you have an idea that‚Äôs slightly less left leaning than the mob, you‚Äôre thrown to the wolves.

Hope you‚Äôre happy, Reddit. You‚Äôre doing a wonderful job at making this site a perfect, sanitary, liberal paradise. You‚Äôve cut out the voices of half the American population. No reasonable person is participating in a massive echo chamber. 

Now, when Trump wins 2020, the left is going to have a break down worse than 2016 because they don‚Äôt see a single person on their favorite social media site that supports Trump and they can‚Äôt understand how it happened."

6770,"And these same people have the gall to invoke Orwellian 1984 imagery when decrying the agenda of President Trump. The complete lack of self-awareness of these fucks is astounding. We have an entire class of narcissistic, overly-socialized, cosmopolitan midwits who are convinced that their academic degree and clout among progressive social circles entitles them to act like insufferable school marms. They will deprecate and torment anybody whose viewpoints don't align with their politically-correct, middle-management office culture. The entire mindset is not only FAKE AND GAY, it's FRAUDULENT. These people deserve nothing but ridicule. Make sure you laugh in their face and tell them to fuck off."

P.S. If we seem pissed off ""hate filled"" at the current faggotry taking place here in T_D and in America in general.. Its because WE ARE and rightfully so. 

Here you have to sugar coat everything or remain silent in order to avoid a suspension or ban. At .win you can shout DEUS VULT and remind people why 2A exists and not worry about a ban from commie cucked admins."
6774,I report the warnings for targeted harassment.  Fuck em.
6775,"Hey. Guess what. The Donald.win banned me. The admins might be posers. Used liberal slurs in private mesg. To me. Insulting also. Nonetheless I only was posting info about covid19 relationship to 5G ..and it's real danger apparently.. judge your self and pass it on faithful pede!üëçüö®

Wow. Ok then. Have fun with your dazzling rhetorical skills, bro.

No way I can complete with such dazzling rhetoric like ""you are a corporate bootlicker"" and ""ok boomer"".  You are really on a whole other level with that kind of dazzling rhetoric.  

This kind of dazzling display is really emblematic of Trump supporters in general.  It's hysterical to see you pretend that anyone should be taking you seriously when this is the best you can muster."
6800,Fuck those pinko commies

6813,"I can see the difference. I am talking about the right and identity politics in general. The right complains about how the left labels themselves, only care about race and gender, and vote based on race. Yet, at the same time you guys put people like Joel Patrick, Jack Brewer, the Hodgetwins, and other black conservatives on a pedestal solely because of their race. If they were white, y‚Äôall wouldn‚Äôt make a big deal out of them. Same goes with #BLEXIT. It‚Äôs playing into the same race game the left-leaning media does. It‚Äôs all bullshit and you can‚Äôt have it both ways. Also, please keep in mind that I‚Äôm not defending the people who called him an ‚Äúuncle tom‚Äù or a race traitor.

6822,"Let‚Äôs try this!

Reddit admins got rid of the mods because their Chicom pimps offered then more cock then they usually get to take

Oh yeah - Sanders is a communist"
6823,"I'm sure you know, but just in case - Reddit is an ideologically controlled forum. It is a pay to create news ""social"" website, where the highest bidders (if globalist/dem/NWO aligned) can try to help create reality. It is MSM's social kitten, just like MSMTube, I mean Youtube. But there is no You in it."
6824,"This is hilarious, can pretty much ban every NPC on Reddit in their echo chamber anti-America news commentary.

Lets see... I'm guessing this new rule will apply to conservatives and not the echodumbs..."
6825,Fuck yiu
6826,"As a Canadian watching from the sidelines here is my two cents. What they are doing here is using a policy based on fantasy trying to stop an inevitable outcome in the face of futility. I feel like I am watching someone standing on a railroad bridge holding a plastic shield yelling at a train and every time someone tries to reason with them to get out of the way they walk further onto the bridge out of reach. I feel bad for them having been lied to for so long on so many subjects and unfortunately this is what it has all come to.
Stay strong my Southern neighbors for without you we would not be able to get away with the shit we do up north for long. My freedom is based on your freedom."
6827,I got the warning too... but I literally had to spend 2 days upvoting every post on the Donald... It was hard but I earned my stripes.
6828,"I imagine that social scoring as the Chinese do it is only a few years away.  

Land of the free and home of the well behaved."
6829,You got a warning for this?! I still need mine. Reddit admins line up behind me for a human centipede.
6830,They‚Äôre going to be pissed about Commissar Sanders loss last night. They‚Äôll probably try to take it out on us somehow.
6831,"So just to clarify, if I call all the reddit admins and 99% of its user base a bunch of limp-wristed pinko commie faggots, I‚Äôll get banned?"
6832,This is the end of Reddit. If I knew how to code I would be working on a viable replacement...
6833,"Which is why we should just let the sub free.  Rather than die a slow death, why not explode out with one final push that forces reddit's hand into banning us?  It would capture national headlines, it would gain normie interest in thedonald . win.  It would let the sub actually be dank again.  The last year or so has been awful to the quality of the sub.  The memes are all recycled.  We are even seeing boomer comics making their way up to the top.  Let the sub explode in a flurry of activity and put the ball in Reddit's court.  They want to get rid of us, they'll have to do it openly and publicly."

6836,"You mad, bro?"
6837,"Remember a few months back when the mods posted logs of what the Admins were actively removing from our sub for content violation, and the removed posts were mostly political criticism and discussion of Joe Biden? 

I member. 

The Admins are not your friends, and they have an agenda. The rules are only there to give them an excuse to carry out literally any morally reprehensible action that they want."
6838,"And then make new accounts, and get banned again.

When I can't post, I select the next account on my list and post whatever it was I trying to post"
6839,I received an automated warning for commenting on and/or upvoting content Reddit deemed to be against the rules. What I find insane about this is that no explanation was given of what exactly violated the rules. How is a user supposed to know what they did wrong if it isn't specifically spelled out? Absolutely nuts.
6840,I don't believe for a minute that they would let a system that could be used against them apply to their communist echo chambers.
6841,How about the 10 minute timer for not being a communist?
6842,"But no reasonable person would be on Reddit at this point, because it's nothing but unhinged libtards who have no respect for others, and they think freedom of speech is hate speech. You can't reason with the unreasonable."

6851,Wdym bye? I can‚Äôt get banned lol
6852,"I can explain it.  It doesn't matter who gets the votes, it matters who counts the votes.  Remember all of the green election boxes in Miami that were being moved during the 2008 election?  How about voter turnout in excess of 100%.  I'm not saying it couldn't happen.  But if you look up the historical average and suddenly it's 40% higher, it does look suspicious.  You don't have to control all of it, just enough."
6853,If you need to censor opposition to your ideas...your ideas suck
6854,"Do not threaten harass or bully. But that‚Äôs what you only ever encounter in this website as a Trump supporter, what a fucking joke.

Wish the mods around here would grow a pair and just nuke the subreddit instead of dealing with this bullshit."
6855,"We have moved to https://TheDonald.win

6892,They got all that China money in order to do it and make it a sound business decision. Biden is obviously more popular with Democrats (just look at the results from yesterday) but reddit is hugely pro Sanders. Maybe it's because Sanders is a commie piece of shit and that appeals to China.
6893,that sucks that this subreddit won't be around to influence the 2020 election season. seeya!

No one on this sub gives a rats ass about reddit's ""community standards"" because they don't apply to every community.  Open this sub back up and force Reddit's hand.  We actually still hold the cards, so why aren't you letting us play them?  Why are you letting Reddit win?"
6953,"Two terms, two scoops, and... two tabs. Fuck reddit and China especially for ruining this place.

6956,"Careful about it ‚Äî there's at least one sub where questionable OC was posted to, lots of folks pointed it out, and all of their comments were deleted for wrong think, whereas the OC itself was left alone.

Censorship doesn't work. People form opinions based on healthy debate. I was always polite on politics and news yet I was banned for wrong think.

Remember when it seemed for a while that Roy Moore was going to lose the Alabama Senate race to a democrat, because he's a fucking paedophile, but then to the surprise of all the liberals who thought Republicans still had decency, it turned out that they're completely willing to stand behind our guy.

Well congrats democrats on proving yourselves no fucking better. Congrats on proving that you're willing to elect someone whose behaviour around women is comparable to that of Jimmy fucking Saville. Congrats on proving that some borderline dementia patient who stands for absolutely nothing, and probably isn't even sane enough to run for president is your choice.

But y'know, every democratic darling was completely unfit for presidency. National Service Pete, aka mr ""I get funding from the state department and CIA, and will likely bomb and coup any country I'm told to"", Bloomberg, for whom apparently stop and frisk programs are ""discriminatory towards whites"" because in his vision of a world your skin colour is a crime(Who has 40 outstanding sexual harassment cases by the way, because systemic rape and misogyny is what our entire civilisation is built on). Biden was the tip of the fucking iceberg for these people.

In any sane democracy, the fact that there's any chance of two sex-pests barely able to form coherent sentences running against each other would be absurd.

The so called ""Moderate Democrat"" is a hate-driven ideological extremist who will rally behind their fashy leaders just the same as the alt-right. They try and smear us as hateful extremists and ideologues because it's sheer projection. They know full well they have no conviction, an inability to compromise, and hate for anyone who disagrees with them.

It's well known that fascists have a tendency to fall in line behind their leaders right and wrong because they're driven more by hate and insecurity in their position on social hierarchy. Well congrats on proving yourselves as fascists, you liberal scumbags. You've proven that you hate us leftists so much that you will rally behind Joe Fucking Biden, who is by all metrics the most incompetent leader you could, just to spite us and to maintain your fucking starbucks lattes and wall street yuppie jobs.

The far-left on the other hand splinters itself a hundred times over minor ideological differences. Do you know why?, Because we actually fucking care, we actually believe in something. We're the ones who are willing to compromise on our positions out of pragmatism, we're the ones who are willing

I'm sick and fucking tired of the sheer vitriol and hate I get for being one of the few ACTUALLY moderate people out here. Because the far-left IS the moderate, yet every single time I try and compromise my position and rally behind a candidate half-way between my beliefs and the status quo, I get treated like an invader whose destroying your parties from the inside, and  responsible for all your problems.

I'm fucking tired of the vitriol liberals have towards leftists, to the extent that they'll back Joe Biden just to fucking spite us, blame us on their inevitable loss to Trump, claim w'ere invading THEIR party that they apparently have a god-given right to maintain as the status quo, and treating us like toxic trash to be discarded because we don't support the murder of Yemeni children, or people dying from lack of healthcare.

You know whose going to win this election if it comes between Biden and Trump?, Saudi Arabia. Because our only chance of having a president who actually wants world peace will be fucking ruined.

Dear Liberals, Dear Biden Voters: You may start noticing that you're being haunted by the ghosts of dead Yemeni children, bombed in the ongoing total war waged by Saudi Arabia which makes no distinction between civilians and military personnel.

Any future wars in the Middle East are your fault. Our continued support of Saudi Arabia in their genocidal campaign will be your fault. The next refugee crisis will be your fault. That's what you get for not voting for peace. You get bombed children.

As a pacifist, I have to say: I fucking hate all of you. All of you are as bad as George W fucking Bush. The CIA are going to keep building up unlimited, unquestioned power to terrorise American citizens with, countries you can't even point out on a map will get invaded.

Enjoy the slow decline in to tyranny that the US has been facing for decades now. Hope you enjoy being spied on by the NSA. And when the time finally comes that all the war and poverty and climate disaster is too much, and the National Guard start arresting dissidents on the street, because of the unchecked power of authoritarian warmongers is what causes all that fucking shit: You could have stopped this, but instead you chose to be fascists."

7114,"Sorry for the late response. I figured this would be a long post so I put off making it.

I don't believe the Old Testament is ""irrelevant post Jesus."" I think you're misunderstanding Scripture. St. Paul says that ""all scripture is inspired  and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness"" ([2 Timothy 3:16](https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm)). More importantly, Christ says ""do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the prophets, I have come not to abolish them, but to fulfill them ([Matthew 5: 17](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm)) There are specific passages in the New Testament where the Old Testament dietary law and the law on circumcision are dispensed for non-Jews, but that does not make the Old Testament irrelevant. I think the core of Leviticus is about keeping ourselves holy because God is Holy, which is something that is still relevant even if particular ritual details of it were only pertinent to Jews in the Old Covenant, not to Gentile Christians after the Resurrection.

There's a lot of good and authoritative teaching the Old Testament that should not be discarded, and understanding the Old Testament is vital for understanding Jesus. As Jerome says ""Ignorance of Scripture is ignorance of Christ"". As an aside, that is related to TC's post, Jerome struggled a lot with temptations against chastity. He was a monk and he had many impure thoughts, so when faced with these thoughts he studied Hebrew, Greek and Latin. Eventually he became so proficient in these languages (though I think Latin was his native Language), that he was commissioned to translate the Bible directly into Latin from the original languages (the previous Latin Bible was translated from the Greek, meaning that many books were originally written in Hebrew, translated to Greek and then translated again from Greek into Latin which is less accurate than a direct translation would be). [https://www.reasons.org/explore/blogs/reflections/read/reflections/2016/11/01/christian-thinkers-101-a-crash-course-on-st.-jerome](https://www.reasons.org/explore/blogs/reflections/read/reflections/2016/11/01/christian-thinkers-101-a-crash-course-on-st.-jerome). Back to my main point, it is important for Christians to appreciate the books of the Old Testament, to pray with them and study them, and it is important to find mentoring from somebody that understands them (same goes for the New Testament)."

You argued with a shill, who then logged onto his 2 other accounts to argue with you some more making you think you were arguing with 3 people.

7225,Reddit has no problem with you going to TheDonald.win they won't even delete the URL of a competing knock-off platform that uses their proprietary design. Think about it.
7226,Yeah they do.
7227,Reddit is a good example of what a far-left/communist society would look like
7228,"In not clown world, they would."
7229,"Oh look, an unlocked thread! So kind of our overlords to let us roll the dice and write something that could be censored at their pleasure."
7230,"&gt;behaving in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit crosses the line.

So basically Reddit Admins should ban themselves..."
7231,"Well, Reddit allows posting TheDonald.win URL all over this site and doesn't delete it or filter it out. Reddit lawyers haven't sent cease and desist letters to the .win site owners or their internet host yet to shut that place down for blatant proprietary design infringement. Do the math."
7232,"Ah but thats where you're wrong. Ask yourself, who is their target market, or better yet who is their paying customer? Follow the money.  Better yet follow the *power*."
7233,"Reddit can suck my fat one. Their gestapo tactics of opposing political views is very self revealing. Fortunately, we got thedonald.win now."
7234,"I‚Äôm mostly just here in the interest of getting accurate accounts from all sides, I don‚Äôt even specifically endorse any candidate or take any hardline political stances except making hardcore fun of Stalin dick-riders, but I‚Äôm fully prepared to try to log on one day and learn that I‚Äôve been thought-police‚Äôd."
7235,Unfortunately the rest of reddit isn't a place for discussion or constructive arguments either. It does not matter how many citations you provide or how many generalizations you disprove. Their minds are made before they even read your comments

7237,"Hey its perfectly fine if it supports their ideas, not ours. Were the bad one remember?"
7238,"This. Don‚Äôt surrender. Fight back. Get the media involved.

There is right and wrong and there is convenient.


Let‚Äôs say I just finished a long desert hike and I am really thirsty. Dying of thirst. 

I spot 2 bottles of water. One is on top of a building   that can access via jumping on a dumpster and making my way up the fire escape. It made by a company that treats its employees and the environment well.


I spot another bottle of water. Its on a vendor stand that I can just walk up to and grab. But, the vendor works his employees to death for meager pay dumps waste into the river.

Which bottle of water do I go for? The morally good one, or the convenient one? 

Reddit is convenient because I get news , useful  info, and have interesting conversations on a variety of topics all in a well designed (Apollo ) mobile app. 

But I don‚Äôt agree with some of Reddit‚Äôs practices.

thedonald.win has one small slice of the total content I want, and it runs on an ok designed Web site that I can access on my browser. So far , I‚Äôve had no problem with it, but it isn‚Äôt as convenient nor does it have the variety of information Reddit has.

So which do I choose?"
7239,"&gt;If you ""behave in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit"" - you will be banned.  
  
  
All current and former Reddit Admins need to be banned then."

Let them come. When their arrows fall we will shield and bask under the shade... for we fought for freedom and integrity. And they are the oppressors and champions of no-reason. 

Remember the 300. They never wavered. No compromise.  

Freedom can never be silenced. Let them dig their own grave. Every time they ban, in mass scale, it is recorded. Nothing leaves the internet. When they silence many... only their oppression will be seen more clearly. 

So stay true to your own conscience. Stay true to your values. Because they are superior to reddits. That basically means don‚Äôt be an arsehole. Because we never were. They are the arseholes. They are the totalitarians.

And wouldn‚Äôt downvoting someone for their conservative views, since this relates to a karma decrease which in turn makes it hard to participate, also fall under discouraging participation?  Or is it only if it discourages a liberal that these rules are applied?"

Screw you Reddit. Double standard PoS website."
7289,"Interesting!  I basically just assume everybody is a robot or NPC and maybe an actual lurker person or two might read it and if it's a good argument it might change their mind a little bit.

Reddit is such bullshit because this kind of gaming is not hard to detect on the admin side.  Like you'll get banned real quick on hackernews if you try to do a voting ring, even if you use separate mobile/isp/vpn IPs and religiously keep them separated (not like HN isn't even more of a bubble though).  

They just don't care, or they want it.  At least until this technological tyranny is balanced out I see it as a duty to vote against it even though historically I'd be slightly left of center.  Google especially is really the greatest threat to the country since the cold war."

His family needs to pull him already. The dude is clearly not well. But they keep pushing his campaign. I don‚Äôt know who would vote for him after all the confusion he‚Äôs had lately.

7360,"The catch to that is that you have to say an election when no one is aware that you are doing it.  Information is like water, it slips out through the cracks.  Contrary, to what the elites think, the American people are not stupid (okay some of us are).  Reddit is just raising the issue by doing the censorship and shadow banning.  In an era where you can create throwaway accounts, I am not sure Reddit has the power to lock the information in.  People like to decide for themselves.  You attempt to take that away from that then you cause a backlash which is counterproductive to your objectives.  Reddit needs to worry about having the Section 230 protections of the 1996 Communications decency Act being revoked.  That would free them to censor who ever they pleased but it would open them up to massive lawsuits.  I guess we will have an answer to whether Reddit can say an election in November."

7397,"The vast majority of politics, and many other subs, would be banned based on these rules. This has never been about the incapacity of this place following rules, it‚Äôs been about suppressing votes through media conglomerates who work at the behest of political and global elite. They want you stupid, weak, timid, insecure, and brainwashed until the point of histrionic, brainless tantrums. 

This is not ‚Äúooh finally rulebreakers are being punished‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúpeople who didn‚Äôt break the rules but are politically inconvenient are being suffocated out of a site through loopholes because political dissent is a threat to establishment politicians who never thought Trump could win‚Äù.

Been here since early 2016, here‚Äôs my take...

This sub has never been about bigotry, and never about hatred of anything other than corruption. If you think otherwise, you‚Äôve been force-fed second hand information from the very people who profit from your ignorance.

Like when in a toxic relationship, Trump supporters are told that they‚Äôre the bigot and they‚Äôre the problem even though they are the one being silenced for having a fucking opinion that doesn‚Äôt align with the toxic person. Trump supporters are led to believe they are inconvenient, scum, deplorable. Not because they are, but because the toxic entity believes they are and spreads that information until people who don‚Äôt know any better make negative associations. When you speak out to explain the reality of the situation, you‚Äôre quarantined and told if you continue the same behavior of speaking up for yourself you‚Äôll be punished further. 

...Then you start to realize you‚Äôre in danger when you realize the situation you‚Äôre really in - you do what you‚Äôre told or you risk outlash/violence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a racist or a bigot, but if I wear this hat someone who has been lied to might knock me unconscious for thinking I‚Äôm something I‚Äôm not.‚Äù You make the conscious effort to conform publicly, so as to not get punished for playing in the stupid fantasy world that other people have been conditioned to think is reality.

That‚Äôs why memes are so prevalent here; they cope with the fact that you know the sad, maddening reality. Pepe the frog was literally mentioned as a ‚Äúhate‚Äù symbol on Hillary Clinton‚Äôs legitimate campaign website because the memes come from a place where people know the truth. And THAT is the only thing ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù about this place. No one here believes the bullshit about ‚Äúbreaking rules‚Äù. We know you‚Äôre only speaking to those who live in your web of lies, not to people here.

Imagine thinking you are in a free society, then because of one election you‚Äôre called racist for wearing a hat that supports the sitting President? You‚Äôre at risk for being physically harmed or being killed for your political opinion?
You always thought you had freedom until you realized what freedom you had was a dog and pony show put on by people who act like enemies in public and work together behind closed doors. Romney versus Obama, McCain versus Obama, Bush versus Kerry, Bush versus Gore. There was never really an option. You know where their loyalties lie. It‚Äôs not with freedom. They don‚Äôt care about you. It‚Äôs in creating that illusion and doing ANYTHING to get the power back to continue their work, together, as an entity that enriches themselves but blames free-market capitalism. Why? Because it allows for the chance of someone to compete in a world they have rigged for themselves to always win. 

Is California a socialist utopia? What about Chicago? Detroit? If we just elected more Democrats the country would be better, right? Look where they are elected and look at the poverty, the crime, the underfunded schools, decaying infrastructure, boarded up abandoned neighborhoods, health problems, unemployment, needle and shit-smeared sidewalks, etc. Look at reality. Stop pretending like loss of personal freedom benefits anyone other than people who make literal careers taking it away. 

**To anyone celebrating censorship:**

* If you are a person who disagrees with Trump‚Äôs actual policies and you‚Äôre celebrating censorship, you‚Äôre a coward. 
* If you are a person who thinks that Trump‚Äôs platform is based on racism, hatred, and bigotry you are a stupid coward. 
* If you are a person that thinks someone who has a different political opinion than you shouldn‚Äôt exist whether in virtual spaces or reality, you are a lost cause who is paving the way for mass oppression of all people. 

While you‚Äôre distracted thinking that your establishment politicians suddenly care about marginalized groups, they are using that emotionally charged sensationalism to get you to think you‚Äôll be punishing your contrived enemy with government intervention when in reality you are handing over ever-growing power for them to fuck over everyone equally. They do want ‚Äòequality‚Äô for all people, but not the kind you think. 

This nation is built on VALUES AND PERSONAL LIBERTY. America first is about restoring that FOR ALL CITIZENS. It doesn‚Äôt matter what race you are, religion you are, background you have, etc. everyone can be a freedom loving patriot who finds meaning in the fact that you have the power to become great if you choose to and WORK for it. Will there be lucky people who don‚Äôt have to? Sure. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you should stomp your feet and pretend like your life will amount to nothing. 

*Whatever government gives it can take away.* Don‚Äôt let propaganda convince you that your ability to think for yourself, defend yourself, or be yourself isn‚Äôt important.

So pick one. Choose to believe in yourself and work hard, understand failure and disappointment happens to every successful person who has ever lived. Or you can also choose to listen to people who profit off of telling you that failure is everyone else‚Äôs fault. People who make millions and billions from selling boogeymen who also say you‚Äôre a race/sex/class traitor if you question their narrative. People who censor you if you dissent. These are the people you trust more than yourself? You‚Äôve been brainwashed. 

To the real bigots, the ones too brainwashed to know they are and celebrate mindless censorship - WAKE UP."

7420,"Last time I checked, Wikipedia's article on ""Socialism"" was very long and detailed, discussing the fact that the term has been used by a variety of people. But nowhere in the multi-page article is any mention of a group called the ""National Socialist German Workers' Party"", even in the section about ""Socialism During WWII"". Not worth a single sentence that there might've been some tiny connection. I examined the Talk page for that piece and saw there'd been a debate, concluding with the idea, ""Well, socialism is about helping people and Nazis were bad, so clearly they weren't socialists and it's not worth mentioning them."""

Politics is just a play pen on this site. It's a curated space meant to give Bernie voters a place to feel good. No amount of ""red pilling"" there will make a difference in the slightest.

to support your question, his announcement from years ago of how he was taking away the ability for people to see upvote/downvote breakdowns on comments clearly would discourage reasonable people from using reddit. in fact, it is one of the most downvoted announcements of all times (and likely the only thread in the announcements sub with a score &lt; 0.)

by his own words, he has committed a bannable offense. (and as we saw with the upvote fiasco, when the admins institute new rules they do so retroactively)."

7625,Finally got my warning badge of honor lol imagine being reddit and thinking that any of us would remotely care if we got banned.
7626,Right. He specifically calls each one out by name and threatens them. There is no back pedaling from that.
7627,"This right here is what separates the pedes from the godless fucking liberals. You've got some strong moral fiber and I commend you for it. Most people on reddit would have just blocked me, it says a lot that, on an anonymous message board no less, you not only admit to being incorrect, but also insist your original statement stand for documentation purposes/the record. 

That's fucking awesome. Good on you. 

You are proof positive that T_D's followers are among the more civilized in regards to political debate on reddit. Thanks, fellow pede. KAG2020!!!"
7628,"I just dealt with one of those people. They are incredible losers. Honestly, it's crazy how they don't realize how much harm they are doing to their own beliefs/opinions and how many people are turning away from them."
7629,#FUCK Reddit and FUCK Steve Huffman!
7630,"If it's free speech you're after, go to the chankuns.

This is a battlefront. All pussies, deserters, and snowflakes should report to theDonald.win. You will not be missed."
7631,At least Tom Fitton can still post here. Thanks Tom!
7632,"You mean don't behave like everyone else does outside the_donald? Do as I say, not as I do? OK... HYPOCRITES"
7633,"This is crazy! I almost never comment, never made a post and just got the big warning.  Starting to think they flaggin us for upvotes on thedonald.win.  Like, stalking us.  üòØ"
7634,Use imgur for now and post the link with the jpg at the end. That's been working well for me. Unless that's what you're already trying and I'm confused.
7635,Fuck off cuck
7636,All it takes for them to ban all of us is to just mark the top upvoted in history.
7637,That‚Äôs a threat and sounds like something Antifa would say and has said numerous times about Justice Kavanaugh. Schumer should be investigated.
7638,Ok Zoomerü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
7639,Unfortunately their numbers were cut by over half and this Dom would probably be impossible to moderate.
7640,"YAWN.

Wake me up when something actually happens. Outrage-fatigue has set in, and there‚Äôs zero accountability, as usual.

Edit: oh, and this sub is basically unusable at the moment, being choked to death."
7641,"What's the case they are arguing about?

I'd imagine that if it made a difference their would be more of a stink about it right?"
7642,Lock that terrorist up!
7643,Oh bother
7644,And charged with terroristic threats. He is not above the law!
7645,Mods don't have to unlock anything- all they need to do is post shit on their own. There's no excuse unless they're not telling us some shit behind the scenes. They aren't posting Trump's tweets. They aren't posting developments about the election. There's nothing about Super Tuesday results and Pete and Amy and Mini Mike dropping out. Nothing about coronavirus task force. That would not take any effort in moderating the sub. Why have they resorted to posting literally fucking nothing except for Tom Fitton once a day?
7646,They took our bots! How dare they! This train has no brakes!
7647,"Not only subvert, try to replace you via demographics with those more sympathetic and willing to live under their boot."
7648,"This entire thread is a cluster fuck. I'm not even sure who's trolling, shilling, or trying to make America great."
7649,Looks like mods are manually approving every new post. Taking no chances.
7650,Barr is not doing shit
7651,Schumer's comments were outrageous.

7653,a downvote for a Pepe is an admission of faggotry
7654,"Nonsense. Just hold a majority.

We constantly see Red states not following the agenda (KY, AL). Thats the problem. No one fucking listens. We need the majority in 2020-2024 and a new Justice.

Force. Christ, at home you're pretty much regulated to taking the war to the wives. Get real."
7655,"First they had to dehumanize us as deplorables.

Then it was OK to throw milk shakes at us.

Then it was OK to fake hate crimes against us.

Then it was OK to drive trucks into our voter registration booths.

Then"
7656,"Free speech has nothing to do with what a private entity like Reddit chooses to remove from their platform

Learn what free speech is before you spout nonsense"
7657,Brownshirts were exactly this.
7658,"Good news is that the Supreme Court ruled that it's illegal for illegals to steal a citizen's S.S. number/identity.
Not that it wasn't already illegal, now states have the right to go after these criminal illegals.

It's beautiful if you think about it. We have how many millions of illegals? 10-20-30-40+ million and how many you wanna bet have stolen identities, from the living or the dead? I bet it's a number that would infuriate most Americans.

Now you can have a state that goes after the scum and the Fed can come from behind and give them a double dose of incarceration.
Also protecting those who live in CA. where they would be less inclined to prosecute."
7659,"Lol, the constitution guarantees freedom from prosecution by *the government* for your speech and expression. There are some limited protections from employers as well. That's basically it.

No ones constitutional rights are being violated by a company like Reddit choosing what they want on their platform. You really  need to know what you're talking about before you open your mouth and look dumb"
7660,Hand cuffs!!
7661,They want you over there. It‚Äôs a con.
7662,Schumer is a threat to the republic.
7663,playing bag pipes probably
7664,Think of what happened to Steve Scalise when a crazy man took politcs too far. Schumer should be FIRED! Tared and feathered!
7665,"I wonder if you post his words but said, ‚ÄúMr. Schumer, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price.‚Äù  How long the post would last here."
7666,God damn the subversive Dims.
7667,I will likely get banned for upvoting this.
7668,"&gt; What possible reason is there for not even doing that?

Drive traffic to .win"
7669,The mods closed it off and lock posts. Not admin. Think it through. Follow the money. A group created another site and want you there. We have hundreds of thousands of fighting winners here that don‚Äôt back down. This was a backstab. They waited for the right moment and pulled the plug on us. It was self serving.
7670,Anyone got a link?
7671,"It's not a mandate for war. Unless they want one.

It's called not affording them the ability to cause more harm. Stopping them from entering is not hard. Showing up in numbers tells them we are no longer confident in their ability to effectively govern. 

No need for violence. Unless they start it."
7672," 

**Invective**

Invective is abusive, reproachful, or venomous language used to express blame or censure; or, a form of rude expression or discourse intended to offend or hurt; vituperation, or deeply seated ill will, vitriol. The Latin adjective invectivus means 'scolding.' -Wikipedia

I bet if I went over to another part of Reddit and said I love Trump, I'd get a whole lot of this. And Crickets for defense. 

What a bunch of fucktards."
7673,"Free speech is not a formal noun, it is a concept - the concept that you are allowed to express your opinion freely without threat of censure or retaliation.  Reddit clearly is suppressing free speech even if it doesn‚Äôt reach the legal classification of denying a person‚Äôs first amendment rights."
7674,"If they cannot moderate then open it up to brigading, and let the admins ban us if that is their goal.  This current state of the Dom (not being able to post, comments being locked) is self-imposed by the mods in order to drive traffic to .win.  It is sad that not enough pedes are calling this behavior out as being wrong."
7675,"Entering? Entering what?  This is not an illegal immigrant discussion. 

If you want to stop libtards from attacking your elected officials then stop larping and just go vote."
7676,"Their job is to keep a conduit open for us to pass information to each other not to create content.

They are volunteers who are vetting candidates to be moderators as well as keeping and alternative conduit open for us to pass information.

The ones that usually end up causing the biggest problems in situations like this is those who complain and try to deviate from the plan that is in place.

Just chill."
7677,Reddit is Asshoe
7678,Because mods have chosen to lock down our Dom
7679,Reddit isn't suppressing anything except what they deem violates their TOS and they have every right to do so whether you like it or not. It's their right.
7680,There's no fucking way they're going to let us having this sub going into 2020 election. We have to be ready to move elsewhere.
7681,"The Terms of Service/Content Policy are considered a contract. Reddit's contracts are unconscinable. Contracts are to have parity with neither side getting a undue advantage which Reddit keeps changing to their favor.

Reddit's failure to equally enforce the rules/TOS are a breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the requirements of 47 U.S.C. ¬ß 230. This is also illegal and a violation under the Lanham Act- 15 U.S.C. ¬ß1125 et se.¬†

Reddit doesn't decide what a ""reasonable person"" is, the courts do. They need to be sued in federal court for their numerous violations of US Citizens rights. Let them see what a reasonable person thinks of their censorship and leftist ideology pushing when outside of the San Francisco bubble. I really wish Judicial Watch or some other conservative organizations would take this fight on our behalf. It's a shame what the ACLU has became as this would have been their cause 30 years ago. 

Here is my copy/pasta on the subject:

Reddit is a state actor of China. They accepted $300 Million to fund the site and regularly suppress content critical of the Chinese Government and actively allow pro-communist and socialist propoganda and posts to flourish. 


https://fortune.com/2019/02/08/reddit-is-blocked-in-china-but-may-land-a-massive-investment-from-tencent/


Their lack of action to outright calls to violence from the Socialists and Communists on reddit and failure to equally enforce the rules/TOS are a breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the requirements of 47 U.S.C. ¬ß 230. This is also illegal and a violation under the Lanham Act- 15 U.S.C. ¬ß1125 et se. 


Reddit is headquartered in San Francisco and thus must abide by US laws. It isn't in their Terms of Service or rules that they are acting as a Chinese State Actor, thus they are conducting fraud against US Citizens. 


This censorship of US citizens is a violation of their First Amendment rights and private company or not, they operate a social media company on US soil. In the 2017 US Supreme Court case, Packingham vs NC,  the Court stated that social media companies and cyberspace are the modern public square for discussing and disseminating ideas and this First Amendment protections apply.


Reddit acting as a state actor of China and censoring, banning, shadowbanning, or deleting US Citizens posts or quarantining communities is National Origin Discrimination pursuant to 42 USC ¬ß 2000a. US citizens and Patriot's have a right to free enterprise even on social media and it is a violation of US Federal Law to discriminate based on their National Origin, even Patriotic Americans whose pride and beliefs you may not share.


Please copy and share this everywhere. Feel free to improve upon it which better research as I am not a lawyer. Mods should really add it or a version of it to the bot post at the top of every thread. 


https://i.redd.it/x4qcco21oyi41.jpg"
7682,Fingers crossed they unlock it soon. I am not a fan of .win being a solution till the site is more fleshed out.
7683,"Everyday a fresh new outrage and nothing will happen. Just set fire to the constitution and get it over with. Till you frog march one of these treasonous f$cks to Gitmo I don't want to hear anything more from you,"
7684,"They say they can't moderate all the comments but what are we doing right now? Commenting in this thread. So okay, maybe they can't moderate effectively if they allow thousands of OTHER people to make submissions, but they obviously can moderate when they control what content is getting posted themselves. We should easily be getting 5-10 posts every hour for 12 hours a day if they bothered, regardless of reddit admins. Trump probably tweets 5 times a day himself right there that should be shared here, let alone some objective news. I understand how we got to this point by reddit admins fucking with the sub, but the mods are going out of their way not to keep the sub relevant at this point."
7685,"Is he? I'm not privy to the inner workings so I can't say for sure.

You don't have to hold out hope or keep the faith. I on the other hand tend to not jump ship at any whim. I'm choosing to take it as it comes.
If time passes and there is inaction than I'll more likely change my mind.  Until that day I choose to keep faith in Barr and the job he was hired to do."
7686,"&gt; If they cannot moderate then open it up to brigading, and let the admins ban us if that is their goal.

No."
7687,Ok it‚Äôs their right. So what? We can still criticize it as shitty.
7688,Pretty fun over there
7689,Is it just me or is this sub dead
7690,It **IS** a fucking outrage. Roger Stone was done for 'witness tampering' for less than this.
7691,Literal fascism.
7692,Yes.
7693,Sleepy creepy sniffy Joe..
7694,"Yeah, if it was Ted Cruz threatening RBG by name, the Dems would be coming unglued (and rightly so)."
7695,Yep. Tanked this to boost win
7696,"You are fine with the current state of the Dom it seems, but I am not.  I think this is unacceptable behavior by our mods."
7697,The same people who control a large portion of our government and almost all online platforms.

7702,"I‚Äôm still trying to figure out if your a shill or a corporate apologist.  I get that it‚Äôs their right to suppress free speech on their private platform, but what I am confused about is your passionate defense of them on this sub."
7703,"But Barr has not put one major offender in jail, he is doing nothing."
7704,"&gt; If time passes and there is inaction

Barr has had full declas authority, from Trump, since May 29, 2019.

What actions have you seen from this authority?

Every week, we see new evidence of blatant corruption .. shown to us by the work of private investigators like Tom Fitton, despite being thwarted by DoJ assholes trying to keep FOIA information from being released.

How much inaction and roadblocks are you willing to accept from the man in charge of bringing justice to the clearly, openly, visibly corrupt?"
7705,Reddit's defective is showing.
7706,"REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Ban me pls spaz"
7707,So they are picking and choosing what information they want on their site and what they don't including political opinions and ideologies that don't aline with their own. That doesn't make them a platform since they are curating and selecting preferred content to promote a political message. They have crossed from platform to publisher and no longer deserve Section 230 protection.
7708,"You seem angry. You should be using that anger and frustration for good.

Where have I said stop voting?
I said THEY, as in the Democrats, they steal elections. Padding votes, illegals, late ballots, etc.
Nowhere did I say don't vote.

I always vote. Do you? I voted yesterday. I always vote in my states primaries. 
You're barking up the wrong tree and no need for the hostility."
7709,"Hey Reddit!  Your president, Donald J. Trump, who **will** be your president for the next 5 years, received 400K more votes than Bernie Sanders---in California!

Choke on it!"
7710,Or reducing reddit's clicks. It's really the only thing the mods can due to hurt the admins. As far as I know there have been multiple times that the mods have tried to shut TD down and the admins bring it back. Websites survive on clicks.
7711,"Hey admins, go have a look at any thread in politics."
7712,"I would usually say this is stupid why do what they do us.

But since impeachment, I'd investigate them if they sharpened their pencil counter clockwise."
7713,"I've been defending them but I don't buy this reason at all. What conduit is there to speak of now? I'm talking bare minimum updates here. Just to be marginally relevant. Not original content. We get a Tom Fitton post about Schumer threatening Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, but not what Trump has to say about it? [https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1235359627082117120?s=21](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1235359627082117120?s=21)

They literally cannot be bothered to share POTUS' own words about this story? You're telling me mods are that busy, huh? lol okay."
7714,Look how smug that asshole is.
7715,I am angry about any suggestion that force is the right answer. Particularly at home.
7716,I'm only still here because they **want** us to leave.
7717,"I can't give you a definitive answer. I go with my gut. I can't say I've ever been let down by my instincts. I get the frustration. I do. I'm frustrated as well. I'm also a person that can look at a situation and see that even though it looks black and white, it may not be that simple. 
Tom Fitton would be able to answer or quell some fears, maybe he knows something we don't. I don't think he would blindly stand by Barr if he wasn't the guy for the job? Barr might not be. I'm not willing to give up. At least as of yet.

This is my opinion. I understand if you or others feel differently."
7718,"Well they‚Äôve officially won guys (on this website)

This placed is dead. No new posts, and half the existing ones are locked. What a bunch of fucking fascists. Unbelievable. Fuck this joke of a website."
7719,"Other subs: call for violence, harassment, death threats - especially along racist and sexist lines when their candidate loses a primary: absolutely no punishment.
The_Donald: *breathes* 
Reddit: ""23-19, we got a 23-19!!"""
7720,BUT THE Q SAID TRUST SESSIONS. AND Q SAID HILLARY WAS INDICTED IN 2017 BRO!!!
7721,"Yup. Subs all over reddit would be going batshit. 

The NY Times buried the story deep down on its front page.  If Trump had done this to RGB - the screaming headlines would have letters five inches high at the top.

All the cable networks would be calling for an immediate impeachment - and an impeachment vote would be taken immediately."
7722,It did..
7723,Not having T_D really takes the fun out of reddit but I still come here every day.
7724,Who really gives a fuck if reddit bans you? I couldn't give a flying fuck if reddit bans me.
7725,Of course it is.  It's basically Chinese agitprop.
7726,Based
7727,Ok so you admit they're a publisher and should be held liable for all the insane leftist rhetoric they allow to be published like constantly spewing misinformation like the wage gap or they're a platform and shouldn't be held liable for anything said on their platform but also cant restrict free speech...either way you just made yourself look retarded
7728,They only want cuckservatives.
7729,"What exactly do the Hindu Gods do to help mankind if anything? Do they sit back and  laugh at us? No compassion?

The One True God understands us and intercedes on our behalf.Hebrews 4:15 ""For we do not have a High Priest (Jesus)who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and  find grace to help in time of need""  Jesus is greater than Hindu Gods because He interacts in our lives. He died for each of our sins, He provides a way to salvation and off the reincarnation cycle (that does not exist) What proof have you that reincarnation even exists?"
7730,"So in other words.. Reddit Admins and Executives are in violation of their own content policy?

Communists oppressing people to silence truth... /shocking..."
7731,"What does Schemer think they did that ""released a whirlwind"" in the first damn place?  WTF?

They follow the Constitution."
7732,"Lol, you have zero understanding of the law. They don't post their own content ya dipshit. Content here is posted by users and when that content violates TOS they remove it. Simple as that.

Maybe you shitbirds shouldn't post racist, violent bullshit and you wouldn't get swatted like the cockroaches you are. Cry some more ya whiny little bitch, lol.

Keep crying...nothing will happen legally to Reddit, and there's nothing you can do about it"
7733,"Because at this point you‚Äôre literally addicted. I have felt it too, using this platform for 10 years.

But it‚Äôs not worth it anymore for me. I could be doing much more positive things with my life"
7734,It looks like over half your comments are in this sub.
7735,"Of course you are right, but, yall got any more of them spicy memes?"
7736,Username doesn't check out.  You're still retarded.
7737,"I agree. This sub deserves to die free rather than live on its knees. If .win was legit, why aren't the former mods also mods on .win?"
7738,thedonald.win That's all you need!!
7739,"They can't moderate all the submissions. If we're to be brigaded, we don't have the defenses. Moderating a lot of comments on very few submissions is a lot easier than moderating a ton of different spam submissions. Source: I mod a very large sports team sub on my non-political alt."
7740,Dead sub.
7741,Just report those comments.
7742,I'm not saying they should open the floodgates and unlock the sub for anyone to post. I'm saying what you're saying. They can moderate the posts that they make. No spam submissions involved. Just because they put the sub in restricted mode doesn't mean there should only be a couple posts a day and nothing else. I'm also saying they don't have to unlock comments either. Just post a submission and keep the comments locked. But a post with locked commenting is more than what we're getting now which is virtually nothing.
7743,So this is now the Fitton sub? Nothing against the man he‚Äôs a patriot but this is straight up election meddling.
7744,"He said free speech, not the first amendment to the Bill of Rights, moron."
7745,"when you have allegiance to your 2nd country you're a citizen of, over the country you're elected to work for, of course you're a terrorist."
7746,Fuck reddit
7747,It‚Äôs really not that easy to get these guys. Ya we can see the blatant problems but you need to legally catch them and put law to it. You need to cover every single step in the process and make 0 mistakes or they could slide free and you won‚Äôt get a second chance. There‚Äôs a lot of bad actors and plenty could be going on behind the scenes. They also don‚Äôt want to freak out half America and perp walk some big figure head that the crazy libs love and start riots. We don‚Äôt need the day to day function of he country to come to a halt.
7748,Don't we all just love this type of free and open democracy!!!
7749,I assign Tom Fitton to oversee the 50  state prosecutors and call them out by name for not doing their job- prosecuting the well-connected!!
7750,But talk show hosts are crying on TV! Let's destroy the constitution!

I just think you are clowns. I've been happy for 4 years straight because of trump whereas you've been crying like a little, pathetic, cunt.
But carry on üòÇ"
7753,"Last time I checked they had 32 mods at the .win site and 10 of them are also mods here at T_D. The question I have is why does it take 32 mods to moderate a private site that claims no censorship?

Spez: I‚Äôm not suggesting they should reopen the site to posts but I agree with the original commenter in this thread that the mods should be posting Trump tweets and live feeds of Trump rallies at T_D while they vet new mods."
7754,"I understand perfectly ""dipshit"". Are you really so far up your own ass that you're that blind or is it just an act. If your precious TOS prevents speech that you disagree with but promote speech you agree with you are not a platform. You are curating and selecting content. Its the difference between a magazine publishing stories and a community bulletin board. No matter if its by staff writers or op eds the magazine is legally responsible for what's on their pages. That is the point Reddit is getting to right now. They are twisting a legal standard designed to facilitate free speech while protecting the businesses hosting it. If you're gonna suck reddit's dick do it somewhere else."
7755,"Since I already knew we lived in a banana republic, sigh."
7756,"Barr has publicly refused to do his job on a number of occasions now, all the while insisting that the prosecution and conviction of Roger Stone was righteous. Unfortunately, Trump isn't going to fire him until after the election."
7757,"No, there are no new posts unless you're already a verified or approved user.  Which is exactly none of us."
7758,They've crossed the line into publishing as far as I'm concerned.  How that status gets changed is way beyond my pay grade.
7759,Make an Autobot that posts Trumps tweets.
7760,Maybe the Bongino Report will open up a large multi-interest forum.  Sure sounds like a place where I could call home.
7761,Meh. Investigate my balls.
7762,Brit is right and yet he won last night..tells you the power behind the Democrat Party..they unite even if it isn't right..Bernie getting screwed again.. I starting to think Bernie is a plant.

7766,You're describing a loophole- the government can just ask a corporation to censor people. In order to preserve the purpose of the 1st Amendment loopholes must be removed.
7767,"Yeah, just wait till Chairman Xi's Politburo orders his own personal *baizuo* toerag, spezziedick, to begin introducing social credit scores that are are tied to your reddit karma points.

They'll call it something groaner and dorky, like 'Creddit', and try to convince us that it's the latest 'trend' in achieving 'free benefits' like a 'luxury' apartment upgrade[!!] (with running water...cold, of course...in the communal shower...down the hall).

7768,"&gt;Maybe you shitbirds shouldn't post racist, violent bullshit and you wouldn't get swatted like the cockroaches you are.

When content is removed it becomes impossible to verify what the content actually held. We don't post racist/violent stuff; we're just censored when we tell the truth. You can't prove otherwise- the evidence is gone.

Obviously, if you're adamant that we're in the wrong this would be irrelevant. Evidence beyond your preview would necessarily be incapable of affecting your opinion. Attempting to remove it rather than looking at it simply means that mathematically the limit approaches infinity in likelihood that you will remove the truth. Far more likely that you're removing quite a bit of truth.

Hypothesis is not theory. Everyone lacks understandings; by keeping information from yourself and others there's only one result that happens: the same that has always happened.

7888,"I'd like to know what reddit considers a reasonable person.

In the UK sub it's virtually impossible to find reason on the topic of immigration. The entire sub is not representative of the citizens of the UK either.

Most people do not want immigration to increase and have not for decades. Only a tiny fraction want it to increase. Many of those themselves immigrants.

The sub is dominated by a tiny minority that believes:

* That nation including its people have no right at all to control immigration.
* All migration and migrants are unconditionally and universally positive.


Those are not reasonable positions and that discourages over 80% of the citizens of my country to not participate on reddit.

The enormous disproportionate representation was obvious during the EU referendum.

Virtually everyone supported remain. Anyone else was shut out. You would also think remain would have won overwhelmingly sampling the activity in the sub.

Instead of discussing it on reddit I went to other forums without huge userbase bias and it was clear leave was likely to win sampling those and discussing it."

* We're seeing this with Obamacare, how the problems it's caused are being blamed on Republicans (who largely haven't touched Healthcare) to move on to Medicare for all...
* We're seeing this with Border Control, now we have all of these ""undocumented americans"", that they let in. Now we need policies to make it easier for them... wtf.
* We're seeing this with the homeless crisis... Conservative places aren't struggling with this...
* Racism, they insight the racism and bring in radical minorities (Ilhan Omar) who has done absolutely nothing in her life but promote the destruction of Western Values.

Perhaps DJT/Campaign or RNC will allocate some of the $10 million in funds they set aside the other week for legal stuff in the election to fight fraud to deal with it; or someone with a equally funded pocket, like *Hulk vs Gawker.*

Redpill: The problems are because of the judiciary not enforcing the basic laws of the land (and no I'm not talking about Bill of Rights).

Fixing the 3rd branch of gov takes time."
7932,They are.
7933,Turddit.
7934,Probably more fuckery.
7935,"I agree with them if they‚Äôre purposely trying to limit clicks, fuck Reddit with a sick dick. Twice."
7936,"&gt; Well if the mods would open it up

Sure feels like there's more going on than what we know about, and the real TD mods are taking extreme measures to slow down the hijacking and death of this sub.  The mod team was infiltrated by Reddit ""official mods"" and perhaps the old mod team decided to lock down the sub instead of wait for some fake ""Trump voter"" to post fake shit that violates the rules here and gets the rest of the mod team wiped out, or the sub banned.

As long as this sub is alive and the massive amount of visitors can still come here then people can find the alternative site, and people can at least see stuff here posted by Fitton, etc.  The alternative may be losing the sub completely, and the massive amount of traffic."
7937,Yup üëç

7939,When was voter turnout ‚Äúin excess of 100%‚Äù? Do you have a source for that?
7940,"I do not agree with the logic behind your argument.  If ‚ÄúTrump supporters are in control‚Äù, and have chosen to restrict our ability to post, and have locked existing posts from comments, then it may as well be non-Trump supporters in control.  The Dom is effectively dead if we can not communicate with each other.  However, if what you predict occurs, and the Dom remains open and gets ‚Äúnew commie mods‚Äù, we can still post and comment what we think.  They will have to ban us to stop us from doing so.  That would be the wiser course of action IMO."
7941,"^Listen to this guy^

I've ridden so many dying Internet fadsites into the bitbucket that my fingers are permanently qwerty-bowed.

You also need to get over to the regular politics subreddit and not miss the opportunity to show that the paid media is truly the enemy of the people.  Bernie is about to be skewered again (yeah, maybe he kinda enjoys this or maybe his payoff is ridiculous fat stax but that's another topic)

We have a chance to lead at least a few of them into the reality.

Of course we won't convince everybody.  That's what the best quote in ""Cool Hand Luke"" is all about.  ""Some people, you just can't reach."""
7942,"So basically this should get the politics sub banned. Go there, or virtually anywhere on reddit, as a trump supporter and see how ‚Äúencouraged‚Äù you‚Äôll feel to participate."
7943,Does this mean Reddit bans itself for breaking its own rules against The Donald patrons?

7952,Bingo!
7953,Unbelievable. Anyone with a sense of humor would find that funny. Lol. Really??  That's what took down the Donald??  I cannot wait until November. Joe Biden is not going to beat the best president in the history of the last 30 years I've been alive.

So you are arguing for an Admin takeover? You would rather the admins take over the T_D and desecrate the corpse than have the people who have been running T_D since OhSnapYouGotServed herself attempted to shut down the Dom in protest of reddit and got banned for it. I don't follow your logic.

&gt;The Dom is effectively dead if we can not communicate with each other.

Side note: still waiting for sources and corroborated facts to this claim.

7983,"I need to find out what has happened to this sub. Let me get this straight....

As far as I know they just want all of us banned &amp; are manipulating their rules &amp; targeting us so now the leftist cucks at Reddit removed half the awesome mod team on here &amp; are replacing them with ‚ÄúReddit approved‚Äù soyboy beta liberal freaks which basically ruins this sub.

Is that right?"
7984,They need  to censure Schmuck for this. It's the Senate so they legitimately should be able to easily due to having the majority.
7985,"Exactly. This used to be my go-to default, whenever I had some time to catch up on the news.  Now it's just a shadow of its former glory. The win sub seems better than this, but it doesn't have the same level of posting and comments."
7986,To keep the sub from being compromised with dis/misinformation under the guise of The Donald.
7987,"Sounds like cuck talk. We always win no matter what cheap bullshit they pull or how much crying takes place, and Trump is winning 2020. Existing in their leftist shit hole and always winning is the best part but we can't do that when we're locked out of posting in an effort to move us to another site (and for whose benefit?)"
7988,Then they probably need to see a proctologist.
7989,Yes but it's the mods that are preventing us from posting now. They say it's because they can't keep up after the admins removed a bunch of mods but it seems like it's more an effort to push people to the .win site. Seems like defeatism whereas they should let the sub fight until it is removed.
7990,"It is disgusting what is happening here.

Reddit is horrible. Simply a brainwashing mind control outlet for MSM and government shills."
7991,"Legally speaking, the quote is completely protected speech. For speech to fall outside of 1A protections, it must be both intended to and likely to result in specific, imminent lawless action, according to *Brandenburg v. Ohio*."
7992,"As I do not have any authority here, I am not particularly worried about what may happen outside of my control in the future, but I am concerned with what is actually happening now.  I am certainly not ‚Äúarguing for an Admin takeover‚Äù, but am arguing that when given the choice between the current Dom situation (posting restricted/comments locked), and facing the threat of a potential admin takeover, the latter seems to me a less intrusive, wiser decision.  My reasons for this argument are more thoroughly stated in my comments over the last few days of this restriction if you care to know more.  

Try not to place your assumptions into my arguments.  I have no personal feelings to the current group of mods.  I have been shitposting on this Dom before this batch of mods came to be, and will hopefully be doing so after they have moved on.  My loyalty in this situation is not to either these mods or the admins, but to the Dom.  These mods certainly did not ask for my input as to what they chose to do.  

If the admins decide to adopt more stupid policies like having mods reporting people for psychological evaluation (whatever that entails), then they will be continuing to destroy their own product.  Stupid them."
7993,When we strap up and remind the government why they should be afraid of us and not the other way around. That‚Äôs been lost in this country. Politicians act with impunity and suffer no consequences for the horrible shit they do. DC is by far the richest area in America and they produce literally nothing but shit.

8014,"&gt;[North Carolina voters approved a voter ID constitutional amendment in 2018, and ID rules were supposed to start during the 2020 elections. But a federal judge has blocked it ‚Äî in a ruling that said the law was motivated at least partly by racial discrimination.](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article238913033.html)  
  
&gt;*North Carolina is the only state in the Southeast without some form of voter ID in place.* That was supposed to change this year, with new voter ID requirements set to start in the 2020 elections. But on Dec. 31, 2019, a federal judge blocked the voter ID law from taking effect, at least temporarily.

&gt;U.S. District Court Judge Loretta Biggs ruled that while a trial can still sort out the issues, it appears that parts of the law ‚Äúwere impermissibly motivated, at least in part, by discriminatory intent.‚Äù

&gt;North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat who is representing the state officials including Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper who were sued over the law, has said he will appeal that ruling. But since the 2020 primaries are so close ‚Äî absentee voting for the March primary starts Jan. 13 ‚Äî Stein said he won‚Äôt fight to retain voter ID in the primary election. So only the general election in November is still in question.

&gt;*People in North Carolina support voter ID by a double-digit margin.* So as these legal developments unfold, many are likely wondering what the controversy is all about.  
  
Another Obama-appointed judge stomping on what the citizens of a state lawfully voted for with zero proof of ""discrimination"" and completely supported by Democrats at the state level."

I checked the post history of the only two T_D mods that are not moderating the new .win site and noted that they were both actively promoting it. My guess is that the remaining T_D mods will take their time to turn over T_D to any of the new mods provided by Reddit so they can drive more users to the .win site. I think if they can reach a pinch point - when the traffic at T_D slows to a trickle - they will just shut T_D down. I don't agree with the strategy but I wish them well.

Projection at its finest. These people are straight from some npc horror film. fucking mentally ill clowns.
8109,Snowflakes are some of the most unreasonable persons ironically
8110,The final solution to The Donald question
8111,can you post it?  I'm fairly out of the loop and would like to see what the central mods are doing
8112,"Let me tell *you* something, pendejo. You pull any of your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away from you, and stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger 'til it goes ""click."""
8113,"Apparently some people have tools installed that check your post history, so they can always point it out as if that makes your opinions less relevant, but since they have nothing good to say, they just invite everyone to downvote you just because they don't like you."
8114,"I'm only here to say T_D is dead, Trump is gonna win and Reddit is cancer."
8115,Admins are faggots
8116,"I just want to know exactly what I can say to get fully banned from this shithole?  The Democrats are a bunch of faggots?  Reddit Admins fuck goats and like it?  Trying to figure out what will just tip their scales.  I've gotten a warning, no clue why, they didn't even say which post I upvoted that wasn't supposed to be upvoted.  These people are absolute scum.  Disgusting.  Would love to meet some of them face to face.  I mean, I'm sure their mothers hate them, and because of that  they came out evil."
8117,Could be people who were banned and created new accounts.
8118,Yep. Rest in peace Aaron.
8119,I think you need to read it again my dude. You said Reddit is biased towards the right
8120,The_Donald did not kill itself. Reddit and its soy admins did. Fuck you Spez!
8121,"WOW! From 65 to 42 to now 2!!!!!!

It is F'n scary to see what they sicko's are doing to our world. Did 65 people suddenly come on and didn't agree? 

Reddit, burn in Hell."
8122,I know right? Just down votes. I only asked a simple question out of genuine curiosity and no body had the ability to answer it.
8123,"Ever since this bullshit, with submissions restricted, there's WAY less content. Reddit admin fags have essentially achieved their mission of killing the sub. They're going to be super pissed though when their plan to ""sway the election"" doesn't work and Trump gets re-elected:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident that Reddit could sway elections. We wouldn‚Äôt do it, of course. And I don‚Äôt know how many times we could get away with it. But, if we really wanted to, I‚Äôm sure Reddit could have swayed at least this election, this once.‚Äù

8124,Yet it really isnt
8125,"&gt; Even Rush Limbaugh believes Barr will get it done.

He totally blew the call on Biden. I knew for the longest time Biden was the inside pick and the machine would push him over the finish line."
8126,I feel like most Trump supporters know nothing about him and only vote him because of his campaign.
8127,thedonald.win is getting ddossed. often times it wont connect
8128,Why are all the posts getting locked? üîí
8129,"This fucking pussy ass Club Penguin bullshit. I've been on Reddit for quite a long time and honestly, I'm just about done. I have *thousands* of filters on the front page (thank you RedditIsFun) and it's still unbearable. I even leave some things I don't agree with or engage with on there to challenge my worldview, but it's always the same pussy ass spoon-fed echo chamber bullshit. I feel like Dunkey quitting League... what's the point of putting up with this insanity if you can't call someone a stupid buttmunching faggot **just because**. There is none. Don't wrestle with queers - you get cum all over you and the queers like it. I'm being a little hyperbolic getting this frustration off my chest but not very. I guess Reddit can just be the braindead liberal hangout site, like every fucking where else. It's just barely worth the energy to engage with rabid anti-intellectuals (by which I mean people who don't think for themselves). God bless Trump for injecting some sanity into American politics. Shame no one will ever thank him."
8130,"I'm sorry, your argument about win not being legit is what?"
8131,CF makes a site almost impossible to DDOS unless someone knows the actual site address.
8132,Pretty much. This sub really is just a constant stream of crap about 'owning them dems' and crap like that
8133,Cause they mods dont feel like moderating them
8134,You waste all this time and Trumps still going to win thr election. Lol
8135,This right here
8136,Its okay Sanders lost the primary anyway :)
8137,Oh idk probably that they were dissenting.
8138,Test.
8139,"&gt;You waste all this time

Uh yeah, Reddit is a time-waster for me, dummy.  Seems like you take it very, very seriously though, which is pretty sad and pathetic.

I suggest you try holding your breath until that happens.  Good luck!"

And, tbh, I am just tired of winning. I also have lots of stuff I want to do with my life. So with the sun setting on the sub, I just want to wish all you markass marks, trickass marks, punk bitches, and skip skap skallywags a happy and prosperous FOUR MORE YEARS.

8150,"They don't understand that it's things like this, on a micro-scale, that are driving people away from the Left. 

Peter Thiel nailed this decades ago--people have an issue with political correctness and Progressives because they experience their censorious nature on a personal level. 

It's in sports, videogames, comic books, tv and film. 

And now they even want to BAN you simply for UPVOTING content that The Clergy deem inappropriate. 

People have come to deeply resent this intrusion into their personal choices. 

But it's all good. I walked away from the (racist, sexist, and fascist) Left a few years ago, and I will be voting for Trump in November partly as a big fuck you to all of these people."

Mods, gtfo with your long ass process and just pick some fucking mods and let's get on with this. If they fuck up boot them, this is our subreddit not yours. You're literally letting Reddit win.

8204,Yes! He was definitely mad. My job here is complete.

8215,Came here to say this. Lol it's such a pain in the ass trying to find the most recent post that we can actually post a comment in. Then switch to new.

So then why not allow members to freely post again daily, but only allow comments on say 1/3 of the posts (for 24 hrs each post unless topic seriously warranted longer lifespan) - the 1/3 they deem most interesting or meaningful? 

Or to be on the super safe side of thorough moderation, allow comments on just 1/5 or 1/10 of posts?

Even 1/10 (the most interesting posts)  would be a vast improvement over the 1 or 2 per day we're getting."
8223,"Yep, and that is the biggest drawback to .win. it is easier to knock offline or take down in general."
8224,"First mistake was probably having it hosted by cloudflare. Fking internet, god i hate that we cant have what we want smh."

8230,Thanks .What other places can we pedsters go? I was on a four day vacation and came.gome to this mess.....any suggestions were I can go or do I just have to wait it out?
8231,It appears the mods that used to run this show has taken all their marbles over to [TheDonald.win](https://TheDonald.win) and then shut off commenting on this sub for the rest of us in a attempt to bribe us all to move to .win. Now they can't even seem to keep their .win house up and running. There are plenty of other places to go to keep informed. Don't blame the reddit admins for shutting down comments here!
8232,We will return
8233,Damn that tweet had to hurt! Not physically but I‚Äôm sure it hurt his feelings real bad! Fuck Biden!
8234,All every other sub does is bully and shit out trump supporters from conversation thru invective. Isn't that breaking 3 rules already? u/spez is tranny fluid and wont do anything

8236,"Honestly, im not sure, doesnt seem like there is many outlets that are active left for us, t_d done, now .win, hell am i suppose to go check out 4chan rofl, im not sure brother, wish i knew, id be there whereever that is now."

8253,No idea
8254,What Schumer said was despicable. Full stop. To threaten Supreme Court justices threatens our entire Democratic Republic and he should both apologize and be censured for his violence-baiting comment. He made a direct threat towards two justices by name!
8255,Shit and feces covered cocks
8256,Lol .lose is down
8257,get fucked
8258,There are the 2 discords for big news. Neither has an update on .win right now though.
8259,"Stop shilling that isolated echo changer. Of course this sub will be dead if everyone just accepts defeat and shills the fuck out of something we have no idea of the intention.

8261,"Redpill: You've missed the point and didn't read the bills or the CDA. These bills aren't additional legislation, these bills are definitions. Your 'my Constitution' claims are invalid since there is supporting legislation that enables Reddit to act like it does. You can't yell about anything being unconstitutional when there are laws that make it acceptable.

The CDA is a law that exists to protect ISP (Internet Service Providers) from the actions of its users. Companies like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit are hiding behind these laws and are claiming to be ISPs. 

Here's a little snippet of the law.  -&gt; [Law Reference](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230)
&gt; **47 US Code 230 **
&gt;
&gt; (1) *Treatment of publisher or speaker*
&gt;
&gt; No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.
&gt; 
&gt; (2)Civil liability
&gt;
&gt;No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of‚Äî
&gt; 
&gt;(A)any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; 

Since there are multiple court cases that have affirmed the law and effectively spread the protection of the law out, you can no longer use other tort since there is plenty of precedent to support the expansion of the law to these companies.

You can't just wish this to go away.. You have to define Reddit/Twitter/Facebook as publishers so they can be held accountable for their actions.

I didn't include the text from the HR 492 and I probably should have.. here it is.

&gt; This bill provides that an owner or operator of a social media service shall be **treated as a publisher or speaker of user-generated content (and, therefore, may potentially be held liable with respect to such content)** if  the service or its algorithm does any of the following:
&gt; 
*  displays user-generated content in an order that is not chronological;
*  delays the display of such content relative to other content; or
*  hinders the display of such content for reasons other than to carry out the user's direction or to restrict material that the provider or user considers obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.

Ya see? Laws exist that protect... they have to be more precisely defined."
8262,You're obviously mentally challenged. So sorry for getting you all worked up. Maybe ask your caretaker to put some cartoons on for you can calm down and make sure to keep your helmet on. Wouldn't want you getting hurt while you throw your tantrum.
8263,"Admins ban half of mod team after a constant threat of shutting down the sub and active steps to silence us. Then admins say ""use *our* pre-approved mods or close the sub because you can't handle the traffic with a small team"".

The mods made the right choice; not negotiating with the clowns. So, we have .win where we can actually be ourselves, and TD is restricted because, with such a small mod team, they can't handle all the traffic.

And y'all are salty about the mods making a space for us to be ourselves.

Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face."
8264,Why does the canary link still work?

.win is awesome. Easy to get to, i can easily jump from reddit to there just like switching subs. And it feels so free over there with that energy. 

Reddit wants to cripple this sub but not take the heat for an outright ban going into the election. 

The mods started .win when the admins quarantined this sub. I can't stand the hate and allegations that they are operating for selfish reasons. They came through like champs and pushed back on Reddit. 

Reddit is the bad guy here. Original mods are heroes. 

Get your love on .win and then spread it onto other subs. This sub should just have a few big stories and mostly just link to .win. Fuck reddit, take their traffic and give back redpills."

8309,Then you can drink the cum
8310,TheDonald.win is down :(
8311,We are quarintened here so what the fuck do you think this is?
8312,"In addition to being unfairly quarantined for the better part of a year now, the admins came out and said we can't even upvote content they don't agree with anymore and threatened to ban everyone that did, then removed nearly every single active moderator from this subreddit, virtually guaranteeing that it would be overrun with rulebreaking content. They then said that we can only have new moderators that they have handpicked and prescreened. The moderators that are urging people to move to thedonald.win are trying to save the community. Opening up comments and letting the admins take over the subreddit like you so badly want them to do will destroy it permanently.

8316,"The point of cloudflare is to obfuscate the IP. If the IP is known that's a fail.

Second, what you are pointing out doesn't have much meaning. If the server is saturated, no response. If pings are disabled, no response. For all we know, they set up a caching solution incorrectly and there is no disk space resulting in a failure to create sessions and serve pages.

On and on as to what could be wrong, none of which have to to with any malicious actor.s"
8317,Okay so when I say anything random in people go o u r on the Donald that should be considered harassment nice one way street continuing from these people.

8329,Me too

8332,"Ah, the *double down*. You're not very good at this, are you?

&gt; seriously how do people get this retarded

It's probably from you drinking your own piss."
8333,Win is also down for me. Is everything alright?
8334,Rantingly.com
8335,On twitter they posted they are working on .win
8336,"The use of the world ""whirlwind""  is a message to the bad actors.  He is calling for action.  Must keep sacrificing babies at all costs."
8337,So the link to the canary exists but it no longer says the _Donald is not compromised which is concerning.
8338,"Not trying to be alarmist but the last time cloudflare ‚Äúdropped‚Äù a client for wrong think, they made it look like this. (Basically blocked the origin server on their end and turned off caches)"

8342,lol. You are baby. Stay here then. .win is growing by the day
8343,Can't reach Donald.Win... DDOS?
8344,Cloudflare likes to block the origin on their end and disable caches to make it look like this when they drop a customer for wrongthink.
8345,Same

8347,"If they go the average ""reasonable love trumps hate"" Redditor... Lmao"
8348,"TheDonald.Win is under DDOS attack. Even when we leave reddit, the lunatic leftist follow us. Hating Trump is their binding ritual. That's why they follow us and harass us like crazy ex-girlfriends."
8349,TheDonald.win is down. Not working for me.
8350,Awesome! thanks for the update!
8351,What is link to the discord?
8352,Still says that for me.
8353,I always try to be polite and not upvote anything questionable and I get targeted in other subs at times. In politics I can only post every 9 minutes. I did nothing wrong over there.
8354,"This is exactly correct.  Admins have put us in the ghetto by the quarantine, and now they want to ban us for simply upvoting.  Completely unacceptable."
8355,"Yep, reduced to name calling, just like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sander supporters. No difference"
8356,It's down.
8357,"You think because of the quarantine people still don't come here? Subs continued to grow and there were even more posts from people being red pilled.

  


Open your eyes."
8358,Nice underbite...
8359,"Probably.

All roads lead to the same conclusion. I have known it for years.

Damn why could I not live in a quiet time in history?!

*Sips on Rye*"
8360,Can we're either open The Donald back up or can we fix .win? This is complete bullshit...
8361,https://twitter.com/thedonaldreddit/status/1235559054925234176
8362,I think it was called ‚Äúthis video will get Donald trump elected ‚Äú
8363,Lazy? He's deep state. He's running out the clock.
8364,"How could that possibly happen in a supposedly ""blue"" state?  The dims are asking themselves that question but are afraid of the answer."
8365,Can any mods provide an update on TheDonald.win ? Would like to have some first-hand evidence of the truth rather than rumors/speculation.
8366,"Please re-open. Win barely works, at least here they can ddos us without shooting themselves too."
8367,Yeah I was thinking the same thing and was wondering if it would happen. No matter where we go we should self monitor ourselves. Behaving nasty does not draw voters into Trump. When I came onto this sub 4 years ago after having been a Bernie bro I observed for awhile and when I started posting I was welcomed and encouraged. Yesterday there  where many posts on the Donald Win just taunting and making fun of them. That‚Äôs the mistake Hillary made. Not a smart or compassionate move imo.
8368,Hmmm that's weird. Did you clear the cache?
8369,Probably Chicoms at work while we slept.  They do not want pro-Trump info available anywhere on the internet.  Censorship is their speciality.
8370,"To each their own... Just out of curiosity, why is this an issue?"
8371,[yet it really is](https://www.americanthinker.com)
8372,It was similar to that. It had a Latinos for trump scene and was similar to one of those motivational videos with inspirational background music
8373,"I just gave you a clear explanation for why the comments are turned off, and the only thing you got out of that was I called you a pathetic cuck?"
8374,"So its just like a gulag where we are the political prisoners doing forced labor in inhumane conditions and the people working at reddit are the communist tyrant camp guards that belong to the ""right"" party?"
8375,So like a nazi?
8376,congrats on the brain tumor.
8377,they'll just do the same thing and how do we remod the mods removed for wrongthink
8378,Ok to shoot senators on a baseball field?
8379,"I wouldn't be here if thedonald.win wasn't down.

Any update with that?"
8380,"Its okay. Super Thursday is upon us, so we'll see how well he does."
8381,"Social media has changed a lot in 20 years.  There was a certain obscurity, so you had to know the other people and work to connect.  The lefties were (and still are) a small fringe group who didn't know how to manipulate discussions.  Most people on the Internet were IT and computer engineers who tended to be conservative, intelligent, and driven by practical results.  I miss Tom."
8382,The fuck is going on with .win?
8383,Can someone explain to me why there aren't any new posts?
8384,"Since Hillary will delete you for saying anything that might get in the way of her getting more power, and you can't use reddit if you're dead, you basically aren't allowed to post anything that isn't pro far left radical nonsense."
8385,"Satisfying to me ... that in the sidebar ... T_D‚Äôs Numbers have gone Up in the last few days from 793.1 to 793.4!!

8392,Cloudflare fuckery in progress.
8393,"For sure it's deeply immoral. 

I don't know what you mean by use intent. I used ""intended"" because I was copying the language of SCOTUS in their decision."
8394,The sub is in restricted mode because there aren't enough mods. Reddit admins removed over half the mods and sent an approved list of who can replace them..
8395,"https://i.imgur.com/QJRVvks.jpg

Another reason to keep the sub open."
8396,"Schumer *defintely* resign in disgrace, but as he doesn't **feel** any disgrace I'm guessing he won't...."
8397,"For fuck sake's guys just take us off restricted and let us go out the right way.

This is so gay"
8398,Hi I'm Joe Biden and i cant remember this message.........
8399,"What's with this fitton guy ? They like 10 thumbnails of this guy wearing shirts from the children's section of Target and his flexing on every single photo . When did this sub become the_fitton ? I must have missed something . Someone should Photoshop a cock into his hand on this thumbnail because it looks like he is stroking one , I should know"
8400,"I attribute such posts to those who are more interested in being energetic, over the top and ""at war"" with the opposition than those of us who desire a more curated, moderated ""source"" of news. 

I love free speech, believe me I do, but I also love ""constructive"" speech. It would be divine to have a ""shitpost and meme"" sub forum for people who enjoy doing such, and a more curated ""this is real news you need to be aware of"" type main place. 

Just my opinion."
8401,"&gt;  The moderators that are urging people to move to thedonald.win are trying to save the community.

Give me a break."
8402,"These folks downvoting you don't look or sound like pedes, do they?"
8403,"Also, let‚Äôs landslide these motherfuckers"
8404,Came here to check too since we‚Äôve been limited from making posts. this is some bullshit
8405,Jesus I hate reddit so fucking much. Im guessing the removed mods were wrong thinkers. I'm sure the new ones are TOTALLY on the up and up and not shills at all.
8406,Fuck off shill. Play dumb elsewhere.
8407,I got attacked all the time for posting here too.
8408,Ding ding ding!
8409,"How exactly do you see things playing out here on this platform long term? Honestly, do you think the admins are suddenly going to change their minds and let this place exist as it was? They are literally telling you that unless you change what you post and what you upvote, then you can't exist here.

I would honestly like to hear what people think is going to happen here long term."
8410,It's killing my upvote finger!
8411,"Same reason I don't want reddit to have my phone number or email address.

It's private information that can be used against me by bad actors if they decide that they don't like my opinions."
8412,Take your morning Lexapro and come back when you are feeling better.
8413,Stay in your lane Cuck Schumer. Why do Dems feel the need to kill babies so badly?
8414,"Now all we have to do is come up with a universally agreed definition of a ""reasonable person"""
8415,Is this subreddit growing?  The number of readers seems to be increasing little by little..
8416,"That's a good reason, but we need to remember that true privacy is already dead and our information is already available online, if you know where to look."
8417,"&gt;At least here they can't ddos us while we're punished for ""wrongthink""

I love this sub as much as the next Trump supporter. But what's the point if we aren't ""allowed"" our right to free speech?"
8418,I joined TheDonald.win right away when it was announced.  I think you're missing the point and doing what Republicans were always doing before Trump showed them how to stand up and fight against liberal hypocrisy and bullying.
8419,I was just on Twitter. The admins are aware about the new website issue and are working on it.
8420,Reddit is Chinese communist asshole Pete buttieg butt fucker homo lgbtq cum drinking faggot people of color
8421,"Also true.

Seeing a ""give us your phone number or you can't join"" prompt just irks me, though."
8422,So what decision is the Supreme court deciding that has everyone riled up?
8423,Comments aren't the problem. The community is pretty good about deporting shills.
8424,Came here to see if I could find out why it isn‚Äôt online
8425,"Yeah, Dot Win is down. Maybe unrestrict this sub if the other one can't stay up."
8426,Posting in this thread because we can't create threads. What has happened to thedonald.win? It's down with server error
8427,If they wanted to waste their money they should just send it to Bernie.
8428,I pray to Kek every day.
8429,"My guess, it points to a static page on a different Vhost, so whatever is broken on the main site doesn't affect it."
8430,Doesn't hurt to ask him/her.  I am trying to research the legal aspect a little too.
8431,"WtF with .win ???

Open this sub back up!!!"
8432,They also need to create an app for mobile users. Something like Reddit is fun or bacon reader.
8433,"Nobody knows what's going to happen, including you.  We can speculate all we want, it makes no difference. We get two different understandings from what we read, apparently.  I'm not taking the word of any mod here or their site as being completely factual, unbiased or not self-serving.  They did this to us purposely in conjunction with the admins to get us to leave here, it's all the same people.  

I think that's a betrayal of everyone who's ever subbed here, and I think it's despicable.

If I can't post in TD, then I'll post elsewhere.  If the sub completely dies, it was fun while it lasted and I enjoyed my time here.  But I won't contribute to their sneaky, underhanded behaviour.  I can get Trump info in other places."

In this article:

""CloudFlare joined the growing list of companies refusing to do business with sites which do not support their leftist, globalist agenda. One called the Daily Stormer was taken down, after founder and CEO Matthew Prince wrote in an internal email in which he reversed the company‚Äôs previous stance on not censoring content, adding that it was an ‚Äúarbitrary decision‚Äù."
8435,"Not for certain but it seems like the algorithm governing the weight of upvotes has shifted. I wouldn't be surprised if subscriber count algorithm has been modified too. 

I wouldn't put it beyond admins to make these changes while they attempt the coup here."
8436,"Admins said on Reddit that they're working on it. I know zero about tech, so I'm sure it's, you know, complicated business."
8437,"It's ridiculous that virtually every other country in the world, but so many US states do not. The argument that it's ""too hard for minorities to get ID"" is also ridiculous, when you need an ID for so many other things. It's also racist on its face, implying that minorities are too helpless to get an ID.

It's such a transparent cover for allowing non-citizens to vote, making it easier for people to cast multiple votes, and other voting fraud.

If there were real justice in this country, all of these lawsuits challenging states' voter ID laws would be dismissed with prejudice."
8438,"soooo you are going to stay here and hope it opens back up? Trust me, We all want this open Again. Reddit has made it known that they do not want us here. They think they can change the election. They cant. Reddit did this. the writing was on the wall along time ago. We knew it was coming. I must have said it hundreds of times since 2016. But to only hang out here and hope something changes. Not going to happen. I wish it would, but its not"

Only one of us is rejecting observable and testable evidence. I'll slow walk you there if I have to.

I will. Keep rejecting reality around you. Keep doubling down. Keep demonstrating your illusory superiority. It's a good look.

8506,"Its an extreme form of censorship.  Even on facebook you get fairer treatment than reddit.  And reddit depends on your political views.  As long as your on the left you can spoit all the violent rhetoric you want.  I've been encouraging people to migrate to mewe, where I've never experienced censorship."

8516,Look how well the free speech on .win is working right now.
8517,WHAT HAPPENED TO THEDONALD.WIN???
8518,Solo cups and chain link bridges. Reach more real voters anyway. As they just saw on super Tuesday these reddit retards aren't even going to go vote.  Go to the rest of reddit and be pro Biden watch em tear their selves apart even more.
8519,But Cloudflare can still decide to stop providing its service to any client it doesn't like.
8520,"Still not banned :( 

And I am trying really hard, mind you."
8521,Is thedonald.win down for anyone else?
8522,While I don't disagree this could happen. The Twitter for .win claims they are working on the issue and it was an 'admin error'
8523,and what do these fucks call us every chance they get?
8524,Nice.  Thank you

Just let this sub open and if it gets banned so be it, at least there will be some impact and even maybe governemental assistance, since DJT made an AMA here.

8588,"The fact that it is possible means they shouldn't use cloudflare. It isn't difficult, it's just time consuming, to create a distributed nameserver network and a distributed hosting network across various services globally. At that point, the left would have to get every hosting company to shut it down. And load balancing would mean the cost of hosting would be similar to whatever they're paying now, except it would mitigate the single point of failure they're clearly exposing."
8589,"Agree, counter attack these cuck mods. Even if we have to use tom fitton posts for our only means of comms. If you're going to make a back-up site it needs to fucking work and be user friendly."

8593,"I said this just a minute ago.

I have the skills to build a distributed network of nameservers, load balancing and distributed servers across many hosting providers. It's not really a special skill, I'm sure there are many others here, my point is they need to build it this way instead of relying on $20/month cloudflare."

8601,I blame lazy developers. Used to be everybody ran their own servers and had the knowledge to do so. Now we have a generation that knows the AWS JSON formats for every service from memory but couldn't set up a deploy on bare hardware if their life depended on it.

You double down in the face of all odds and take the bull by the horns and show it what's what!

8696,"It's utter bullshit. No sane person would interpret what he said in the way that Shumer is trying to spin it. 

Supreme Court justices can't be voted out.  They can't be impeached just because you don't like their decisions. (At least not yet! Give the Democrats time and they will try it, though.) Their jobs are secure until they die or choose to retire. So what ""price"" could they reasonably be expected to ""pay"" for their rulings? 

And the sentence ""You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions,"" is a clear-cut threat and incitement to violence, literally made on the steps of the Supreme Court. No spin can change that. 

I am not holding my breath that anything will happen to him, not even censure. But he should be criminally investigated for this."

Update from the wireshark traces:

The TCP handshake with the SYN/ACK from sever and client side was good.

8821,"**I didn't miss the point at all, in fact you detailed my point exactly.** The ""laws"" which I was referring to which are unconstitutional, are the existing industry co-written laws; and its case law which I was referring to which also needs to be stricken down to be anti-cannon as it too is unconstitutional. Badly written laws and badly argued cases, does not make precident; and in particular case law cannot trump the Constitution.

The whole concept of which the existing laws or these bills above, are trying to ""deal with the situation"" are intentionally barking up the wrong trees (ie lobbyiest money in DC). These laws don't exist to ""protect""; they don't need to be more precisely defined; they are unconstitutional and need to be removed.

In America, we have one set of laws which apply to everyone (&amp; everycompany); we don't have two sets of laws (ie one for nobility and one for everyone else). These protections and carve-outs of the framework of ""publishers vs platforms"" can legally exist in most other countries where they have ""nobility"" sets of laws, but this cannot legally exist in the USA.

No new law is required, it requires a case based on old school, US Constitutional, legal framework. This will result in the striking down of many unconstitutional statutes and case law, and solve the problems desired in dealing with Big Tech and other industries as well.

In the USA, property owners have rights and also have responsibilities. It's not the governments job to police private property, but the property owners job. It's also the property owners liabilities for some of the things which take place upon their property, and also can make the property owner a party to a matter between others upon the property.

In respect to corporations, they also have a duty and obligation to be lawful and do not get a free pass to do as they please; corporations only exist by permission, it's not a God Given Right for a corporation to exist. Corporations across State Lines, or across Federal Borders, do not get free passes, nor can laws or treaties override the Constitution. Corporations which have foreign nationals as workers, contractors, investors, owners, or other involvements come under even more Constitutional **limitations** (not Constitutional *exceptions*).

One of the most basic (and flawed original) arguments/reasons for the ""publisher/ISP"" immunity, was because of the technological seemingly impossibility of a property owner self-policing their property. These arguments and logic do not hold, particularly where communities can self-report, where the owners can &amp; do intervene (of course all owners can intervene from the beginning of time), and of course technology has advanced so it's not the Wild West on the net anymore in specific regards to this at hand (and even being the Wild West wasn't a justification for lawlessness and fueling criminal activity on the net, like drugs, human trafficking, fraud, etc.)

For major bonus points, can ask the Court to strike down it's own unconstitutional  [Ashwander Guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashwander_rules), written by (IMO) the worst Justice in American history; which tell the Court(s) to violate the Constitution in many ways, including telling the Court to not do their highest job of enforcing the Constitution, and be lazy and allowing the crud to pile up.

*""We must reject the idea that every time a law's broken, society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker. It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions.""* **‚Äî Ronald Reagan**

# To End Big Tech Censorship, Simultaneously Ending Foreign Election Interference, &amp; Most Corporate involvement in American politics:

1. These corporations are engaging in interference with US Citizens and the electoral, election, and political process.
2. These corporations hire foreign nationals, and receive foreign moneys.
3. **Nowhere in the US Constitution** did We The People give any branch of the FEDERAL GOV the power to allow foreign nationals to interfere with US Citizens and the American election (political) processes.
4. These Companies shall either: ***Option A.)*** Cease their activities of censorship on US Citizens (and company involvement in politics); OR ***Option B.)*** Be required to divest all their foreign nationals from employment &amp; contract, and third party contracts &amp; agreements for the same (Founders included), and divest foreign investors &amp; moneys. From a practical and legal reality; all companies will have to chose Option A.

**VERY LEGAL AND VERY COOL. STRICTLY CONSTITUTIONAL! (and cost to implement it, perhaps as cheap as 4 tweets or less; okay also a 1 page E.O.)**

MAGA On!

PS Redpills: In America, this issue is not defined as the globalists (imo globalist is a marriage in ideologies of elitist/nobility and Marxism) want of ""*publisher vs platform*"" with the kings/nobilities immunities from law/consequences; and immunities by destructions of legal borders.

In America, the issue is defined a ""*private property vs public property*"".

* Public property is property owned by the government (public park, town square, city hall, highway, national park).
* Private property is property owned by private individuals and entities/groups (aka not the government).

Don't let any bluepilled case law, legal code, tell you otherwise. Be weary of anyone who carries the water of trying to frame private property as public property. Just because people congregate in a place, doesn't make it public property. Taking private property for the government/crown is one of the key abuses/powers which was severely limited upon our Founding, to prevent these very problems from existing in the first place."

8843,We can be on the same team and disagree with how things are handled.
8844,.win is down?
8845,"I can confirm, down since *at least*, 0700 Central, it now being 1200 Central."
8846,When Mr_Trump reopened it got banned almost immediately.
8847,"Dont take it personally, they have had a lot of negativity over there lately and many users have been getting fed up with it and reporting those people. Sounds like you just got caught up in the fray."
8848,"&gt;The first problem you come across is that r/The_Donald is a community of people who, almost to the individual, feel full-on stifled. Most feel as though they‚Äôre flat out censored.

L-O-Fucking-L"
8849,Stop it that is not what was going on at all.
8850,"Wow, Tulsi is still in?  Why??  Lol"
8851,"we still lurk though. 

today i found myself missing the gif of hillary getting thrown into the van like beef"
8852,"Just white, she would never do anything patriotic."
8853,"I'm freaking out, man."
8854,Mods open the dom (or have you made it a sub now?) back up and stop trying to force us to go on your personal website instead.
8855,"The twitter said ""update shortly"" whatever that means? That makes it sound like it might be down for a while to me...wtf"
8856,"Did you perhaps miss that ""I joined TheDonald.win right away?""  Doesn't mean that I want to roll over and give up on Reddit.  Anyway, why are you still here?"
8857,TIL things.
8858,"Violation of the first amendment. This is a joke. Reddit is a joke. Blame T_D for their awful Democrat candidates that no one who has any intelligence will ever vote for. So scared of people seeing through the bullshit. I'll never forget this and my future kids will know what the ""left"" is all about."
8859,Twitter say update shortly. From about 25 minutes ago.
8860,Oh. A Hillary mistake. I gotcha.
8861,same
8862,"Dear Reddit Censorship Nazi‚Äôs
#TRUMP IS STILL YOUR PRESIDENT"
8863,"Hey lazy ass mods, why don't you sticky a post about .WIN. Lord knows you're not doing anything else."
8864,It‚Äôll be back. Mods tweeted about it. Nothing sinister
8865,"Jesus fucking Christ. Next it will be ‚Äúyou have violated our guidelines by not using gender neutral pronouns which goes against our policy‚Äù 

This is unbelievable"
8866,"# BIG ARMS, BIG CALL OUT!"
8867,"They were testing direct image uploads the other night, so they‚Äôre still doing production work on the site. Chances are something went wrong during a code push."
8868,seems so
8869,Twitter says update shortly. From about 25 minutes ago.
8870,Been so for several hours for me?
8871,hmmm 6 hours to recover from an admin error.... Must be very complicated.
8872,"Yeah, they‚Äôre still adding features to the site, so a bug may have crept into the code when they updated it."
8873,i saw a Texan in here saying it had been down since 5am.
8874,"It's all so pointless guy, just give up and retreat to your designated .win ghetto (if it's even up)

Edit: downvoted in the dom by a bunch of retreating defeatist .win cucks. I'd be fine with the site if this place wasn't shut down to drive us there"
8875,"No, no, no. That's a wipe. This is more like Clintoncide."
8876,Oml. I forgot about that homes. Guess we need to  appoint more Trump judges tho üëå:)
8877,I'm sure they did but you can't just become a mid again. The vetting process is apparently extremely rigid.
8878,Holy shit. That's scary. We really are F'd. I guess we have to rely on the honor of the pilots. The hour is very late.
8879,Hopefully not for too long though.
8880,"Wow, thread not locked yet"
8881,"Sometimes it‚Äôs hard when a new failure pattern emerges. I‚Äôm the founder of an SF company you‚Äôve heard of and just yesterday a new data pattern caused our global data replication to take a shit like mini mikes campaign. Took an hour to find the root cause and fix it, meanwhile the east coast was chewing us out on blue-checkmark-cuck-land."
8882,Yes. A million times yes.
8883,Either DDoS or cloudfare got emails from sjws being angry at hosting us
8884,"Could be an issue with Apache or Nginx?  I've seen updates come through that wipe the config file, and then your site is hosed temporarily until you get the config file right.  Btdt."
8885,Screenshot it. You‚Äôre gonna need it for the impending lawsuit.
8886,The problem is they can't keep .win up.
8887,"I just got a perma ban from /offmychest for posting my first comment here.

Are you joking."
8888,Welcome.  Here's your üåü
8889,Tick tock... lol
8890,Please take screenshots.
8891,Not to mention that all the hosting providers just shut you down when you get all the kinks worked out so you have to do it all over again with another hosting provider.
8892,"They won‚Äôt dampen enthusiasm, but they will slow down the flow of information.  Information and news and arguments that are helpful to Trump flow through the Donald and then out to our normie acquaintances.

If they can slow the flow, we will be less informed and less effective and they can keep bad stuff about Biden from circulating"
8893,going back and fourth. Plus the win has been down all day. I am starting to Rethink the shut down of the_donald.
8894,"If the Republicans are the party of the rich and Dems are for the working man, why does every tech multi- millionaire support Dems. They will even support Socialism and communism before supporting conservatism."
8895,Damn straight! If anything it just gets me more fired up to red pill my friends and family and vote out the dems! I'm hoping for a Republican governor in Montana this year ü§ûüòÅ
8896,Agree. It‚Äôs been at least six hours now.
8897,And they're not telling us anything either. Does anybody know what the hell is going on?
8898,"Or make a sticky about it, at least."
8899,This is all I want.
8900,Seth Rich?
8901,Here here!

8906,why? they are currently working. the person who owns the server is having the issues
8907,I‚Äôve been waiting for someone to bring this up lol
8908,"This sub is now The_Fitton.

No offense, but... pathetic.  Bring this sub back, please.  Allow the community to self-moderate."
8909,Went down around 5:45am CST. I was online trying to post the spice
8910,Amen. The mods got cucked by spez. Closing the sub is a real beta bitch move.
8911,"After super t, no.  Looks like most of his trade support left for trump.

Get my coat ready.   Holding out for michigan."
8912,"Every day for 4 fucking years I've been coming to T_D to upvote and read the latest and greatest from you glorious bastards. This fucking sucks, I'm going through withdrawals. And now TDW is down! Dammit!"

8915,That's a big ol chicken dinner right there.
8916,Yes
8917,Btw thedonald.win is down......
8918,Goddamn right!
8919,I say that only because you never know what they'll do to conservative websites.
8920,"Well, for starters, *he ain't doing anything.*"
8921,They suppress this sub but if you go to the politics sub they're threatening violence on Trump supporters. Reddit is the most hypocritical bullshit to ever exist.
8922,"We get it Tom, you work out. No need to perpetually flex the biceps"
8923,Interesting...

8925,"I love Tom's self-awareness with the ""BIG"" and ""HUGE"" tags in all his headlines lol."
8926,Is anybody having trouble getting on [thedonald.win](https://thedonald.win)? Every time I try and open the link it says that the server is down. Would like to remain in the loop! Thanks in advance!
8927,The mods here want to push all t\_d traffic to the .win site. I have my thoughts as to why.
8928,TheDonald.win is down. Anyone know what‚Äôs going on? Are they being ddos attacked?
8929,"A few basic American legal framework issues with CDA and editting it:

1. The federal gov (any branch) doesn't have the power to give liability release to non-Federal crimes.
2. The original case law(s) and other federal laws which set the basis of things like telephones across state lines, or corporations across state lines are flawed in themselves. The premise of the CDA doubles down on these flaws.
3. Granting immunity to some class or group, is exactly the two tiered nobility vs non-nobility system which doesn't lawfully exist in the US. The size of the nobility doesn't matter, be it Kings and Dukes only or also lesser nobility.
4. The legal challenges to the CDA were not all inclusive, as with any Case Law, it requires having similar merits, facts, and legal arguments to be relevant. Case Law (contrary to what is usually taught, practiced, and repeated) does NOT settle or decide the issue. Case Law is only relevant if the other issues also line up. Most Goalpost moving laws and Goalpost moving Case Law, are built upon previous flawed cases. Case Law is far more applicable in civil cases, or criminal cases; but not in cases of Constitutionality.
5. In particular the Constitution cannot be changed by Case Law, just as the Constitution cannot be changed by legislation.

Yes, we see things from different angles, and things need to change, but I have a feeling and all indications, GEOTUS is doing his 45D chess and playing the long game here. At the moment, T\_D feels like it's that point in *The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly* and the 3 way standoff... but we know who wins in the end :)"

8939,Anyone else having a blast with all the infighting going on between Bernie supporters and Democrat supporters? They're tearing each other apart and I couldn't be more entertained. I'm just realizing that maybe 90% of the assholes from the politics sub were Bernie Bros all along.

Ah, yes, the privately-held communist Reddit. 

We've been talking about the power of corporations and tech for years. You just only like unregulated markets when it does what you want. 

It's pretty hilarious though to watch people act like Reddit exercising its free speech rights over its private platform is somehow a first amendment violation. Or that private companies being free from regulation for the public good, what your party has been pushing for since forever and still, is  somehow ""communist."""

Right before that reddit decided to start warning people, up to and including banning their accounts, for upvoting the wrong things WITHOUT saying what those wrong things are.

This is in addition to years of ridiculous censorship and arbitrary rule enforcement, quarantining, etc.

At some point it is just too much.  

The t_d mods created a backup site with their own money because of the ever increasing bullshit the administration was pulling against us and it was obvious to all of us that it was just a matter of time before things got so bad that we would be effectively hamstrung.

It‚Äôs actually a psychological need that they have. When faced with an opposing opinion, they NEED to believe that the other person is a subhuman piece of garbage.

9247,"Why be an asshole? I've posted there more than 99% of people, including yourself and continue to do so. 

I'm not doing anything other than asking people not to perpetuate blatant lies. I want win to succeed which is why I post there frequently, but it is a lie to say it is as active, something you seem to clearly agree with me on. 

Do you understand this concept? I am simply asking for people not to be dishonest, and yet your response to to call me a cuck. 

This is the sort of toxic nonsense that is electoral cancer to moderates and independents, people like you are why the GOP lost and lost and lost until Trump came along and showed that there was another way, and still, people like you continue to perpetuate retardation in pursuit of some grand purity test as though anyone gives a single flying fuck about how dedicated you think you are. 

All this because I asked someone not to lie. Take a page out of Trump's book and pick your battles better, trying to ruin someone elses day over a non-issue because you made the decision to have some dumb hot take is just loser behavior. What's worse is that people like me spend their days trying to bring people over to this side and work tirelessly to do so and instead of picking a fight with the other side, you have decided to pick one with me as though I've done something wrong."

Part of why I think you aren't very intelligent is because you keep conflating my request for people not to lie with 'trashing TD'.

I must ask, are you so profoundly unintelligent that you can't discern the difference or are you a butthurt incel looking to pick a fight with someone? 

Remind me why I should take this seriously? For all I know you're just a concern troll trying to make TD posters feel demoralized and stop posting. I don't go around calling fellow TD users cucks in a totally unsolicited manner.

&gt; start building something better for everyone side by side with all of us, your brothers in arms. 

My 'brother in arms' is shaming me and insulting me when I never even addressed him, and for a reason I still am unable to discern. This reminds me alot of last decade when I was a leftist and I would say something like ""obama didn't actually do this thing"" and leftists would downvote me and call me a racist and tell me to stop trashing on Obama when I was simply pointing out an untruth.

I still think you're probably a troll or an idiot and you haven't given me a single reason to believe otherwise, you have no self awareness of how retarded you sound citing the phrase 'brothers in arms' when you treated me this way despite the fact that I did not message you first. You shame me, insult me, then call yourself my brother in arms. No thanks. There are lots of good and reasonable people on the right side of the aisle, you aren't one of them."

Long read, but basically mods saw an opportunity for a fear-mongering cash grab and instead of tightening up they poked more holes in the ship so it would sink faster. They wanted traffic on the 'other' site so that they can eventually monetize it once the election hits in full swing.

You don't find it bizarre the site pops up out of nowhere and the mods start herding us like literal sheep into a pen where no one else on the internet is going to pay attention to us?

If you provide a place to have conversations, then allow people to have conversations and don't silence them because you don't want to hear it. However, you should be able to redirect these conversations to appropriate areas. As a very low-level example, someone posting recipes in an auto-repair forum can easily be moved to the recipe forum.

9604,"We are at the precipice of a deeply disturbing paradigm shift.  


According to Reddit and its admins, WE, being Trump supporters and members of The_Donald, aren't able to ***behave in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit***.  But THEY, being people that don't support Trump, are exempt from this rule.  The way someone who mentions anything pro Trump is treated ANYWHERE on Reddit, outside of a The_Donald and a very few subs, is disgustingly appalling and is THE very definition of the behavior Reddit and its admins claimed they locked down The_Donald.  


Reddit's convenient interpretation of this extremely nebulous and vague rule is a ridiculously one sided abuse power and the First Amendment.  All political views aside, the actions of Reddit and its admins is abhorrent and immoral on many levels.  Reddit and its admins have enacted a blatantly obvious tactic to silence any and all dissenting political views.  Regardless of Reddit being a ""private business"" this is a violation of our First Amendment rights.  Reddit and its admins have a moral obligation to stop this systematic extermination of free speech.  


It is 100% fine to disagree with someone and their political view.  That is what makes this country great.  But, once it becomes illegal to disagree, we have reached the beginning of the end.  If anyone on the left thinks that it's ok to suppress, censor or remove someone because they are just stupid Trump supporters and they deserve it, keep in mind, that it is only a matter of time before the needle of disfavor points to you.  Sanders supports have already witnessed this.    


To think that the behavior of Reddit and its admins is any different than the behavior of the National Socialist German Worker's Party of the late 1930's is simply denial or delusion.  This is simply the first stage of their Final Solution.  Without a significant alteration of course, the way this ends has already been played out.  History will repeat itself.

9612,"There's a huge political upside to us being labelled as iredeemable deplorables

That's it, the weekend is *almost* here! Just a few scant hours stand between you and the glorious stretch of R&amp;R so earnestly well deserved. 

Don't abandon TD! Stand your ground, practice what many preach - never give up, never surrender!

Love to you all, have a most wonderful Friday, Patriots! God bless us and God bless the United States of America."

9617,"Welp... I stayed away from the tranny fluid, but apparently that wasn't enough.  I got my hand slapped by the thought police today for upvoting comments in conspiracy last night.  Some T\_D people were getting brigaded by idiots, and I was showing my support with upvotes."
9618,"No election tampering here by Reddit. Look away. Reddit wouldn't do that, would they? LOL. 

I kid of course. They absolutely  would, do and are!"
9619,We don't save it everytime we see it because we aren't power tripping marxist weirdos that want to shut them down. We know that people will be assholes on the internet and it doesn't bother us so we read it and move on. What bothers us the hypocrisy behind when they accuse us of doing the thing that they do shamelessly.
9620,Who else can beat down the foggot libs like I can?
9621,"Never Give Up.

Never Surrender.

We must fight these un-American, non-Western forces that seek to destroy us.

And make no mistake: They aren't American, or Western. They do not value the individual over the group. they have never experienced The Renaissance or the Enlightenment. They have no experience with the Western philosophy of human rights.

They would grind us and our families under the treads of their tanks if they could get away with it."
9622,"Any average person who threatened two Supreme Court Justices by name right in front of the building would get arrested.

Why can the Federal police not arrest Chuck Schumer ?  Is he above the law ?"

9624,"Man... that‚Äôs nuts. What a funny coincidence this happens right before the elections.

Thank you for the breakdown."
9625,Being an asshole and threatening violence are 2 very different things. The left constantly try to conflate the 2 and use it against us. I'm all for being an asshole I will not tolerate threats against us because time and time again the violent left follow up on these threats
9626,"The shitty site that doesn't load half the time? No, most of us are not going to bother with that."
9627,"Liberals talk about civil discourse.. but it all flies out the window when someone who espouses ideals they hate starts being heard, they only tolerate it when the speech is unheard."

Im trying.... but one can only get permabanned so many times...."
9630,The morons on reddit acting tough probably aren't the ones following up with their threats. They're faceless people threatening other faceless people. I can assure you I'm not scared of threats over the internet and the moment we react to it we become as weak as them. The real problem is the admins acting like wrong think is dangerous and that its responsible for people getting hurt. Not the random faceless people making threats anonymously to other anonymous people.
9631,I cant see any the donald posts on main... I  have to go directly to the sub.
9632,"Just like when a cop uses a blown license plate light as pretext to pull you over and look for other shit, Reddit will just use those posts as pretext to ban this sub.  Their liberal motives are totally transparent."
9633,TO GULAG!
9634,"Sadly, no one in the real world cares. The media either won't report it, or will celebrate it as ""an attack on racism"".

9638,"also, i think his handlers have blackmail or position over his arrest &amp; scrutiny."
9639,This dudes right but why is every pic showing him flexing his arm?
9640,Reddit is completely unaware that they are effectively and openly positioning themselves as a **PUBLISHER**.
9641,I don‚Äôt even know what upvote triggered my warning.
9642,"There are no TD posts. This one is the latest. The sub has been shutdown by the Swamp/China.

Sorry, my dude, but you live in Orwell's *1984*."
9643,I still have this one and my non- political one (because I mod a few subs on that one and don't want to deal with the headache)
9644,"He's not flexing, he's just sitting.  His arms are just that big because he works out.  It's hard to find shirts with oversized arm widths, so there's nothing he can do about that."
9645,"The sub has been effectively shut by the mods, not the admins.  They prefer their own site now, not this one."
9646,"He intended to say the words he said, obviously, but Schumer did not advocate specific lawless action.

""You've unleashed a whirlwind, you're going to pay"" is not advocating a specific criminal act. I'm certain that the very SCOTUS Schumer threatened would not find Schumer's words to be outside of legal political speech."
9647,Yes it does. Its also new and will get better over time. Join or don't. I don't care lol
9648,"&gt;Unfortunately, candidates need to go through our regular vetting process in which we learn their age, location, experience, reason for wanting to moderate, as well as putting them through a voice interview, which is then followed by extensive training. We cannot hand anyone the keys to The Donald without taking these important steps.

Why isn't this true of any other sub on this entire site? Including ones where people regularly threaten violence."
9649,Yeah I agree 100% but corporations do not equate to the government. Thus why its a legal issue and not a civil rights one.
9650,[I gots me my gold star finally!!](https://i.maga.host/PSvSpdn.png)

9652,I thought pinko meant like kinda commie? Reddit is as red as a baboons ass commie
9653,Idk lol like the way it sounds.
9654,Do we got an alternative here? I'm really not a fan of .win. Feels like a lame attempt to get more clicks when it isn't needed. This from someone whose been here since 2016.
9655,Schumer stepped waaaaayyyyyyyyy over the line. He needs to be charged.
9656,Only if those crossing the borders vote democrat. If a poll proved that most of them voted Republican they'd not only fully fund the wall but personally help build it too.
9657,"&gt;The sub has been effectively shut by the mods, not the admins.  They prefer their own site now, not this one.

 No one can be red pilled at ""their own site"" because no one goes there! It is not open to the masses. It is a circlejerk devoid of other input. 

 Reddit shut us down so that we can not red pill the rest of this website! Otherwise this hoax of a Corona virus spreading to  wipe out the human race would be blown wide open by the research that WE do and it would counter the MSM fake news mass hysteria!"
9658,"Yes.  This is T_D mods doing this, not Reddit.

9685,Nah they are mostly alright people.
9686,They‚Äôre hoping you self police and not participate at all.
9687,"They are well aware, and believe these actions do not make them a publisher.  And that is not necessarily wrong.  

I mean, fuck them for doing this, but consider that .win can and will delete cucks and leftists - and that is just fine.

An argument can possibly be made that reddit/facebook/twitter et. al. are so big that they are effectively the ""town square"" perhaps, but it's clear that Reddit believes they can censor us legally."

Also, none of the rest of us can post here anymore which gives you an even more powerful voice as people drop in to check on The_Donald. It's kind of a *Speaker for the Dead* moment in time, you know?"

I really feel like the mods are trying to force us to go to .win don't get me wrong I love the site, but I would much rather this whole sub be gone than reddit admins take it over and get the advertisement claim rights and money and completely trash it. That is what they will do. I'm going to be honest I feel like our own mods have let us down here. Just let us post. Let the cards fall. Stop being cowards. This isn't MAGA.

9828,What if one were to accuse u/spez of being a cock sucking little bitch boy. While simultaneously making accusations about his mother being a fool for not swallowing when she had the chance? Is that bullying?
9829,I‚Äôd only support that because he can afford the security. But we need a depo with a civil trial lawyer who can trap the best of liars. Lit it on video since it will be evidence to any potential jury.

9862,"I know you may not see this because your inbox gets inundated with notifications, but if *I* were to threaten Supreme Court justices, I would guaranteed get prosecuted. 

Why is it even a question with Schumer? Because he‚Äôs in Congress? I‚Äôm sick and fucking tired of politicians getting immunity in every crime they commit. It‚Äôs despicable."

9957,"I think the Bernie bros and the left in general got a taste of reality when it comes to censoring everyone but your side. They think because Twitter and Reddit is all about Bernie that it would translate into votes. That's why they think Super Tuesday was rigged, because they barely see opposing support so they get deluded into thinking they're winning.

They have zero idea that the Bernie vote is doing worse than it did against Hillary, and yet she was actually a better candidate than Biden. Bernie has already succeeded in being a better candidate than Biden (minus the heart attack) so the only thing left is the fact that America as a majority does not like or trust communism or socialism. We fought against it and always will.

They can censor our internet posts and points, but not our vote on NOVEMBER 3!"

9999,"[Might want to double check that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965)

&gt; From 1888 to 1908, Southern states legalized disenfranchisement by enacting Jim Crow laws; they amended their constitutions and passed legislation to impose various voting restrictions, including literacy tests, poll taxes, property-ownership requirements, moral character tests, requirements that voter registration applicants interpret particular documents, and grandfather clauses that allowed otherwise-ineligible persons to vote if their grandfathers voted (which excluded many African Americans whose grandfathers had been slaves or otherwise ineligible).[16][18] During this period, the Supreme Court generally upheld efforts to discriminate against racial minorities. In Giles v. Harris (1903), the Court held that irrespective of the Fifteenth Amendment, the judiciary did not have the remedial power to force states to register racial minorities to vote.

So yes, at the federal level what you said is true, but it wasn‚Äôt until 1965 that states were prohibited from passing their own restrictions that functionally prevented many minorities from voting."

10015,I received one of these even though I hadn‚Äôt been on reddit for over a week prior to the day I received it. I think they‚Äôre just going down the line sending them to anyone that‚Äôs posted on T_D. Probably a precursor to banning conservatives and/or shutting down T_D.

10161,"Honestly for months now I have been thinking that Fitton might be controlled opposition. He apparently gets access to all these ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù, and yet I cannot think of anything he has actually exposed. Has anything Fitton has released actually changed the situation politically? Compare this to O‚ÄôKeefe and Project Veritas, where they have exposed many things and helped create a shift in the public consciousness. Just that ABC News hot mic video about Epstein alone did more to wake people up than anything I have seen from Judicial Watch. 

Also, there is just no way a human being could be photographed with this many dumb expressions on his face this consistently unless it was intentional.

10162,"Its a business... and the people they want to advertise to are big companies like Proctor &amp; Gamble, etc. Those companies are cowards. They're terrified of losing even a single $3.48 sale of Bounce dryer sheets because some SJW on Reddit saw a post from a T_D user about how they love Bounce dryer sheets.

Now the SJW complains to Proctor &amp; Gamble that white supremacists use Bounce, and that's why Bounce dryer sheets are colored white, and that Proctor &amp; Gamble is racist.  The executives, instead of actually having a spine and calling this person on the phone and laughing at them, and then laughing at the cockroach reporter who picks up the story because she wants to make a name for herself, they instead apologize profusely, add purple dye to the Bounce dryer sheet line of products, increase the cost by $0.50 to offset the dye cost and production headache this causes, and they threaten to pull their advertising from Reddit, because Cond√© Nast is also staffed with these shitbird cowardly corporate types.

Its a fucking huge circlejerk of cowardice, and it won't end until someone has the balls to stand up to these whiners and tell them to fuck off... and they absolutely **need** to be told to fuck off, because *they're not buying the goddamn products anyway!*

A masterclass on how to handle these worthless shitbirds is to look at what Daniel V√°vra did.  He didn't cave when people cried about the lack of Black and Brown people in Kingdom Come: Deliverance. He didn't cave because the game is historically accurate and there *were no black and brown people in 13th century Bohemia*, and the people whining aren't going to buy the game anyway.

As far as Chinese interference with Reddit due to investment, there's not much to do to combat that now... the only way to really have open platforms is to pay for them. If Reddit and Reddit-like alternatives really mean as much to us as we claim they do, then we have to start paying... even if its just $1 a month or $12 a year. Reddit has tens of millions of users, and even with a site this size, it wouldn't be difficult to keep it afloat with $1.2 billion a year.

People ought to have realized by now, either through seeing advertisements that are targeted to them, or from listening to Edward Snowden's interviews - if you can't figure out what a website is selling within 5 minutes of browsing it, then **you** are what they're selling. If we want to really take back the Internet for ourselves, we're going to have to pay for it."

10203,"[Months Before His Suicide, Reddit Co-founder Warned Corporations Could Censor the Internet (2013)](https://archive.is/Quqkv)

*While the Internet is generally seen as a beacon for information and openness, he expresses concern that private companies have less restrictions on censoring the Internet than government...*

&gt;*""Private companies are a little bit scarier because they have no constitution to answer to, they‚Äôre not elected really, they don‚Äôt have constituents or voters.""*  

*He says that while proponents against censorship in the private sphere have been successful, advocates of a free Internet should be concerned about both private and public censorship efforts in the future.*

[Interview with former reddit CEO](https://archive.is/uTcEK)

*We stand for free speech. This means* _**we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits.**_ *We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States ‚Äì because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it ‚Äì but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform.*

10226,"It's not fair to hold Judicial Watch responsible for the lack of prosecution of the significant corruption they expose through their FOIA legal actions. It's also irresponsible to suggest their efforts are not essential to preserving the liberty of Americans. 

In a political system such as ours, accountability is provided to the people by placing political appointees in leadership roles for the various agencies that administer our government. When there is no political accountability for a government bureaucracy, the liberty of the people is diminished. 

I would encourage you to watch Tom Fitton's [explanation of JW's mission](https://www.judicialwatch.org/about/#mission) on their website. He describes Judicial Watch as an ""educational foundation"" that uses the FOIA and other tools to investigate government officials so **we** can hold accountable the politicians who commit, condone or attempt to cover-up government corruption. As he explains in the video he included with this post, Tom Fitton is calling out Reddit's censorship of T_D because it is denying their organization an important public forum to educate Americans .

More importantly, JW is one of the few organizations working to expose the deep state bureaucracy that has and continues to conspire to destroy President Trump and his agenda. In my view, their work is nothing short of heroic."

10238,"&gt; to force a move

Let's try using some brainpower here.

Remember when the sub was quarantined for ""threats against police?""  The article that managed to somehow zero in and find a handful of comments made in a place with thousands per day?

Gee, that wasn't a setup at all. Now you're complaining that the remaining mods have temporarily stopped them from doing the exact same thing again. Which is going to change as soon as Reddit finds enough lackeys to re-open the sub as ""Voters_Remorse.""

****
You realize that any argument you make against leaving Reddit, puts you on the side of Reddit, right?

It's not the quarantine that's forcing a move, it's the fact that Reddit is finally making it's move against T_D.

FFS, we've been saying for four years ""We need somewhere to go when they come for us,"" and now you're saying ""No, I want to stay here under the Leftist bootheel.""

- Option A: Start using .win in addition to T_D on Reddit.

- Option B: Ignore .win, badmouth the people advocating a backup position, and insist on staying solely on a platform where you don't have any control. (what you're doing)"

10269,"In order to build a case, you have to gather evidence and submit it for prosecution.

Or are you imagining that some court somewhere is going to issue an injunction against a privately owned website requiring the Reddit admins to stop kicking mods off subs or get a court order before quarantining a sub? And if so, what's to stop the next Democrat administration from stopping the .win mods from silencing the leftists trying to infiltrate it? Those laws protect website owners/operators as much as they protect us.

I'm as unhappy as you are about this travesty against the spirit of Reddit (RIP Aaron), but the terms of service lay out exactly what kind of chicanery the mods allow. At this point, Reddit is eBaum's World, and anyone who expects fair treatment here will learn the error of their assumptions soon enough.

And when it becomes a permabannable offense to downvote a news article gushing with praise of a man having an abortion, the masses will find another site. It's our job to make sure sane sites exist as alternatives in the marketplace of ideas."
10270,"Welcome to that attitude, girl! I've had the same feeling for years now."
10271,"It's not the content that makes that site suck so much, it is its amateurish design and lack of features. It lacks even basic features that make it feel rather plain.

Features like:

* Total/active user count  
* Ability to set number of posts per page  
* Additional Reddit like preferences  

I am also still using a really old version of Firefox and the comment section does not render comments correctly unless I block the CSS which makes the site ugly as hell.

Site problems include:

* [Comments not rendering correctly](https://i.imgur.com/klnrQrn.png)  
* Hot/New/Rising/Top not showing up at all in this old version of Firefox  
* Top feature not working/displaying any post other than ""Top/Last Hour"" in any browser.

When I did try using the .win site for the first time. I spent a lot of time typing out a long reply to someones comment and when I tried to submit it, I was taken to an error page that said something about having to complete a captcha.

WHAT FUCKING CAPTCHA!?!?!?

So apparently, new users have to verify they are Human to post and must have javascript enabled to see this captcha.

This issue could have been better dealt with if:  

* They told you about the captchas and that you need to have JS enabled to see them and verify your account when you created it.  
* Allowed you to verify your email as a way of verifying you are human like Reddit does.  
* They could have displayed error codes under the text input box like Reddit does rather than using a popup element or taking you to a different page if you had JS disabled.

So my comment was gone and I felt defeated and unwilling to try to retype my comment from memory.

It is because of all this bullshit that I will never use the .win site. They had months or even years to work this shit out. Fuck them."

Isn't a platform by definition a public square. I mean that is the basically the business model.

They then say that since you cant force a small town baker in Colorado to bake a gay wedding cake or force aestheticians to wax men's balls, then supposedly by logic you can't protect freedom of speech on digital platforms.

That is wrong.  So the sub can stay live to be used against us?  It's a zombie shell of what it once was. I don't want to live under someone's heel, and that's what this is.

I understand the mods love their job and this was a source of pride, but it's time to let it go. Let them end this place.  It will look bad on them, and you can be a true martyr in a sense.

But you are not helping, in fact you are hurting when you try to keep this place alive.  If they outright ban us, it will really look bad for them.  Banning a sub during election time? The only sub that is conservative? That's election meddling. If you let them keep it alive they can claim it was for rule violations and shit, and they worked to install their own mods.

They will use the same tactics to try and steal the General too."
10676,"&gt; Who‚Äôs base of operations?

President Trump supporters.

&gt; How is going to a safe space going to spread the word and Red Pill the masses?

We're not spreading the word at the win, we are coordinating at the win. We can coordinate there without having to worry about Reddit fuckery."
10677,Please. They censor more than the chinese cuck.
10678,Thank you
10679,Fuck .win!!! They censor more than these chicom clowns do.
10680,"This sub is in lockdown mode so that the remaining mods can moderate it, and people are slowly migrating to .win. Kind of waiting to see what the next dirty trick they pull is."
10681,"I don't mean to be a concern troll, but I wonder if this is an overreaction to steer people to the .win site.  Seems like they've had long enough to sort it out."
10682,"Nice try. Do you feel the same way about the flu and common cold?

Quit fear mongering."
10683,He's a lifelong loser with a loser ideology.
10684,"We only have half the mod team left. There's no way they can mod the amount of content that's posted here and still keep the shills out. What do you think could happen? A shill sneaks some violent racist shit through and the admins have actual ""proof"" to get rid of us. So no it's not about the mods."
10685,"What is his point?  What does this sub have to do with Bernie?  Nothing.  


There are some Bernout sympathizers in this sub.  He's a total loser."
10686,You're right. I keep forgetting a lot of people use their phones for this. I'm on desktop 99.9% of the time so i have a tendency to forget.
10687,Which is why we need to watch him. You don't turn your back on a snake.
10688,"Too obvious, up your game."
10689,Daily reminder that reddit is a commie owned chinese shit hole ran by foreigners and socalist swamp loving limp wrist mindless drones and smelly whales. Shitty servers with shitty contect ran through a shitty app. Democrats are a cancer. Socalism is a scam. Global warming is a scam. Tax is a scam. Soros is an evil ball sacked eyed scum bag. Bill clinton is a rapist. Bread line bernie is a communist. Side of beef hilary will suicide you. He did not kill himself!
10690,"&gt; At this point, reddit is basically a porn site with a radical socialist comment section.

Was it ever anything else?"
10691,"I keep hearing reports that store shelves are going bare, but that's not my experience at all.  The only thing I found gone was Sam's club water yesterday.  They had a ton of other brands, just not theirs but a truck was supposed to be making a delivery that day.

Every store I went into while shopping had stocked shelves and everything was pretty normal, aside from a few people I saw wearing gloves."
10692,"My point is that despite Bernie being a loser, he was a loser with a commanding lead ahead of Biden.  Who then mysteriously pulled a giant lead on Super Tuesday that defied every single poll.

The DNC has systems in place to fudge votes.  They will 100% try the same in the general."
10693,Ah. My mistake.
10694,Ah here come the pro Chinese reddit concern trolls saying that this is all just mod drama and the mods fault... this was predicted... leftist plots are always  so basic

10696,"i do, yes. That will look incredibly bad if we are forced off the site.  It will look like the censorship it is.  That will seriously get reddit sued or in legal trouble.  If we are not banned, they can continue to lie"
10697,"We should all call our representatives, I'll do that tomorrow."
10698,Is every fucking post this guy?  Fuck reddit
10699,That is an average leftist
10700,"I addressed his point of ""nobody can see us"" and ""nobody was able to find us already""

I pointed out that people could still find TD even after quarantine and censorship. It didnt stop TD from growing. 

Dont be stupid yourself."
10701,"You brought up Bernie, asshole.

The point was the second sentence in my post so that you would get it."
10702,Could you add more approved posters? I miss the memes.
10703,"&gt;  It's like saying that you are in an abusive relationship and for you to walk away from it is letting the other person win.

no im not, im saying this is a territory war. They want us gone, we are getting rid of ourselves. Doesnt really matter though, trump will win again then TD wouldve just became a conservative sub after his last term.

&gt;so why the fuck are you trying to appease them?

Who ever said anything about trying to appease them? im just saying fight until the end. To not abandon the front. Instead people seem to want to move to an island to avoid the fight."
10704,"Go the thedonald.win bro, have you not paid attention???"
10705,"Whatever, faggot."
10706,"Why can‚Äôt they just open it back up, not accept new mods, and let Reddit actually take the step of shutting us down.

What‚Äôs happening right now, the slow death of the sub *without* the outrage/fallout of a real shutdown, is a fucking dream come true outcome for the people trying to silence us. 

Wake the fuck up. (Of course, since so many of you are in these threads constantly giving the same weak and flawed logic, I‚Äôm not sure that you don‚Äôt already realize yourself and aren‚Äôt serving an ulterior motive...)"
10707,"Yes. What should have happened is that we all stay on Reddit once the sub was fully shut down and start flooding all other subs with Trump meme, votes, etc. (not brigading because there is no central sub at the heart of it anymore) to overwhelm them, let out righteous outrage be known, and Redpill the masses. The mods here have either been outsmarted or they have betrayed us. 

If you‚Äôre reading this, shitpost all over Reddit and drop as many redpills as you can. If they ban you, make a new account and do it all over again. There are so many of us here and we could make life a living hell for the rest of Reddit if we all did that, which is what we should have been doing the moment this all started."
10708,The aggressive shilling for .Win that seems to always employ the typical shill tactic of shaming should give any pede serious pause in terms of what is happening here.
10709,"We need to get Democrat‚Äôs on record refusing to close the Mexican border. Then when illegals start bringing it along after Mexico‚Äôs healthcare crumbles, they‚Äôll have no leg to stand on."
10710,Then get new mods.  The current mod team got booted and they decided to take the whole sub down with them.  Beyond selfish and damaging in an election year when it is important for this sub to have a presence on this site.
10711,What do you mean watch him?  The one guy is complaining that Biden won Super Tuesday because this sub is closed down.
10712,"They should have refused new mods, let posting continue, and force Reddit to shut down the sub entirely. Then we all would have taken to the other subs with outrage, redpills, votes, etc. in a flurry of activity that would have made a major splash and caught the attention of countless normies.

Instead, this sub is slowly bleeding out without much noise while it‚Äôs business as usual on the rest of Reddit. 

This is the *perfect* outcome for those trying to silence us. Wake up, pedes, we are not winning right now."
10713,It sounds like some of the mods (think some that got kicked by the admins) let all of this happen to go make people go to the .win site. What a joke.
10714,The DNC runs their own polling.  The DNC does not run the general election.  DNC Super delegates do not exist int he general election.  Bernie is a socialist and that does not stand the chance in a general election and he is learning that again in the primaries.  Bernie is a loser.
10715,"Thanks, with no pepes anymore can really use the cutes."
10716,"They should have not accepted mods, kept it open, and forced Reddit‚Äôs hand to shut it down entirely. This current outcome could not be better for those trying to silence us. The slow death of the sub without any resounding outcry or fanfare.

Very poor strategy in play here. It‚Äôs ok to say it. Mods aren‚Äôt infallible and this isn‚Äôt about them. They‚Äôre getting fucking CUCKED."
10717,"I've said nothing that is pro Chinese or pro mod.  Fact of the matter is over the years there has been a lot of mod drama anytime a new mod group takes over for another in this sub and this time the mods are taking the whole sub down with them to try to force people to their offshoot site.


This plays into what the admins of reddit want more than anything else, and that is for there to be no pro-Trump presence on reddit."
10718,Should this place just be renamed the_fitton?
10719,Today on The_Fitton.
10720,I didn't bring up Bernie you stupid fuck.  Look at the string of comments you decided to interject into.

Anyone think the left-wing attendees brought it?"
10724,"Liberals: If they can't control it, they'll try to destroy it."
10725,"You don't get it, shill. Only somebody who was on the side of reddit would victim blame the the mods and act as an everyday T\_D user...

This *exact* course of action (you blaming the mods and making people blame the modes *instead of reddit, the actual villains*) was already predicted by T\_D threads over at .win, and here you are... shilling for reddit

T\_D has been compromised officially for weeks here. Nobody can trust a single motive of any poster anymore here. Moving to .win is actually the smarter play.

This subreddit will become a psyops for reddit to do what they want and concern troll and eventually they'll turn this subreddit into what seems to be anti trump over time but first they have to make us turn against the mods, then some lower level figures, then work their way up to trump"

A democrap politician was cheering someone who said they would go to a Trump rally if they got infected with coronavirus."
10729,I clicked on the gift card link and put spez's name
10730,Dems threatened to bring it to CPAC. And now it happened. Imagine that.
10731,Even with the quarantine there were weekly posts about people jumping on the train after finding this sub so the point you're making is factually untrue.
10732,"How about you shut the fuck up?

Do you behave this way about the flu? No, of course not. Take your feeble libtard controlled mind and get a clean pair of pants and a proper understanding of the virus."
10733,I'm just baffled as to how they're able to get away with it. This is clear and transparent election meddling.
10734,Libtard? You are a joke. Go beat on someone else.
10735,Let you get back to being scared and scaring others with fake news you say? No.
10736,"Yeah, he said Biden, you said Bernie. You sounding like a bitter bernout right now, homie. Check yourself. You still missed the point and now you're getting your BP up."
10737,"Oohhh- you need to change your screen name to one more fitting.

How about Jokedy-Doo-Dah!!!"
10738,"The_Donald really has basically become The_Fitton in all but name, hasn't it?"
10739,Cry all you want.
10740,"as of right now, it's still not a huge deal right now. If I get the coronavirus today, I might not even notice....now people of POTUS's age :/"
10741,"Go watch your gay porn, coomer, and leave the adults alone."
10742,"Wow, what a stance to take. Amazing."
10743,Meme energy carried us last election cycle. Memes are important and honestly memes are really backed up because of reddit censorship. It is as you say eventually the content will balance out.
10744,"Go to thedonald.win.  It's our only real choice.  reddit is colluding with the other Left social media sites - google, youtube, facebook, twitter, etc. to shut down conservative speech."
10745,"Ok, bitch.."
10746,It's got language in it that violates the content policy. It's not rocket science to figure that out and making a sticky out of it was bad strategy.
10747,Nope. No such thing.
10748,"If I recall correctly, that is how T_D started as well.  It was a bunch of memes initially."
10749,Hand sanitizer. That is the thing that is going off the shelves like crazy.  Its scary to think people never cared before this.  Its nothing but the flu anyways and the people it hits tends to be the normal people who die anyways from any other illness.
10750,"Now if you want to view you have to verify your email - Reddit ""leadership"" sucks."
10751,"this is their burning of the reichstag. nobody is allowed to think anything else than what the Nazis that want to unmask people that make fun of their favored political candidates and ruin their lives for posting memes. They cannot win the battle of ideas, and have been allowed to get away with pushing the water to its edge with the quarantine and all the suppression (changing the way things go to the front page) just because they have not been challenged. At a certain point, people will wake up but then again I am not any better. We need to keep spreading the message and alert people to the unsuppressed truth. Why do they get to vet every single moderator? Where do they derive that right? Do they interview the moderators of anywhere else? Probably not."
10752,what goes around comes around like tetherball baby.
10753,cannot give up our homeland. we shall not surrender our country to  the false song of globalism.

10757,"
At least he's trying to fill the void. I appreciate he's still here and giving us *something* new each day instead of having the newest thread be from 4 days ago."
10758,Bullshit. It takes less than 2 minutes to get registered and login. Unless you log out your browsers cookies will keep you logged in after that.
10759,You know there are going to be a lot of leftists happy about this. How evil..
10760,That's not what he said at all. You are misinterpreting everything. Somebody said the Dems plan to cheat. He implied that that is how Biden won Super Tuesday. Go back to bed and try again later.

10766,Excellent. I hope it's broadcast. She should have to answer for her monumental fuck up.
10767,The testimony must happen by May 16.
10768,"Hey Tom, be sure to post at thedonald.win also. God Bless You!"
10769,She doesn't recall anything.
10770,Congrats on that big W. Justice must be served.
10771,Can you get reddit to testify?
10772,The courts opinion is worth reading: https://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JW-v-State-Hillary-Deposition-Order-01242.pdf
10773,"Because admins are making money off of .win, of course they want everyone to go there."

10779,"She's going to set the world record for number of ""I do not recall""

Sadly, nothing will come of this."
10780,Then Tom Fitton will ask how she's expected to be the president when she has the memory span of a garden slug.
10781,Bill Barr should take lessons from Judicial Watch.
10782,"It's a shame they can't deputize a few of the more long-time members to report, at least."
10783,"Your hard work and perseverance is so appreciated, Tom.

Thank you for fighting for justice."
10784,"If this comes off, you will have questioned Hillary longer than the FBI did."
10785,"As much as I appreciate your work, Tom. I‚Äôm pretty much done with this sub. There are other pro Trump subs on reddit where we can still KAG. This sub is dead as Hillary‚Äôs vagina."

10787,"Fitton isnt the bad guy here. 

TD mods could be doing more."
10788,Sessions and Barr joined forces to let the statute of limitations run out on Hillary's crimes. But I'm glad she'll at least have to sweat. Mr. Fitton won't hesitate to ask her how a person with no memory to speak of imagined that they were qualified to be POTUS.
10789,Youve been added to a watch list.
10790,Im placing bets on this as well.
10791,"""You can't expect me to learn anything but a BlackBerry"""
10792,She won't go to jail. But she will look idiotic for not being able to remember anything for hours on end. Shouldn't a potential president have some semblance of a functional brain/memory?

10796,"""fuck up"" is a funny way to spell 'crime'."
10797,"&gt; They will most likely let things continue

This is what I think. They want our traffic, but they don't want US. They want us to keep coming here so they don't have to tell their advertisers that they lost nearly a million (or more) subscribers at once."
10798,"what the hell is up with this guy posting his own articles, with pictures of him trying to show off his arms? lol fucking hell, i guess this is one of the ""mods"" chosen by reddit"
10799,"Barr learned what he knows about justice from 30+ years in DC.

That's his problem."
10800,"I‚Äôm confused...what‚Äôs happening? Why are these the only posts on this sub, is something going on?"

10803,Why are we only seeing Fitton content now?
10804,"I get you, and while you're *morally right,* this is their house, and if you're in the house of an insane asshole, why not just fucking leave and build your own house?  That's what TD.W is now.  It's our own fucking house.  None of Reddit's oppression, suppression, manipulation, etc. happens there."
10805,Would not it be better to stay closed (unless they reinstate the banned mods) and move to the .win?
10806,"https://imgur.com/I4E6Byl.jpg kek.

True, I'm 51 years old and I've never seen anything go back to the way it was before, let's both hope that for once it does though."
10807,"At this point, she could've forgotten everything, AGAIN!"
10808,Legend!
10809,"It just sucks that she will never be held to pay for her crimes. It's crazy that the same people who wanted Trump impeached because of the russia hoax and the Ukrainian bullshit are the same people who were backing hillary clinton without a single problem in 2016. Leftist senators like shitbag schumer, pelosi, nadler, and a host of others didn't even say ""boo"" about her private server and other scandals. It sure as shit seems like a two tiered justice system."
10810,"He's the guy that came out and said the ""Government Report"" on the Pentagon was complete and accurate - it was Flight 77 that hit the Pentagon (clear as day!!) He, Tom Fitton SAW the *evidence* (so just believe him, mmmkay?!) and all the ""conspiracy nuts"" can shut up now...but yep - JW and Fitton personally spoke on camera and IMNHO **covered up a crime scene** at the Pentagon and 9/11 events. 


That begs the question about the posibility that Fitton and JW might just be some Odd Ball Clearing House???? WTH knows at this damned LATE DATE!!!"
10811,Of course they do. They just don't want to get their own hands dirty doing it.
10812,"Because he is like one of the only approved posters.

10842,Thank you and please stay safe. I guarantee you they are digging up anything they can on you and if that fails they‚Äôll get a donor to accuse you of something from 35 years ago.
10843,"The 5th Amendment to the Constitution of the USA has lots of provisions, from the double jeopardy clause (you can be tried only once in a federal court for a given offense) to the grand jury clause (the right to be tried only upon indictment by a Grand Jury in the case of felonies). 

When a defendant ""pleads the 5th"", he/she's particularly invoking the  right to decline to answer questions when the answers could/would incriminate them. It's not a right that applies only for politicians, but for every defendant and witness in a criminal case.

The text of the Bill of Rights might be dry and even technical sometimes, but it's very important for every citizen of the US to know their rights."
10844,"He's the guy that came out and said the ""Government Report"" on the Pentagon was complete and accurate - it was Flight 77 that hit the Pentagon (clear as day!!) He, Tom Fitton SAW the evidence (so just believe him, mmmkay?!) and all the ""conspiracy nuts"" can shut up now...but yep - JW and Fitton personally spoke on camera and IMNHO covered up a crime scene at the Pentagon and 9/11 events.

That begs the question about the posibility that Fitton and JW might just be some Odd Ball Clearing House???? WTH knows at this damned LATE DATE!!!


Where did all of Senator Bob Grahams Evidence go from the Saudi Boxes retrieved from the *crime scene* of the Saudi Family that were allowed to fly out of the US?


Where did the Two Jesuit Forensic Investigators go with all of the Clinton Foundation Evidence? Tom was sitting right there behind them and Mark Meadows was having a coronary because these Jesuits wouldn't **give Meadows** their work? Now Meadows gets a WH position?"

10851,"That's my bday, thanks for the early present Mr. Fitton"
10852,"&gt; Then get new mods.

The admins won't let that happen unless they personally accept the new mods.

Didn't you follow what is actually going on ?  The admins kicked out half the mod team then said to only accept new mods they personally select.

Read the stickies instead of spouting nonsense."
10853,Nice!
10854,"It's interesting news but I can't find a single thing when I search for it online. I remember saying this ages ago - even when these people have to start answering for their crimes, the normies will be none the wiser because the media doesn't tell anyone jack shit. Obama and Hillary could be in jail for child sacrifice and no one would have a clue."
10855,"Exactly what a faggot would come back with, LOL!"
10856,"No, you didn't address anything.  You made an uneducated response which said ""people can find us here"" while pretending that people won't be able to find us on .win.  Here's a fun fact, it's EASIER to find us on .win than it is to find us here on reddit.  You don't need a verified email address to see it.  But somehow you ""addressed"" the point of it by pretending that because we had growth that it means there weren't any issues with people finding T_D.

You realize what quarantined means right?  You realize that it's only the first problem with the subreddit with the bigger problem being that even if people find the subreddit, it doesn't mean that they'll even be able to see what they want because reddit still dictates what shows up and doesn't.

So, no, I'm not being stupid, I'm just not ignoring what you are ignoring.  Once again, go ahead and address the points being made because you STILL HAVEN'T DONE IT."
10857,"&gt; They should have refused new mods, let posting continue, and force Reddit to shut down the sub entirely.

Then the admins would have simply installed mods, and turned this place into a leftist hellhole.

It's better this way."
10858,something something i plead the fifth
10859,I predict next post Tom will remove his shirt.
10860,"&gt;Who ever said anything about trying to appease them? 

You.  You want to stay around here, you are either going to have to appease them or do you think cowering in the leftover pond of what reddit gives us is you ""fighting til the end"".  I'd rather win the war than win a fight where everything is stacked against us."

10877,"The sub has not been taken over yet. Reddit submitted a list of 36 'approved' mods for the remaining T_D mods to select from. The T_D mods say they will have to investigate them and that it will take a long, long, long time to do this because before they turn the keys over to this wreck of a sub they've left us, they have to be sure the new mods aren't going to wreck the sub.

10885,"Huh, they 1984'd the post above you.  Fancy that."
10886,"Agree with the publisher vs platform....my only point is that we don't want to force government intervention otherwise it can be used to dictate how we run our platforms.  We are voluntarily using this platform. They don't have to even let us be on here.  Sure, there would be massive public outlash and that's probably why I'm still able to type this... But the 1st Amendment is there to protect us against government infringement. Us being censored here doesn't prevent us from voicing our opinions elsewhere. 

I for one have been keen on setting up infrastructure..... I just can't do it for about 5 more years... Plz don't ask why.... I'm sure there's enough of us here who could do it .. just someone with less IRL restrictions."

10949,"Some people are expressing their annoyance that you're pretty much the only person left who is able to post on this sub, but please don't let it get you down. All this frustration is really aimed at the owners of Reddit.

You're doing excellent work, and if we're able to actually have Hillary Clinton sit there and testify, you'll have done more than anyone else over the past four years when it comes to the infamous server.

By the way, since only approved users can post on this sub, wouldn't that mean that the president could maybe post something here? That'd infuriate a few people, I wager."
10950,Reminder that Spez and the Admins of Reddit are beta cucks. I pray to God that they are found guilty of meddling in an election and refusing  the freedom of speech of the American People with a monumentally long federal prison sentence as a warning to others.

Are you saying TD.win has an inferior user interface or that the site is inferior because there aren't 10 million socialist cucks there like there is with Reddit? If it is the interface, then make suggestions, offer to code a better site. I agree that it is basic and needs android/ios apps. 

Reddit is a Leftist shithole at this point. Discussion websites/Forums/Bulletin Boards come and go, I've seen many in my 30+ years of internet browsing. Reddit is hastening their own demise."

The truth is, allowing reddit admins or the moderators of this sub to shut us down and force us to a small site only we know about, one that's completely disconnected from one of the largest sites in the world, amounts to another victory for big tech in the culture war they're waging. Some of you koolaid drinkers seem convinced that saying ""fuck reddit, we'll show you!"" and isolating ourselves to a random website that barely functions is the correct move,  but it's not. Reddit doesnt need us. We do drive traffic to the site, but they will be fine without us, and that's the truth.

By isolating our message,  we will continue to lose ground in this culture war. This sub reddit was integral in bringing young people to the political right in 2016. Without this sub, I cant say for certain I would've voted for trump. I believe the damage is already done - even if the site is taken out of restricted mode it won't be the same. But just know that the mods were complicit in its death."

11025,Hmmm....why are they not showing the online pedes? Censorship of this sub is really bad
11026,"What the untold fuck is actually wrong with you.

Damn."
11027,"I'm staying here until all the mods, past and new put out a joint statement. The current situation is ridiculous."
11028,"Then I'll take my chances with the reddit admins appointing new mods. 

I'd trust them just as much as what the mods here did to T_D."
11029,"That's my state lol, but it works both ways"
11030,I guess we'll just rename this sub The_Fitton
11031,"That's great, however, I don't think she's dumb enough to spill the beans. She will just give BS answers or don't recall. But it's still cool she's bruh dragged into a hearing."
11032,Tom you‚Äôre doing phenomenal work!  Ignore the trolls on here until we are back and up and running.
11033,"‚ÄúIf you could refresh my recollection on that matter I might be able to recall what you want me to recall, but at this particular time I do not recall the particulars of that particular matter.‚Äù **- Jimmy Hoffa**"

11037,"Wow, just found out I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot allowed to post‚Äù to r/The_Donald"
11038,"From what I‚Äôve gathered:

Reddit admins booted a bunch of T_D mods and began selecting replacements.

T_D mods locked down the subreddit to a strict list of ‚Äúapproved posters.‚Äù

The end is nigh.

TheDonald.Win and/or r/Trump"
11039,I know Iran is
11040,"Anyone notice, Hillary's avoiding many public appearances now?

She'll just post a picture or tweet here and there...

Meanwhile, in her 2016 campaign, she's collapsing, shitting her pants, whenever in public?

Wonder how long the charade will last."
11041,"We have moved to https://TheDonald.win

Reddit came in and banned over half the mods and said only reddit approved mods are allowed from now on. Then they threatened to ban a huge chunk of user base for upvoting. The few remaining mods locked down submissions because they could no longer keep up and reddit has not given us the new commie mods yet...

The admins refuse to allow T_D to close and have reopened it. They would prefer to control who allows content and what is upvoted."
11042,"""Ladies and Gentleman, introducing our new President of the United States of America, the ONLY surviving member of the infamous and dreadful Coronavirus Covid-19, &lt;drum roll&gt; Tulsi Gabard!!!""

Yea, she still hasn't withdrawn, and is the only candidate under 70, lol."
11043,"Yeah, Reddit made a little loophole into banning us by removing all our mods and they're essentially selecting the new ones. The sub has too many viewers to go unmoderated so they had to limit it to only a few people until they can hopefully regain control.

Otherwise, a backup was planned months ago at https://thedonald.win. Completely out of Reddit, China, and ShariaBlue's control."
11044,Because liberals defend their own
11045,There is an unofficial open source app that I'm using. I won't recommend it since it is still unofficial. I believe there is a second app in development as well.
11046,"The dem politicians and pundits aren't *blaming* the fact that the virus exists on Trump. They're blaming our lack of preparation and handling of it in the US on Trump.

So idk how you get that China is blaming the US from that."
11047,NO MORE TOM PICTURES. Downvoted for not linking the story
11048,"The ATT breakup proves you wrong. If reddit is a platform then it is required to allow wrongthought, as it is a PUBLIC FORUM (as one of the courtcases from alabama involving the JW group and ""private""streets confirmed). Additionally ATTs monopoly was broken up and one of the rulings was that ATT cant ban or block service for calls where the user says wrongthought."
11049,rename the sub to the_fitton....
11050,"Yea, I think he's in on it."
11051,Censorship.
11052,This is huge. It‚Äôs a shame this is the only place I‚Äôm hearing of this.

11055,"This guy is trying hard, I get it. Good on him. But she will never show up in a courtroom on this. It's not happening.

Tom ""the arms"" Fitton, just stop."
11056,"But that's not the origen of the context of the term.

It's from a canary in a coal mine. It was just a canary in a cage, and so long as it's alive the mines air is safe."

But ruining our sub and the Ruskies ssf sponsoring Bernie are both ok"
11066,"Admins changed rules.  Said upvoting rulebreaking content can be a bannable offense.  Then, within hours they nuked 18 of our long time mods, including myself.  Fuck reddit, fuck the admins.  Join us here:  https://thedonald.win/  Built and ran entirely by TD mods (many of us banned from modding on reddit)."
11067,"Because they accuse us of being cultists, while simultaneously acting like a cult...

They believe any nonsense, any lie, as long as it gets reported by a left enough leaning source.

They are bullies, who think they are smarter then others, while in truth they are morons who believe that ‚ÄúObama is responsible for the current economy‚Äù. 

It is good that at least something is happening though.

But does Trump know what is going on here?"
11068,"It just means, ‚ÄúYes, but I don‚Äôt want to incriminate myself, and if I say no, that‚Äôs a lie under oath.‚Äù"
11069,Guess we'll wait 75 days for nothing then
11070,According to what source and when
11071,The_fitton
11072,The sub is shut down so only approved submitters are allowed to post content. Tom Fitton is one of the few approved submitters.

11074,"Now Joe Biden is going to have to pick her as VP candidate, so that she cannot be investigated."

11084,"It's called a joke, snowflake."
11085,This is /r/The_Fitton now. Report to the weight room in the morning!
11086,"&gt;probably because hillary isn‚Äôt on the ballot yet

""yet"" 

It will be her or the guy married to Barack.   

How will it arise? Take your pick:   

A) Bernie will win... and then have a heart attack and die.   

B) Bernie's votes won't be ""stolen"" like last time. Rather, the votes Bernie worked to get will be taken from him by DNC authorities and redistributed to Biden who needs them more, whereas that is ""democratic socialism"".  Then Biden will have an unfortunate mental breakdown. 

Gosh, who could take their place?"
11087,Reddit is to the\_donald as Hitler was to Jews.

11103,"This is now the_fitton, which is not a bad thing by itself.  The_Donald is now free from deadit, and is out redpilling in the wilderness.

When I sort by new I see nothing.  Sorting by ""hot"" I only see posts from Fitton and they are all dated days ago.  Sorting by ""top today"" yields 1 post.

Wtf?"

11128,"Nothing about the rules restrict mods to be leftist. 


You're dumbass is playing into exactly what the admins want."
11129,"That isn't what they were saying. 

Shilling for win is starting to get annoying at this point.

You can pussy out from the fight to your echo chamber but I will be here until the final nail is hammered in."
11130,"Hijacking an unlocked post: When does this bullshit end and we start posting freely again? No one gives a shit about the admins or their opinions. We don't give a shit about hiring China's feelings with truth. They bought a company in a country that values free speech. Don't like it, ya Commie cowards? Then fuck right off and buy something else. We have power over them, but we're acting like past Republicans reaching across the aisle to kiss our enemy's ass. Fuck that! Bring back the open posting and let the chips fall where they may! They threaten to ban us, but they also know the repercussions for doing so. It will cause an uproar and Reddit will be in the crosshairs of the FEC and others if they do. **LET'S QUIT THIS PUSSY SHIT AND START POSTING AGAIN! MAKE THEM TAKE US DOWN!!!**"
11131,"They need to drag this out at the very least, bc this witch is going to try for a VP to Biden, then kill him."
11132,"I agree. They don't want to let go, but I am not likely to go to an actual echo chamber that is mildly inconvenient, reminds me more of mobile Reddit than I'd like, etc.


I would not mind a new batch of mods who are long standing members of this community to take over. Perhaps I should have tried to apply in the end, though I have a feeling with the constant trolling from the left that it's a never ending job"

Ok, reddit."

11162,"Yeah something something let God sort em
out."
11163,Go to TheDonald.win.
11164,It‚Äôs locked down for everyone right now because half the mods were removed and the remaining felt they didn‚Äôt have the manpower to mod the sub effectively.
11165,"Users can keep commenting though to keep the sub alive. Just use an old post to supply new Information. The only way this sub wins is to keep the users active or migrate to a new sub over and over again, or have so many they can't keep up. Beat them at their own game and exploit the loopholes."

11169,Reddit is a joke.
11170,"Reddit is a fucking joke. 
Admins and commie mods can suck my white dick."
11171,reddit killed freedom of speech.
11172,Because the ownership of Reddit is censoring us.
11173,"This guy uses derogatory terms about women, mods please ban."
11174,This guy distributes child porn.  Mods please ban.
11175,Even with the censorship memes from here see millions of eyes per day.
11176,Mods are fags. They should have shut down this site if they cared so much about optics.
11177,Its really beginning to feel like they just wanted to move TD to their website for the clout.
11178,"&gt;Let the admins ban every one of us if it comes to that

I'd rather not have this sub banned."
11179,"I am on thedonald.win. 

Have simultaneously transcribed the rallies on both sites for the last several--until the_donald had no rally thread to write to. 

I am very much around and posting on thedonald.win same user name. Thanks for the compliment, but we want to compliment the President. He is taking heat from all of people Cramer on CNBC for the stock market crisis. The Saudis and Russians are playing oil games now and Cramer wants GEOTUS to do something. Idiots abound."

11185,Or if they somehow obtained a sample of a certain leader's blood and engineered it to be very effective against his DNA and others like it.

11187,First time I‚Äôve ever been accused of being a leftist.
11188,Either get her to admit to serious crime or get her in a perjury trap. Use her past statements against her. Ask why it was too difficult to manage two email accounts on one BlackBerry. Ask about Seth Rich. Ask where the Haiti money went. Ask how much she or the family slush fund received from foreign sources.
11189,"Me, too. But I doubt they'd ever ""subject"" the Queen to the peasants of the public."
11190,"This is simply not true, it's so you can't be required to self incriminate yourself.

In a criminal case the burden of proof is on the prosecutor."
11191,"You mods are stupid for pushing people to .win

Notice Reddit has no problem with you constantly spamming .win ads? Because you are giving Reddit exactly what they want. You are helping them fuck T_D users because YOU are the ones who have stifled freedom of speech here, not them.

Also if they ever feel the need to shut down .win their lawyers could probably get it done easily because .win is clear cut theft of Reddit's proprietary design. 

Get out of the way, this place will survive without you."
11192,"perhaps ""indelibly recorded in her hypothalamus"" or whatever bs Blasey-Ford tried spouting on about?"
11193,Activating amnesia mode............
11194,"meanwhile, over in the politics sub or anywhere else on reddit, people are actively cheering for corona virus to take out trump's base and even trump himself.

What a bunch of pathetic losers."
11195,"Reddit admins started issuing warnings that the act of upvoting content that they didn't agree with would result in users being banned. They made it perfectly clear that unless this subreddit changed its fundamental nature, then it would be banned. They then came in and banned nearly all of the active moderators of the subreddit and said they would replace those mods with people they prescreened.

The few remaining mods decided that they couldn't moderate this place on their own with the new restrictions, and allowing the admins to install their own mods was unacceptable. The idea of the canary is to let everyone know if Reddit installs their own mods and opens the subreddit back up and pretends nothing happened. As long as the ""canary"" is alive, that hasn't happened. If the message changes, that means the original mods are letting us know that the admins and their hand-picked mods are now running the subreddit."
11196,"Your prayer will be denied. YouTube is as arbitrary &amp; unfair as Reddit. Dennis Prager took YT/Google to court over PragerU being throttled. He lost. The Ninth Circuit said in sum, ""Their house, their rules, &amp; Prager's a guest"". 

Spez isn't happy he can't ban zombie T_D because of appearances, but if all the *disgusting deplorable* people on his platform can do now is respond to Tom Fitton, well...."
11197,100% agreed. This feels like giving up rather than fighting on. It‚Äôs even worse than nuking this place to oblivion.
11198,Can anyone confirm that reddit wont allow closure of the sub?
11199,Wasn't this announced over a week ago?
11200,She‚Äôs gonna recall how to Arkancide someone if she feels backed into a corner by all of this. Tommy Fitton better be packin heat at all times and well guarded.

11204,"Stay safe. The memes are real.  People like to commit ""suicide"" in convenient times around her."
11205,Add water to it and let it soak. Rinse and repeat
11206,The Admins have no issue assigning literal Pedophiles as mods as well.  Its thier go to tactic to bring down the credibility of subs
11207,Threw her like a side of beef...
11208,"that isn't what i insinuated, retard."
11209,"That‚Äôs why doxxing is such a popular thing leftists do. They want t just ‚Äúharmlessly‚Äù click a few things on the internet without consequence, then thousands of people will slur on you and your baby girl and you puppy, then you live in constant fear about people attacking your baby girl after everyone on Antifa know where your baby girl and 83 year old Mum lives. 

To them they are so low energy (and the SF ones don‚Äôt even have a car often) and so cowardly they won‚Äôt show up to beat your mum but they always ‚Äúwishes someone should‚Äù and would be a bonus if someone did. Tell me how this isn‚Äôt terrorist tactics."
11210,"why would you even make this statement?

there is absolutely no memes being ""voted to the top here"" because no one can even upload (except a tiny select few like Fitton).

this censorship is absolutely horseshit that shouldn't have been allowed and shouldn't even be legal, and it is working."

11216,"oh okay well right now we're getting fucked off this platform basically entirely with a sub-standard one that has 0 reach as a replacement being offered while no one with any kind of authority even seems to want to discuss this issue despite Trump himself having done an AMA on this subreddit in 2015 and the subreddit basically being one of the primary reasons he was elected in 2016. 

meanwhile zero individuals who actually fucked with the 2016 election have been indicted so they have attempted to impeach/convict trump twice so far and are actively fucking with the 2020 election. 

but yeah we're totally adapting and overcoming."
11217,"Yeah, the Left is corrupt as fuck and they use every dirty trick they can think of. This isn't new. President Trump is in the white house, they're not. He is in a good position to win 2020 and take the house back.

I understand your frustration but just complaining isn't helping."
11218,ignoring reality and acting like this subreddit is in the best position ever because of finely crafted memes (even though there is 0 because this subreddit is de facto shut down) is as far away from helping as I can imagine.

If they're socialists, tell the story about their capitalistic ways. It's easy to feed these people to their own crowd. We KNOW all their triggers. Sure, it's not true what you're saying.. but when has the truth ever been useful to a leftist? They're looking for scapegoats and nazis. Let's give it to them by pointing to their own and the impossible standards.."

11239,"I thought Reddit was taking over TD, but it looks more like Tom Fitton took it over."
11240,"&gt; Reddit is a place for conversation, and in that context, we define this behavior as anything that works to shut someone out of the conversation through intimidation or abuse, online or off. Depending on the context, this can take on a range of forms, from directing unwanted invective at someone to following them from subreddit to subreddit, just to name a few.

Wow, if they actually enforced this, I might not hate the rest of Reddit. Too bad they have no intention whatsoever of doing so."
11241,"Breitbart is alt-right, lol.  That's how they put a label on an undesirable source to keep normies afraid of what they write."
11242,"This is it. Pedes, keep an eye on Fitton. He‚Äôs been too public to Suicide but now she might get desperate."
11243,Have you received CNN‚Äôs permission to meme about CNN like that?
11244,It was documented in the drama that followed reddit threatening to ban the majority of the subscribers. One of the mods was banned for repeatedly trying to close it down. You could probably find someone's record of it in one of the drama subs.
11245,This thread isn't locked...mods must be asleep right now.
11246,They are pursecuting my own kind. Fuck you reddit nazis!! Bring back my brother brick bot god damn it!

We need to stay here."
11249,"Mods for other subs go through that subs vetting process.  Your extra period ellipsis bullshit doesn't make sense.  Mod our sub, go through our vetting?"
11250,Dang you got me there. Off to the gulag for me
11251,"What we need to do is brigade other subs non stop.

We need to spread out ALL over Reddit."
11252,"Why did the mods here kill t_d?

Reddit didn't do this.  The mods killed it themselves."

Not sure if we will have time to discuss Wuhan virus and stock market..."
11256,Thank you Tom!  I‚Äôll be watching.
11257,"Awesome - keep us posted!  As always, thanks for doing the heavy lifting!"
11258,Lots of shadowbanned people in this thread. Almost 80% of comments not showing up.

Please bring up the issue of censorship in the future, and Voter ID"

11265,They're bleeding out this sub at the cyclic rate
11266,Please leave your sleeve's at the door. Shmedium shirts only
11267,This is all on purpose and there should be a legal consequence for shutting this place down for free speech. But guess what? Reddit is a private entity and can play good cop while being dirty cops. Shocking? Not really.
11268,"Didn't you hear? Chinese overlords don't want people calling it ""Wuhan virus"". Don't get yourself banned from Reddit!"

11277,"Yeah, that‚Äôs what I heard also. But i have to ask, how is the secret service allowed to turn away someone with court orders signed by a judge and notarized?"
11278,How many days has it been since this latest attempt at election interference?  Reddit has to be noticing the traffic decrease.
11279,Look at the comment count vs the number of actual comments. Enjoy your new communist overlords. I'm sure reddit controlled moderation will be a blast.
11280,Look at the comment count vs the actual number of comments. They are in the process of fine tuning automodderation to delete random comments. It's only a matter of time before they unveil the new censorship in all its glory.
11281,"I got 3 wanings, including 1 for upvoting wrongthink.   Am I shadowbanned?
