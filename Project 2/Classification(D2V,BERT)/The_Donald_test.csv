11293,"&gt; Wuhan virus

The WuhanFluhan.

China launches a bioweapon, on purpose or because the people there in the lab take the experimental animals home as pets or something else, and now governments of the West are going to borrow billions more dollars from China so they can assist Chinese-owned businesses or those who rely on a Chinese ""supply chain"".

There is something that should be sent to China, a bill for all the damage they have caused.

Since communist collaborators exist in most governments of the West, there will only be capitulation to China.  This is nothing to do with Joe Biden and how he flew his drug addict son to China on Air Force Two so his son could be given a billion dollars by China.

&gt; TORONTO (NEWS 1130) ‚Äî Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is warning against a rise of racism towards the Chinese community as the new coronavirus continues to worry some Canadians.

&gt; At a Lunar New Year event in Toronto on Saturday, Trudeau said anti-Chinese sentiments are not welcome in Canada.

&gt; ‚ÄúLet me be clear. There is no place in our country for discrimination driven by fear or misinformation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis not something Canadians will ever stand for.‚Äù

Also Moron Trudeau.  Discriminating against a Chinese man with his/her disinformation.

&gt; Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also commented on the incident in a Cabinet meeting Friday afternoon.

&gt; ‚ÄúMy heart goes out to the young girl who was attacked, seemingly for her religion‚Ä¶ I want her and her family and her friends and community to know that that is not what Canada is ‚Äî that is not who Canadians are.‚Äù

.

&gt; Suspect is: Asian, 20's, medium build, 5'8-6'0, black hair

&gt; -Moustache, glasses, black hoodie, black pants

&gt; Reports he cut her hijab off

Spez: the reason this sub is like this now is to prevent the complete ban from reddit. If shills can't brigade they cant post shit that'll get us banned, no need for China approved mods. Its a shitty situation but it's better to keep it up than get it shutdown if big news comes. Lots of people still don't want to switch over to .win for some reason"

11392,"The mods have locked down the users who can post because reddit has dictated to The_Donald that they need to integrate reddit approved mods. So to keep down ‚Äúdissenting opinions‚Äù The_Donald is grounded to just comment posts and basically 4-5 people who can post. 

Neutered the subreddit, and it‚Äôs very obviously not that different from any other political sub on this site. It‚Äôs not like other subs are standing up for free speech like The_Donald did during the Orlando shooting. It‚Äôs pathetic that so much of reddit was born yesterday to forget that."

I watched mods remove rule breaking content routinely. I see on the new website almost none of this content.

Interestingly, I have started to see posts like yours. I don't believe posts like yours are from actual Trump supporters.

I just don't believe there is any reason to stop new threads on this subreddit other than to redirect traffic.  We are giving the admins EXACTLY what they want while the mods get more traffic to their other site.

I can accept a difference of opinion but to call me ""not an actual Trump supporter"" is just idiotic and immature.  People can disagree while still supporting the same candidate. I was attending Trump rallies before he was even the Republican candidate.  So take your bullshit elsewhere.

11490,"I‚Äôve been calling it ‚Äúthe Wuhans‚Äù (e.g. Our ‚Äúnews‚Äù media keeps trying to blame President Trump for the Wuhans, but if that shit takes a hold of Skid Row, they‚Äôre not going to want to mention how Pelosi, her nephew the Governor, or any other ‚Äúdemocrat‚Äù hasn‚Äôt been able to produce even the tiniest of Utopias). 

Calling it ‚Äúthe Wuhans‚Äù isn‚Äôt illegal. If someone, even if EVERYONE thinks it‚Äôs some kind of ist-phobic-ism... etc., it‚Äôs still not illegal, not ‚Äúbullying‚Äù (able-minded adults thinking they‚Äôre a victim of bullying is embarrassingly ridiculous- fact), discrimination, ‚Äúhate‚Äù or terror... Calling it ‚Äúthe Wuhans‚Äù doesn‚Äôt actively attack Trump, anyone who doesn‚Äôt actively attack Trump, or America, though. Gotta ban anything that might deviate from an existence of ‚Äú2 minutes of hate‚Äù against America."
11491,"The already claim town square status. That is why they cant be sued for things people post on here. Because of that they are not a private platform in the sense that they have a right to censor speech they dont like. They must follow the laws of the land as if they were a gov agency. Like all utilities. The fact that all these conservative lawyers sit on their ass instead of filing suits, to press this issue, &amp; the fact that the conservative supreme court hasnt ruled in favor of this obvious case, shows how weak the elitists in the conservative world really are.

You know who is even worse then them? The full blood MAGA people who argue against regulating Social Media. The ones who say ""What happens when the dems are in charge and they have the regulatory powers"".

Its probably the dumbest and weakest argument possible. Yes it could be abused but they will be held accountable to the law and oversight by congress and the American people. Unlike the people who are regulating these sites now. They are as left and as biased as it comes and dont have to answer to anyone. The gov couldnt come close to weaponizing these sites, against their political rivals, as much as those in charge now, already do."

11496,"The history of this sub will become prime evidence of how 'tech' companies (social media platforms) can be weapons/tools of propagandists. 

What upsets the soi bois is how often we - as an organic, multi-gorillion-core processed computer are more effective than any AI or central agency's directive.

L√© Reddit is an insignificant bit of digital territory and we've shown that the overlords cannot abide an alternate opinion to the declining morals that poison society today. The enemies of The West‚Ñ¢ encourage deviant behavior and selfish people of weak character embrace and encourage thoughts that cause misery and death - even to innocent children and the unborn.

11500,"It seems to me that the coordinated fuckery between L√© Reddit here and pressure on .win's original hosts has required the full attention of the mods who created .win - the sudden influx of visitors - both good and bad - means that in order to protect the new site from Voat-like ugliness it needs close monitoring. 

I've already seen an organic shift in community involvement, but it's a skirmish here and there when the haters drop in.

I appreciate that the mods have declined crowd sourcing funds to keep the site up for now, but I would expect at some point of traffic demand it wouldn't be improper to allow some way of at least offsetting expenses. I would believe that moving to the new host was an increase in cost, and .win will likely need support after the general election to be a fair sounding board to support GEOTUS through his second term - and help define future MAGA candidates and issues."

11698,"The subreddit is closed by the mods, not by the admins.  If you really want a response, tell the admins to let T_D manage it's own moderators like every other subreddit out there and quit interfering with it.  

Until then though, the sub is being put in restricted mode by the mods because losing half of the moderation team because of pissy reddit admins would be like the Spartan 300 was only the Spartan 100 which can't fight off the shills and posers trying to use the subreddit to fuel their bigotry and hatred of Trump."

And reddit loses in this deal across the board.  On one side, they lose the traffic and they lose credibility, but on the other side, they lose their control over the narrative with Trump supporters.  As we enter this election season, do you think they are going to play fair?  No, they are going to be deleting any posts that don't fit the narrative just like facebook and twitter are doing.  They are going to try to control the narrative and because they hold the cards, they can do it and the best we can do is whine about it."

Which as a moderator I can say is very, very dickish of them. And so the mods here want to have temporary positions because of the workload that such a large subreddit attracts a lot of trolls and people who make trouble or spam and whatever else. They think maybe by spreading out the people who are taking the risk they might be able to avoid Reddit forcibly removing important mods from their sub and or banning their accounts, I would use or make an alt for it if you want to help them out."

1.	close the sub until enough mods were in place to properly moderate, or

2.	leave the sub open and risk the sub being permanently banned. 

The admin‚Äôs direct actions forced the mod‚Äôs hand. Admins gave no time for current mods to prepare. Admins knew EXACTLY what they were doing. They know that directly banning T_D would have a ton of negative PR, so they made it look like the mods are the ones responsible."

Some are then unlucky enough to end up having SJW parents that will ruin their kids to virtue signal to their allies.

So I think that brainwashing is a more appropriate term than mental disease. The good news is that brainwashing can be overcome."

General news and election content can be posted if they wanted. They can lock the commenting so they don't have to mod. It's still more than nothing getting posted.

I can't imagine it would be too hard to moderate such a limited number of daily threads, especially with the current traffic so low. And with the remainder of us here and ready to smash the deport button on trolls, you're getting plenty of assistance.

I am so disappointed in this direction. When half the mods were sacked, you guys should of went right away with contacting old temp and perma mods and seeing if they could help.

Myself, I didn't have the time to say mod a thousand posts a day, no way, but we could of helped. There were many former mods who were here at the beginning that would of helped out of respect for what this place did for Trump.

Shutting this place down should have never been an option.

I've had my disagreements in the past with a few of the older mods when I was a mod and thats why I haven't been around, but it should have NEVER come down to shutting this place down since this place is one of the MAIN reasons Trump got elected in the first place.

Where have all of the idea people that this place had a couple years ago gone to?

.WIN was in place at the time which was a good option if we were shut down, but to say that you are going to devote all your time to that place is a mistake.

Like it or not as I said, Reddit reaches far more people, especially new voters than promoting an alternative option. They didn't want to promote the new website at the time, in which I calshed with them with, bc it wasn't done.

Fine. but promote it, let people know it's coming.

It's a little too late for that. You prmoted it then and you would of been getting the traffic this sub has gotten. 

Another thing is look at the AMA's. We used to have them monthly, if sometimes not weekley. What happened?

Why were some of the best mods let go? I know for a fact some were forced out.

11943,"&gt;*we've decided that none of the applicants are qualified at this time*

Last Tuesday, you provided an [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/fcmty3/an_update_to_the_ongoing_situation/) informing T_D users that you were initiating an ""extreme vetting"" process for the 36 'Reddit approved' mods which [you said would take ""several weeks"" to complete](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/fcmty3/an_update_to_the_ongoing_situation/fjdg38q/?context=3). 

Many viewed your update with suspicion due to the use of weasel words which suggested a lack of urgency. I was optimistic that your carefully crafted words were an effort to appease Reddit and buy time to determine next steps. Others commented it was a smoke screen to keep T_D shut down so you could drive more members to the .win site. The conspiracy theories are understandable considering the lack of transparency. We haven't heard a whisper from the mods for seven days while the traffic here has reduced to a trickle. Were it not for Tom Fitton, T_D might be dead already. 

So now you are starting the process over again with another weasel worded update suggesting an even longer delay before anyone can post here at T_D.  

&gt;*After you complete your tour, you are welcome to either re-apply for another tour, or you could even be selected to become a permanent mod!*

What you and the other mods need to understand is that distrust in the current remaining active mods is growing at T_D. There are many users, including myself, who supported the .win site as a 'doomsday' alternative but who now recognize there is no urgency to reopen T_D to posts. This narrative threatens to undermine the growth of TheDonald.win site. At a minimum, you and the other mods should provide greater transparency on your schedule and progress. 

If our mission is to re-elect President Trump in November, we need both T_D and the .win site. Keeping T_D will ensure that original T_D content and memes can be mined and re-distributed by the 750k + members who joined T_D before the quarantine. The .win site can continue to improve and grow while also serving as a forum to report efforts by Reddit to censor, suppress or infect this sub with anti-Trump redditors and bots. Keeping both during the campaign season is a win-win for MAGA. Abandoning this sub of 750k pedes, the majority of who only lurk here for exclusive pro-Trump content, is a legacy that will taint our movement. Please don't let that happen."

11945,"Been on Reddit almost a decade. Every year I spend here I get more disappointed by it. Fuck the admins, fuck the CEO, you guys are sellouts. You've ruined a fantastic site"

11954,"I'm disappointed in this subreddit. I've been a part of this since the beginning, and I've never known it to roll over and die for the sake of some website push.

I get that no one was moving to the .win site, so you had to take desperate measures, but c'mon. We have all these energized Patriots who turned a nothing sub into the most active community on Reddit, and no one wants to take that energy and turn it into something positive or useful? We could have stormed any of the subs we talked trash about: redacted, politics, etc. We could have gone in there 700k deep and shifted the narrative completely! Instead, we get this push to a barely functioning website and a discord. 

High energy isnt just shitposting in a safe space. It's about getting out of our comfort zones and making a real, lasting difference. 

This is weak sauce, ladies and gentlemen. I am truly disappointed."
11955,"Reddit wanted us gone! They forced Snap out and I want to say the person before her. We knew at the time Reddit was hiding the numbers of actual subscribers to the sub. They threaten to sht us down several times, they shadowbanned tp posters like me and a few others to keep us off of r/All. And when that didn't work, they finally they just rewrote the algorithm to keep us off of r/All all together.

We were talking about .WIN back then, I wasn't developing the site nor knew the progress because I was focused on this sub and didn't ask, but I argued it should of been promoted.

Even is.Win became a new base, it's not getting the traffic as TD did. We should of gone out guns blazing. Even though I haven't been apart of this site for 2 plus years, I hate to see it come to this. I have been getting reports that the mods have no interest in reddit and want to promote the new site. I still am in contact with many former TD mods, and new ones.

Yes, there are boards about things, but people are here cause, well, people are here. As it degenerates more and more into a far left echo chamber for non neurotypical lunatics, normies leave. And ironically enough, the non neurotypical lunatics leave again in short order. Their whole existence is based on telling people what to do. They loathe each other no less than everyone else does."

12071,"Admins, I was REPEATEDLY doxxed by a moderator from the XXChromosome subreddit because I came out against abortion. Nobody took action."
12072,"In defence: 

Social acceptance only gets you so far. I'm gay, it's no longer a big deal, but it was a big deal and I'm old enough to have lived through that. Your experiences, especially the negative ones, leave a mark and colour your thinking. There have been occasions where I've obsessed over the question of ""Did they treat me like that because I'm gay?"", my point being that it gives you a permanent point of doubt and vulnerability in your thinking. I'd imagine that being trans is a million times worse than that. Stack up enough weaknesses and stresses and some people become suicidal as a result.

In agreement:

Gender dysphoria is a symptom of many mental illnesses, not just legitimate transgenderism (I do believe it exists, but the incidence is microscopic. The number of people that transition successfully and are able to live normal lives, which is a large part of my benchmark for whether someone can be argued as trans or not, is microscopic). There is an enormous amount of misdiagnosis and mistaken treatment in this realm, and even without comorbidity of mental illness (which is enormous in this cohort) that would be enough to raise the suicide statistics to unacceptable levels. You cannot just flip from one gender to another and expect that to not be insanely stressful. That would be enough to break plenty of perfectly healthy people, so we can hardly be surprised when it breaks people that aren't psychiatrically healthy to begin with.

My take:

Regardless of what transgender/gender dysphoria is or isn't, these people are still people, and a vulnerable population at that (and when you throw in minors it gets even more so). We need to figure out a better way to deal with the situation, and them as people, because the outcomes at present are beyond unacceptable. When you've got levels of suicide (and that's only the tip of the iceberg, people with gender dysphoria have worse outcomes on every single metric we can measure) this high it is a crisis. What we are doing right now is objectively a failure that kills people by suicide and makes most of the rest no better off.

We need to come up with ways where the individuals in question can live in society and cope with being as they are today (as with any incurable mental illness). If irreversible transition is appropriate after that for some of them then fine, but it needs to be something that is done with a clear head. If this is a condition that cannot be cured then it must be tolerated, both by society and the individuals with it. When people are committing suicide you have to be able to show them that they don't have to do that, and frankly, if we look at the state of their lives it's hard to be able to argue that with them. Can you imagine what it must be like to be like that, stuck living that life? That's what we need to fix, and they can't be expected to do that on their own and without our support."
12073,"The unjust actions, by Reddit towards this sub, are ultimately a vested interference towards the upcoming election. Is it election meddling in the legal sense? Most likely not. Even if it is proven that the Chinese bought out part of Reddit to silence opinions. 

It IS for CERTAIN an attempt to stifle common discourse.  We all knew the Democrats wanted this long, long ago. Kids can‚Äôt sit ‚ÄúIndian style‚Äù, historical statues are no longer, gender dysphorics are‚Äôt supposed to seek mental help but physical transition, abortion is a ‚ÄúRIGHT OF WOMEN‚Äù not a medical procedure causing trauma or other mental health issues, illegal citizens are now ‚Äúundocumented immigrants‚Äù.... this war and quarantine is about silencing your opinion, and will never be a legal battle... it‚Äôll be a moral one. Stand up for what you believe in, as often as you can, because our own moral principals are being silenced."

They are actually the cool kind of trans person, who knows that they are still a guy and don't expect you to think otherwise, they just changed how they live for their own mental health and self-image and don't require us to believe that reality has magically warped around them.

And the issue here isn't even regarding TDS, its just the most visible sign of the disease. Every sub, of most any interest, is a minefield where deviation from a strict opinion imposed by the mods, in any way, gets you removed.

Even anti identity politics ones.

I lean left and I hate it. This place was one of the few where actual discourse was still even possible.

Most places are modded by the same fragile cabal of powermods who, well, authoritarian is putting it mildly.

To see just how much even the left detests the current situation, look at the result of the primary. Bernie lost simply due to wokeness. I lean left and simply put I will NOT in any way, shape or form, risk any of these fucks ever attaining (more) power."

This is you.  If it's not going to be enforced, then why does it need to be a law?  Why did they feel the need to ""clarify the guidelines""?

The answer, that you know and everyone paying attention knows, is that it will be *selectively* enforced against people the politicians in power don't like.

But no, that's totally cool, it's fine, we don't need to worry about that at all. Obviously you don't, because you're not conservative and don't have to worry about being censored or silenced just for living in reality, but for those of us who sit at our desks knowing we'll be passed up for promotion if anyone finds out we actually like borders and think 10 year olds having money stuffed in their waistbands by horny adults is not the direction we should be going, selectively enforced laws matter a whole hell of a lot.

&gt; - Be in good standing with our Safety team (e.g. no account suspensions in past year)
&gt; - Have at least 1000 total karma
&gt; - Have at least 500 karma in the_donald
&gt; - Not have more than 500 karma in quarantined subreddits (aside from the_donald) or subreddits banned for rule violations (not including communities banned for being unmodded)
&gt; - Have at least 1 month experience moderating a subreddit in good standing
Not be an alt of any ineligible accounts

How is this not a deal breaker?"
12298,"Do you think this isn't going to come and bite you in the ass or are you intentionally trying to see how far you can push things before they ban the sub?

I mean being the official unofficial sub for Trump does mean they can't ban you for rule breaking as easily as everyone else but still, why are you tempting fate? Or do you legitimately think you're untouchable?"
12299,Those were good times.
12300,Why is this even relevant here?
12301,"They can go fuck themselves if they think that gestapo bullshit will have any sway in how I vote or act.

Fuck them with a split cactus, sideways."
12302,Really need more diversity. Where are my shadows of color homies at?
12303,"south park style animation:

`Jeopardy category, Moderators for 500`

`People who admin reddit:   F_GGOTS`

`You have 10 seconds, Stan.`"
12304,"Do mods get a mass upvote button?

That would be my only reason."
12305,"Ironically, this post could get you banned"
12306,"Okie dokie. I guess there‚Äôs no other politician in a position of great power like that elsewhere who womanizes, puts people down for no reason, is friends with child molesters, or any of that. Guess everything‚Äôs fine then."
12307,"How are you posting if you are banned?

&gt;Every community everywhere had it's culture and guidelines.

I do see why people would think you are a troll, or a shill though.

Look around, do you see this situation being okay? Do you realize that the ""culture and guidelines"" are imposed from the top down and have to agree with a given agenda?

Look at the reqs for new mods for instance.

And that's the issue, mind you. The culture and guidelines as you'd call them, come from (usually) a cabal of non neurotypical lunatics *regardless* of the wishes of the people in the actual sub. Take a look at all the corona subs for an example, a few days ago, Reddit went and set the mods it wished in there and they all are now moderated by the same people.

The ones that sprouted organically from people who wanted to exchange info, and you know, actually discuss things? They are quarantined.

Honestly, I haven't checked either of those boxing subs, and if they are fine, great!

But most places? They aren't fine, and this culture of thinking posters and content are playthings for mods/admin, is beyond pervasive.

Mind you, I'm not saying this place was perfect, but hell, I lean left and nobody has ever fucked with me, despite making it clear that I'm a poc, I date white girls, I'm pro choice, etc. Hell, I've had a few good arguments on the subject of any of those things.

Oh, I'm an immigrant too!

Left leaning sites? I can't go 5 words without someone ""as a black man'ing"" me, or some such idiocy, or pointing that I've posted, well, here, or similar. Its all purity tests all the time, all ad hominem all the time and its... beyond exhausting.

Hell, I was declared Russian for both not caring about Captain Marvel, and The Last Jedi and thinking they were shit. Imagine that.

Even now, I wonder what happens if the topic of whether transfemales should fight cis females comes up in any of those kickboxing subs (just off the top of my head).

Cheers, regardless, just sharing my opinion."

12311,context? lol
12312,I wish I could be a Shill Mod but I have no moderating experience.
12313,Because that isn't the real reason for the downtime. I created a post song for transparency around that whole situation and I was banned
12314,The reason we can't use both is because the mods locked us out of here
12315,"Tom, you're shadow banned. You're not showing up in the_donald anymore. I had to navigate to your account to find this"
12316,I want to comment on T_D all the time to mock them but always stop myself because I am afraid of even having the fact that I posted there be on my PERMANENT RECORD which is unfortunate.
12317,You know it's bad when they won't even let you post.
12318,"They need to mine it for actual content. They didnt start using snowflake for nothing, those pussies!

12320,the TD mods restricted posting themselves and encouraged everyone to leave reddit and go to WIN
12321,it would be banned for quarantine evasion
12322,Hi shill. Fuck off
12323,so tired of mod drama.  this site has become one big crybaby fest about reddit instead of focusing on our president.  appoint new mods and open up the site.
12324,Bernie Sanders will never be president sweety :)
12325,I didn‚Äôt vote for Bernie
12326,Nice well thought out argument. I assume that by ‚Äúshill‚Äù you mean something political. Guess it kinda kills your assumption when I say I‚Äôm not particularly political wouldn‚Äôt it. Shame.
12327,Look they're not hiding the upvote counts anymore. Fucking loser cucks.
12328,"Yes, that‚Äôs correct. But your claim was still factually wrong, as I explained above."
12329,"I does, but it also makes sense that someone with little political sense would hold onto the corporate media narrative about said person without any real evidence, despite a mountain of contradictory evidence they're too politically lazy to look through."
12330,Time to shut it down.
12331,"I'd probably apply if I met the qualifications. I could spend some time every day doing it, but alas... never been on Mod on Reddit."
12332,I've browsed TD every day for almost 2 years and I don't think I have retained more than maybe 3 user names lol how people do that is a shock to me.
12333,r slash trump
12334,Weren't they? Remember when the SJW crowd got made fun of constantly?
12335,"&gt; We were gonna go out swinging no matter what.

We should have burned this place to the ground after she got banned.  Ever since all we've heard is how ""next time, we're going to stick it to reddit - but not right now""

12336,"### üéµ it's the end of the world as we know it, and i feel fineüéµ"
12337,Should have stayed that way.
12338,"People moan about thedonald.win being giving up, but the ban IS coming. Like it or not. We need a place to recongregate. As for it being a circle jerk, if people weren‚Äôt taking the content from here and sharing it outside these hallowed halls, they were T_Ding wrong. In the mean time, we will keep on doing what we can to walk the line between meeting the unreasonable demands of admins and staying true to our identity."
12339,"Basically, you have to be active on Reddit OUTSIDE of T_D, which the patriots among us generally aren‚Äôt because we know the rest of Reddit is an anti-American wasteland."

12343,"Approving of HRC testifying is against TOC, it seems."
12344,"Seriously, this is the first time I have used this account in almost two years. I learned a lot when I was a mod here and I believe expanded on  some of that knowledge. When I joined another Trump related forum afterwards, I was able to pull in some big AMA's and connect myself with some recognizable names. My Twitter account that I was using was banned over a year ago so outside of a few phone numbers I have, I would have to start over again. But I have some ideas. Again though, these mods never asked for help nor advice."
12345,"You're new here, and the party on L√© Reddit is near over.

&gt;If we started working Saturdays, we‚Äôd have an extra two months of vacation in a year

Says the actual idiot."
12346,"It‚Äôs not your posts that would be an issue. It‚Äôs their inability to effectively moderate the comments left by the shills invading us when they are crippled (half of mods gone and bots removed). If we get out of this (unlikely), then you‚Äôll have it back. If not, there‚Äôs thedonald.win, a less ideal but not cucked option."
12347,Try reading some of the most recent non-Fitton posts. It‚Äôs spelled out clearly.
12348,"Just what this sub needs 


An application to be doxxed"
12349,Not yet. No doubt they‚Äôre looking for ways to do it though. Showing activity there will improve our chances of getting one!
12350,"I don't see why not. If they weren't banned by reddit in the last year nor have any suspensions, I think it's fair game. If not, advice was still always allowed and also, many of us went onto other subs or knew other people who could of done the job that we could trust to carry on what TD was founded on."
12351,Did someone say caterpillar?
12352,Thanks alot for all your efforts.
12353,"Thank you and at least I know I tried. Well, I will check back in on this account every so often, hell...... maybe even start my own forum which would be founded on what TD was supposed to be founded upon. I'll check in on some of the original mods of TD and see where they are at and if they wanna give it a go or not. We'll see though cause I can't do it on my own. I am far too busy."
12354,What rules did the posts break?
12355,People don't realize the impact oil has on the market.
12356,Thanks.  I'm already there.  I hope it rises to the same energy level as this site once had.

12365,Hey admins. It‚Äôs a website. Fuck off and quit making rules you know no one can follows. Fuckers
12366,Until the lock this post out too
12367,"Fitton just left a comment that he's not allowed to post here now. lmao. The only other approved submitter in a dead sub. Didn't explain why but hopes it's only temporary. Makes you wonder if it's orchestrated mod drama or reddit. Who knows, who cares. Sub went from all intents and purposes dead to just dead."
12368,"The primaries are in full fuckin swing and a global pandemic was just declared, whether it's overblown or not, it was declared. Open the fuckin sub. People count on this place for fuckin news, you selfish pricks."

12372,"Reddit used to be great about ten years ago, but the admins ran it into the ground.  Moving to SanFran was a major turning point - forcing your employees to be surrounded by human shit and heroin needles every day probably makes them grumpy."

12379,"That's against Reddit policy (avoiding quarantines) and will likely get this sub banned permanently. Until more users migrate over to Win, we can't really afford that."
12380,I'm afraid so. The win is running really slow. Came here to see if its any better.
12381,Sad.
12382,"It does not even need to be fair. Trump is going to ass fuck whoever they nominate.

Going to be a good old fashioned ass kicking and they already know it."
12383,"The biggest problem I have with what you said is that it's a crisis. Comments like that greatly skew the readers perspective on just how few humans we're talking about. This is a tiny percentage of the human race. It doesn't negate their problems, but the absurdity is that society has been changed in vastly impactful ways for this tiny group of people. More people are killed by violent crimes or drugs in a week than die from trans-related suicides in a year. Why is this even a common discussion?"

12397,"Once again, the requirement to have been a moderator is the arrow in the knee. The amount of subs with open mod positions and that on top of that would take someone with over 500 TD karma as a mod is slim to none. A good number of us intelligent, dedicated pedes are not eligible for this tour.

I think this is proof of corruption, not just reddit, but the mod staff as well. There's plenty of stickies in the past  two months which are obviously attempts at getting this dom banned.

Drop the 1 month requirement and you prove you're willing to have real pedes as mods"

12405,"No. It's just not an active forum. iMO, it wasn't mature enough to be the sole site yet. Not only because it still needed links ironed out, but also because it wasn't being organically adopted. You can't force things like this"

They see and hear POTUS, they like wha the has done and they will all be voting for him. So, yeah try and shut us down, try and still our voices. We will continue to win, we will continue to do what is right we will continue to be on the right side of history and you losers will be crying in your mammas basement."

12434,"We don't have to drop everything just for this group. All I'm saying is that what we are doing has low success, and that we can do better. 

I would argue that trans elevation is a product of political elements of our society. Trans people (and those with gender dysphoria more broadly) may be a small group, but those using them for political ends are not a small group. The prevalence of trans activism (and other aligned activism) is a symptom of a larger ideological conflict in society.

In the real world trans issues are not a common discussion. The internet itself has a huge skewing effect and a lot of people that are plugged in don't notice that."

But there are already far too many among the internet that serves this need, and if you're talking about the full-fledged leftists that cheers murder attempts to POTUS and sides with Iran, NK and Saudi Arabia or Xi crackdowns as and when convenient, they don't even have that much money to be a good target of advertisers......

We'd taken so much shit - over such a long period of time - it's hard to recognize that.

The mods might've shut it down, but it was a mercy-killing anyway.  Reddit would've just replaced them with shill mods and twisted this place even further, until it started to actually suit *their* needs.  FUCK THAT.

The End."
12501,"Around official quarantine time the mods split into two camps: remain, and leave. Both camps can make a good argument for their decision. 

The remainers decided then that they would do their best to abide by decisions and policies from admins, no matter how offensive or absurd. This could be essential in giving Reddit enough rope to hang itself, we'll see.

One of the busiest subreddits on Reddit lost most of its mod team and with it, the ability to effectively moderate. The remainers are staying true to their word. The debate between stay and leave is not over, and ultimately we'll each decide for ourselves."
12502,How can liberals and progressives feel right about suppressing speech?   Didn‚Äôt the nazis do this?

it must be really painful to be such a loser that you have to harness the beauty of the free internet that you so vehemently defended with net neutrality in order to silence others as you claimed would be possible if ISPs weren't turned into your slaves  


socialism: ideas so good you have to muzzle any opposition to them

if your entire world view can only survive because you were able to get rid of Aaron and turn his platform in your ideal hellscape, in which ""we promise dissenters won't be sent to the gulag this time"" - ""it's democratic socialism this time"" - how can you even function day to day?  


everything you believe in is lies and needs everyone to fear for their job and social life to be implemented

&amp;#x200B;

it's lies because you can see how they treat mods in general, how they treat their workers, how they treat dissenters,these people want to have control of the world and run it just like the run reddit: dissenters are disappeared, wrong think can't be tolerated, face-crime can't be ignored  


I'm glad I was there when Nick Sandman was being lied about and I just happened to watch the video, I was there when politics was getting a bunch of soybois up in arms because of his face-crime and I pointed them to the whole video - I am glad he sued a bunch of you media losers and you had to cave

12521,"I agree, we can do better. They clearly need help because they're harming themselves, and in many cases abuse on others occurs which perpetuates the problem. 
I also agree they're used for political purposes. I think it's used as a tool for peer pressure, as nobody wants to be seen as hateful and it's easy for the MSM to label anything against groups as simply pure hate, as they see fit. Similarly with how they handle race."
12522,"Why would he post there when mods prevented him from posting here?

News flash: It's the remaining mods who put this restriction, *not* the admins.

This bullshit makes me even less likely to visit win. Edit: I actually just did, and over there they're celebrating ""1.48 million unique visitors"", as if it has the steam of this subreddit, but provide no proof. 

Meanwhile comment sections on their ""viral posts"" have nowhere near the comments of the posts here, and their ""viral posts"" have 700-1800 upvotes.

Contrasting to here, where we regularly had posts reaching 10K+ despite Reddit's fingers being stuck into our sub and meddling and fuzzing post numbers to make them look lower than they were, there is a clear and observable difference between words and reality at this point, and I'm getting tired of it.

Faking it does no one good. Trying to *force* us to go there isn't helping us, because I can actually live without jumping into politics every day. I came here because I was enthusiastic to see what was happening and interact with this community, and considering despite a total lockdown we have at this moment over 2000 people online, this sub still has the community."

12634,"Reddit removed the majority of the d staff a few weeks ago and initially weren‚Äôt letting the remainder choose replacements, sounds like that might have eased some, but with heavy restrictions.

12642,"so true

they shut it down right before this (totally not-engineered) crisis"
12643,I think they know that their BS makes our resolve towards voting for Trump firmer. What they are hoping for is no more Reddit posts and comments that are pro Trump: pure censorship. Truth scares them to death. They can't rebutt on a level playing field.
12644,"Seriously. Who cares what reddit admins want, they'll ban the sub no matter what we do, and a ban is more honorable than whatever the hell you call what's going on here right now. Open it back up and let reddit make their move."

12656,Over a million users in a very short time period can do that. Things are being upgraded as we go.
12657,And the mods. They've wilfully killed this subreddit.
12658,How?
12659,"Fuck you, Reddit commies."
12660,"You're right in that this site was fantastic for opening people's eyes.  That's why reddit quarantined us.  That's why our posts are forbidden on the front page, they fucked with our subscriber counts, and ultimately, edged out our mod team so they could replace them with cucks.  A stand *had* to be made.  Don't hate our mods for that, hate Spez &amp; company.

If you think for one second there's a way to ""fight"" for this place you're deluding yourself.  They're making this sub invisible piece by piece.

And hey, guess what?  I didn't just come here for the circle jerk (although it admittedly feels good).  I came here for news.  I came here for truth.  I came here to see what POTUS was up to, on a day-by-day, minute-by-minute basis.  Plus, there are many pedes who come here asking for advice on how to red-pill friends and family.  They need links.  Statistics.  Talking points.  **They got those things here**.  So even while circlejerking, it was constructive.

All those things in the last paragraph can (and are) happening on  [The Donald WIN](https://www.thedonald.win/) .  So I disagree with you on the 'no purpose' thing for sure."

The only thing America did first was get a man on the moon, something the Soviets chose not to do because of the danger and the value of human life."
12663,"Just chiming in, it's the same when any of us try and post in your spaces. Permaban and scrub. I'm not here to be mean, just saying. It's wild how much the ""sides"" stick together, eh?"
12664,Agreed.  Win is pretty good but the Dom is the Dom.
12665,Only libs have that right.  Which is very obvious by today‚Äôs Reddit standards.

12667,Yup. Everyone migrating is doing what reddit wants. I‚Äôm here til it burns down completely.
12668,"Yup. Well in a month or so of this they can‚Äôt complain about rule breaking content if there isn‚Äôt any. Then they will lift the quarantine, Right, Right?"
12669,"Perhaps you can devote a moment to rereading my comment?  I specifically said you're free to stay here but that I wasn't inclined to do so.  It appears that you've lain with leftist beasts so long that you've arisen with fleas:  I left reddit precisely because of people like you.  You're crude, boorish and uncivil toward those who are ostensibly on your side."

12675,lol I wish I could up vote you twice.
12676,"Fuck Reddit. I'm going to discourage a reasonable person from using Reddit, especially if you censor me. And I'm still going to tell the shill mods they can suck my great fatherland"
12677,"a lot of people from a lot of different parties were in support of it. For example, the people‚Äôs vote campaign had Anna Soubry (Change UK, previously conservative), Chuka Ammuna (Liberal Democrats), Caroline Lucas (Green), Jo Swinson (Liberal Democrats), Ross Altman (Conservative), Andrew Adonis (Labor), and many others. It wasn‚Äôt just people of one single party."
12678,open the sub already
12679,That's not very nice.
12680,I miss you too.  :(
12681,It will only ever be a generic second-rate T\_D.  It will never become what this place once was.
12682,Have even more fun sucking reddit's dick for table scraps.
12683,"Are there some other good ones? The mods shut this place down and have all but abandoned it and I don‚Äôt know, the new site just isn‚Äôt the same."
12684,"The mods in particular don‚Äôt care, they‚Äôre all about the new site, they‚Äôll monetize it eventually, which I suspect is their end game anyways. I won‚Äôt begrudge anyone for trying to make a buck, I love capitalism, but I don‚Äôt like how they locked the doors to T_D and then jumped ship. It‚Äôs worse than what the admins would‚Äôve done, they‚Äôd have just banned us, instead the mods have left us to stare at a rotting corpse."

12689,"K, bye."
12690,"Well, Reddit has demodded half the team, and broken the automoderator.

The current mod team can't moderate the false flagging community and the few idiot members that every political subreddit attracts, so, they were forced to shut down the posting, and restricted most responses.

How long until Reddit removes the quarantine now?  They cannot make a claim that the subreddit is now engaged in any sort of rulebreaking."
12691,I am only here to stand up in the canoe and piss in the water as the libtards swim by ;)
12692,"There's a difference.  T_D has an explicit rule that says ""Trump Supporters Only.""

If SandersForPresident has that I missed it.

Also, I was making sound arguments, not acting childish.

I've never reported anyone for trying to debate calmly."
12693,"HOLY SHIT!!!!

DIGG STILL EXISTS?!?"
12694,So standing up in my canoe pissing in the water as they swim by would prbly not make it?

12747,"because the previous mods who were unable to fix TD's rule breaking content are basically removed from being mods.   


now, the remaining mods are throwing a temper tantrum instead of working to fix this subs issues and are forcing users to migrate to an entirely different platform so the same rule-breaking behavior can continue, as its not rule breaking on their platform."

12886,FFS
12887,"FUCK CHINA, FUCK u/SPEZ, FUCK REDDIT"
12888,"Well take 2 seconds and look at my post history from 2+ months ago. You obviously don't know how to spot a shill. .win is soul-less at the moment compared to what t_d was, and it sucks on mobile. I don't care about the ""website"" I support, I care about the content and vibe"
12889,"We have our own website now.. and that's stupid uh, how?"
12890,Oh shut up you big fucking baby
12891,Lol üòÇ
12892,There was a live thread. Stop spreading misinformation. You're fake news.
12893,"Fucking lol, its soulless?"
12894,"Use the unofficial app while you wait for the official one. Don't bitch about it not being perfect or exactly the same as commie run reddit. The content is the same as before, minus the whining about being oppressed by authoritarian wannabe admins."

12897,"I just got my first. Hadnt been to the Donald in a day or two, hadnt been on reddit today, noticed it right after upvoting this thread, though its supposedly from 13 min before my upvote.

12902,Hey I just popped my commie Reddit overlord warning cherry too! Cheers my friend!
12903,"My point exactly, someone is going through our posts and comments manually and deciding what is inappropriate and sending that fake warning, it is just to inconsistent to be real."
12904,"Spez Steve Huffman is sucking Chinese cock, slurping every drop."
12905,"Cheers m8! Love how they don't cite the exact rule, or what violated it. It's literally like a cop trying to arrest/fine you for something and them not saying what it was you did. Complete bullshit."
12906,Why were downvoted. These liberal lefties are trying to change the narrative on this sub since it got shut down
12907,"My ban has come, hooray!"

12913,"soul less might be the bad expression, but 

we'd often get over 10K comments on T_D during rally threads, or during dems debates. This shit was glorious and funny af. 

you get a few hundreds on win. 

And the posts are IMO of worse quality, most often memes only, and not much actual informational posts, We'd get lot of those on T_D. I'd often search for breaking news here"
12914,"&gt;since we strive for impartiality, we will not tolerate biased decision-making

I think that means don't take sides on Bernie vs Biden. Of course anything pro Trump will be removed and the user banned *after* it's been downvoted 300+ times."
12915,"I'll try the app for sure, didn't even know there was one. 

The content is not the same, much less actual informational or news content."
12916,"Looks like Fitton was trying to keep it on life support, mostly just a breathing tube, but folks even complained about that."
12917,NOT TRUE. GO CRY IN POLITICS!
12918,"#THIS BOARD IS ALREADY FILLED WITH COMMENTS TALKING NEGATIVE OF .WIN AND ACTING FUNKY WITH DOWNVOTES.

THE NARRATIVE CONTROLLING HERE HAS BEGUN!"
12919,I hope Reddit loses millions because of their stunts and dies a horrible liberal death just like anything else in reality liberals touch.
12920,You were downvoted to zero for one word.
12921,And I just got a account warning for upvoting lmao
12922,"I agree with you on this. Reddit admitted in the past they're too afraid to outright ban it because of the backlash it would get. So they're doing this instead. 

Meanwhile, everyone is being pushed to the .win site. In the future, if reddit does decide to ban it outright, any backlash will be much smaller if there even is one. Makes you wonder if pushing everyone to another site isn't playing into reddit's hands."
12923,Me too! Fuck you spez!
12924,"&gt; You can not ""behave in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit"" 

So, you mean like threatening to suspend someone for upvoting something without telling them what that was?"
12925,"Plain in simple Reddit won‚Äôt let them choose actual mods, the limits are so strict from Reddit it‚Äôs probably next to impossible to find enough people who aren‚Äôt leftists and qualify, plus they got to make sure those applying aren‚Äôt trying to further sabotage, give interviews and check back ground. All this and deal with the increased flow to .win.  I wish they‚Äôd update us more here, but with what Reddit did to them I‚Äôd give them the benefit of a few more weeks."
12926,Those Commies need to warn themselves. I'm a reasonable person and they are making me not want to use reddit.
12927,"They hate that we aren‚Äôt crying, don‚Äôt they? All they want is for us to be as miserable as them."
12928,"That's actually how The_Donald was back in 16. There is a reason we won the meme war. We are getting back to our roots. The news is still there though. Admins are currently working on enabling a sort feature so you can have all news, or all Trump tweets, or all memes if that's what you want."
12929,The .win site is awful.
12930,I'm pretty sure we have completely broken 75% of their bases will to carry on. Only got a couple left to ridicule into the ground. Should have let us stay here in our echo chamber. Quarantines don't really work if you force everyone out.But you know lefty logic was at play and they thought it would be in their interest and it's only worked against them.
12931,Just got my warning about upvoting abusive content. Reported it for harassment. I feel privileged.
12932,This is some bullshit.. I want to see Wuhan memes
12933,No where else to post this but this is my 8th cake day.  I remember when reddit actually stood for free speech. :(
12934,"I just got mine too, just when I was starting to feel left out LOL"
12935,Funny thing is the only stuff i upvoted recently was from Tom
12936,Lol at the truth and all the downvotes you got for that comment.
12937,They setup a subreddit_drama sub full of shill posts to gloat about the Admin takeover bs going on with T_D.  The salt never ends with them.
12938,Im surprised we‚Äôve lasted this long... I mean Reddit isn‚Äôt even trying to hide their intentions here...
12939,It's time to open this back up and get on with MAGA business.

12946,"Finally got my first one. I noticed there is no mention of being banned for upvoting, didn‚Äôt there used to be?"
12947,Imagine calling someone a Nazi as you cheer on the fact they are being silenced. I can taste the delicious irony from here.
12948,I'm upvoting every comment in this thread.
12949,":D   It's true:

12950,No one
12951,‚ÄúNobody likes them‚Äù i.e. we‚Äôve grown too popular for Reddit so they have to silence us while retards like this cheer as their wife gets fucked by her bull in the next room
12952,You sure it's just not because .win isnt as good as here?
12953,"LOL. 700k subs here, 1.5 million unique visitors there. They posted the analytics proving that we were restricted here. In fact, you make such a good point I will be posting this on .win to relish in the new and #FREE, glorious karma."
12954,"Subs and unique visitors are different data sets.  That 1.5 wasn't a trend.  

Just my opinion, not a fan, and no conspiracy paid by reddit to come here and shit talk it, I'm simply not a fan of .win"
12955,It‚Äôs the same god damn thing. You are subverting the energy. Nice try you little shit.
12956,"Late to the party, but I just got my first wrongthink upvote award. Its an honor and I'd like to thank my fellow 'pedes, freedom, guns, and GEOTUS for this award. I'm going to shop it up as a certificate of award if anyone else wants the template when I'm done so you can frame it too!"
12957,"Lol, you're a dope.  You can visit a site and not subscribe.  Numbers not the same..."
12958,Okay stay around here where nothing is being posted you ‚Äúdope‚Äù.
12959,"Was just noting this.  Users on there stating they hope he gets it or hopes he has it.

Disgusting fucks."
12960,Isn‚Äôt this site ‚Äúowned‚Äù by China?
12961,And the mods here closed the Dom while the .win hacks ban everyone for the slightest infraction. We got played
12962,Rubbish site
12963,"Dude. I got banned for posting, then quickly removing the text everyone‚Äôs been getting today. The ‚Äútrump has corona‚Äù then when you click on it it‚Äôs a nude guy. Mods kept sending me tranny porn when I appealed. I literally deleted it after a few minutes up and hours before my ban. I‚Äôd been there since the beginning and all I got from mods was tranny porn."
12964,Woooooooow
12965,It sure is. I refuse.
12966,"It'll get banned, remember Mr_Trump?"
12967,"Mass deletion of Deddit is all we have left. 

People like Spez don‚Äôt give a shit about truth. It‚Äôs all about their ends justifying their means. 

They HATE POTUS and can‚Äôt stand anyone else that doesn‚Äôt think like them. 

Why the fuck stay on a platform like this? 

Fuck Reddit. It‚Äôs dead to me now."
12968,"I've been a long time bernie bro and I'm finally switching over to The Don, anything I should know?"
12969,"Wow this is how freedom dies, in America of all places."
12970,"Just got a warning for upvoting, but it doesn't give a link to the offending post so idk what it was. Reported it, because that's basically spam. Like a phone notification that wont go away

I come here and there is no posts newer than 17 days? what happened?"
12971,It‚Äôs a sh|t show.
12972,Ridiculous.
12973,"I also got an upvote warning message, what is this, the gestapo ?"
12974,"Same here, reddit = commies"
12975,Reddit didn‚Äôt Shut it down. The mods did* big difference
12976,Wow... This is something extremely wrong with this.
12977,it's fucking amazing.
12978,They're taking all suggestions and work pretty quick on them. I agree for shill spotting purposes
12979,lol taking cues from your leftist reddit over lords I see? Why not go all the way and add the Russian prefix
12980,it was always a back up meant for when spez got even more cucked. that time is now. Never thought the Donald would be the place where my Karma got spent. Definitely a different breed sticking around here. They can have speed's cock all to themselves now.
12981,The mods who were left.    Reddit admins basically strangled this sub to death.   Reddit admins are fascists.
12982,"If you need to stay on reddit:

r trump

r conservative

r donaldtrump

r donald_trump"
12983,"bots are gone :-( .    But here's a coat and a brick, making a zillion bricks in the wall!"
12984,Yea. The mods who were left chose to close the site and direct everyone to the .lose site. Tom Fitton was our only poster but they took his credentials away so now it‚Äôs completely dead here while .lose is a horrible site with juvenile mods
12985,I have to say... I don't really like the .win site either.   It's a disappointment.   I'm on the other trump subreddits.   Hoping the admins don't find an excuse to shut them down.   Basically any site that supports the President will be at risk of being shut down with some shitty reddit fascist admin excuse.
12986,We‚Äôre on the same side my guy.  I think you took my comment the wrong way
12987,Yup. It‚Äôs a very sad state of affairs. I‚Äôm on the others but it‚Äôs just not the same.
12988,"It really is too bad.   A relatively cohesive group has been splintered and scattered.   The admins have always wanted to diminish or eliminate the impact of Trump supporters and that's what's happening here.    I've been watching to see if any of the communities gathers some steam and it looks like r trump is getting some action.

I don't really care where but I miss that 24x7 rally."
12989,Is this place deserted now?!  Sorry but I'm not going anywhere.
12990,Are Fitton‚Äôs posts getting removed now?
12991,"What I'm gathering is that our illustrious mods threw a hissy fit and now it's either ""make a brand new account on .win or stay on this one post's comment section.""  ffs Well at least there's still James Woods until the idiotic CEO of Twitter bans him again."
12992,WTF happened to this subreddit?
12993,fitton can't post here any more?
12994,Has Spez come out as an Andrew Gillum escort yet? I know he loves gargling balls.
12995,What happened?  I don't understand how this forum went inactive??
12996,This is exactly how t_d started as well; I've been around the sub since the beginning and am seeing the exact same parallels...except .win is growing at a much faster pace.
12997,So do I
12998,Reddit killed this sub and is complicit in actual political hate speech.
12999,It took them about 14 days to run thru the first set of applicants so let's wait another 10 days to see what happens here.
13000,"There is a conspiracy that the people running .win are malicious towards the MAGA movement but who knows what to think. 

It does seem nice over there, but part of what made the Donald great was it was a refuge in a sea of left wing thought. Now .win is just a pro Trump website on it's own which feels different."
13001,Not holding out any hope at this point
13002,i think we all new the censorship was coming.
13003,Fuck reddit

13010,"U/spez is a gay commie. Like.... the gayest commie. Gayer than Andrew Gillum's poop and blood soaked, gay meth orgy. He's lost control of the narrative.

13029,"I think what you meant to say was, this post is already full of people shilling for Win. You know this is the only bandwidth we have, and you know everyone taking in oxygen knows about win already. Yet you're still he pushing it. You're actually blocking our ability to communicate and you're sliding responses. Thisbehavior encourages lurking shills to do the same thing. At what point to do man up and shut up about it?"
13030,"I'm on Win, and I'm still downvoting every one of you who are shilling here, because you've been asked to stop, you know you're only hurting others, and you still persist."

13033,"I'm American of Cuban descent, Reddit is making a huge mistake!
posted 10 minutes ago by wildqbn
Like many of you I received my Reddit warning yesterday afternoon. Of course, no specifics or reason, simply that I hit the up arrow on something they didn‚Äôt like. Reddit is making a huge error by marginalizing normies like me. I visited r/The_Donald because it was a great place to get a different view on all things political. I agree with u/Spez, Reddit has the power to sway elections, the proof being that warning me for wrong thinking just placed me in the Trump camp. I‚Äôm Cuban, I know the slippery slope of socialism, warning you that you committed a crime/infraction/rule violation without clear details is the red flag of totalitarianism. Imagine a cop pulling you over and giving you a warning, but refusing to tell you what you did wrong. That‚Äôs a RED FLAG and a warning to stay in your lane or face the consequences. BTW...this happens in socialist countries all the time. Cops pull you in, ask you a ton of questions about your personal life, then let you go (if you‚Äôre lucky) with a warning and no clue why they detained you in. The people who implemented this rule are those types of ideologues, ¬°free speech for me and none for you!"
13034,Some toilet paper would be nice.
13035,FITTON needs to move to WIN. Reddit is not for real pedes.

13043,banned comments:  yes and reddit got a massive influx of chinese funding. Meanwhile reddit is propaganda source #1 for the spread of anti american values and anti Trump rhetoric. Now China (huge investors in the site we are on) is attempting to again lie to the world. The veil is lifting day by day. Hope ya'll had fun being puppets of China. Who stands to win with anti American and Anti Russian rhetoric? China. Who lost with the tariffs that so clearly worked out great for us while the majority of reddit said they would be our downfall?

13061,Which of these is biggest/most active? I don‚Äôt feel like diving into r conservative if it‚Äôs full of never trumpers
13062,We on .win now.
13063,"Hmm, no legal weed (not even decriminalized), has no plans to extend health insurance coverage to over 60 million Americans uninsured or underinsured, doesn't believe in climate change (actively worsening our situation), no plan to combat the ridiculous cost of college or help the people that bought into the work hard, get paid ""American Dream"" (who needs educated people?), entire cabinet filled with the swamp, no plan to limit corporate influence on our elections... I could go on for days. Why in the fuck would I want to get on that train? Just because the media likes to freak out about every narcissistic and ignorant tweet? I'll pass.

EDIT: Just though of something else I wanted to say. The media demonizes Trump and Sanders for two entirely different reasons. Trump is an easy target and criticizing him just further divides red and blue, which allows them to keep profiting off of this corrupt system. Sanders legitimately challenges their power, so they are desperate to maintain the status quo."
13064,"I'm having a hard time understanding the hate thrown at .win and divisiveness of some President Trump supporters on the issue.

Reddit has totally fucked this sub up, no front page, changing posts, quarantine for bullshit reasons, eliminating great moderators, warnings for upvoting things the Admin's don't like with no explanation and no doubt in anticipation of banning users.

People on Reddit can't even find this sub and yet many are arguing that somehow we'll be influencing Reddit posters to vote for POTUS in the next election cycle.  

Reddit is doing all of this and more to come in order to censor us and marginalize our influence before the next election - likely banning us completely and without .win we'd have no back-up plan.

.WIN has improved dramatically from when it was first implemented, far more posters and functionality.  We can still post here on reddit, raise havoc at will and send people on the fence to .WIN.

It's time for us to come together in anticipation of the next election, not curse at each other."
13065,Got a warning. Don't care. I'll post as I deem fit.
13066,The win site isn't very active either. It's also an echo chamber hidden in the closet. Nobody but us really goes there and it moves us off-site where we might otherwise venture out into other subs and sling red pills. The Win site is a bandaid not a solution. Reddit is one of the most trafficked websites in the US... does it really seem like a good idea to move the rally from the sports field to your mom's basement?
13067,AMERICANS PAY FOR AMERICAN TARIFFS
13068,All good our economy gained against the Chinese by one simple trick that the ccp hates. Then the companies build some factories here in America closer to the consumers and bam it all starts making sense why China loves to fund the global warming agenda to keep manufacturing control. LOL CHI-NA if you're listening we don't need you and your economic manipulation for too much longer. Free Hong Kong Free Tibet Rise up and be free people all leftism leads to ccp like results.

Why are you acting like this is a bad thing?


&gt;	has no plans to extend health insurance coverage to over 60 million Americans uninsured or underinsured

Health insurance isn‚Äôt a human right



&gt;	doesn't believe in climate change (actively worsening our situation)

This is a gripe I have with Trump myself, but he‚Äôs not making it worse. The US has the lowest emissions in recent history and the US has one of the lowest in all of the world, so you‚Äôre just flat out lying.


&gt;	no plan to combat the ridiculous cost of college or help the people that bought into the work hard, get paid ""American Dream"" (who needs educated people?)

Agreed. 

&gt;	entire cabinet filled with the swamp, no plan to limit corporate influence on our elections.

Only a few cabinet members I‚Äôd classify as ‚Äúswamp‚Äù and I think an even bigger problem is illegals voting, dead people voting, duplicates, voter registration magically changing/disappearing, people‚Äôs votes coincidentally changes from repubs to democrat nominees. It‚Äôs bad and that‚Äôs why we need voter id laws and to actually enforce them"

13074,"&gt;Why are you acting like this is a bad thing?

Hmm maybe because possessing a drug doesn't make you a bad person, much less a criminal? I'm assuming you support prohibition of alcohol as well?

&gt;Health insurance isn‚Äôt a human right

I guess you can tell that to literally the entire rest of the developed world who has decided it is. I guess you know people that don't want healthcare, I certainly don't. Maybe we should privatize the fire department as well, get rid of the public school system as well.

&gt;This is a gripe I have with Trump myself, but he‚Äôs not making it worse.

You obviously don't care enough to look into all the stuff that he is doing to contribute to climate change. The Paris climate accord is just the tip of the iceberg. Do some research on this, I'm not gonna do it for you.

&gt;Only a few cabinet members I‚Äôd classify as ‚Äúswamp‚Äù

There's a lot more than a few, but how many do you need before you realize he played Trump voters for fools when he said he'd ""drain the swamp""?

Now I'm not coming to here to blow smoke up y'alls asses and say that you should vote for Biden. I'm saying that you should have higher standards for your candidates. No candidate is perfect, but your litmus test should be more than just ""I believe abortion is murder"" when 40% of the American people can't afford a $400 emergency. There's a lot of common ground to be had on these issues, but we're allowing these ranks politicians to have complete control of the policy and discourse."

13132,"Thank you for raising these critical issues.  

We all share disgust with Reddit's activities to censor The_Donald. This was not just the largest pro-Trump community on Reddit, it was Reddit's most active community. While the quarantine suppressed membership growth at T_D, it didn't dampen the enthusiasm or energy of this sub. Reddit's censorship didn't divide us - it united us. 

When the .win site was rolled out the emphasis was to encourage users to bookmark the site as a 'doomsday' switch. That made sense. It was good to know there was a site we could meet at if Reddit took down T_D. We also instinctively understood that Reddit would not take down T_D with the election season underway. Their CEO even said so in an interview with Breitbart.

I haven't seen hatred for the .win site here but it is evident that distrust is growing with the moderators who have all but abandoned T_D. Their lack of transparency combined with incessant efforts to promote the .win site has fueled conspiracy theories. I remain optimistic that they will reopen T_D but I'm not seeing any urgency.  If moderating the comments of T_D is so challenging due to a lack of moderators then they should allow posts but disable comments until there are enough moderators to fully reopen the site. 

My only criticism of your comment is that you underestimate the influence T_D maintained under the quarantine. Not only was viral content being mined at T_D and redistributed on Twitter, influential MAGA voices like Brad Parscale and Donald Trump Jr. were monitoring the site daily to learn which issues and messaging were resonating within the community.  I can't perform the searches tonight but I will return tomorrow and edit my comment to include links to their statements confirming their reliance on T_D for 'deplorable data'. 

If our mission is to re-elect President Trump in November, we need both T_D and the .win site. Keeping T_D will ensure that original T_D content and memes can be mined and re-distributed by the 750k + members who joined T_D before the quarantine. The .win site can continue to improve and grow while also serving as a forum to report efforts by Reddit to censor, suppress or infect this sub with anti-Trump redditors and bots. Keeping both during the campaign season is a win-win for MAGA. Abandoning this sub of 750k pedes, the majority of who only lurk here for exclusive pro-Trump content, is a legacy that will taint the .win site and our movement. We should not let that happen."
13133,fascists locking all threads
13134,"&gt; You can not ""behave in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit""

I'm just trying to imagine what that could even be. A reasonable person would evaluate what effect something has on them when considering what to do. Since this is the Internet and the effect a random person, whether they are a shitposter or not, can actually have on them is ""none whatsoever"", it stands to reason that the behavior of a random Reddit shitposter should have no impact whatsoever on the reasonable individual.

People who react to things which don't have any ability to affect them are, by definition, unreasonable people, and their behavior is therefore completely unpredictable, and there's no telling what might set them off and provoke them to open fire at any moment. That is why you should always wear body armor.

13250,"Regardless of what you guys think of reddit, you have to admit that the mods are contributing to this shit on your sub. Closing down this entire sub and pushing their own site as crazy, probably can't wait for that incoming ad revenue, all while pretending to make a new safe space for you trump supporters. 

Reddit did suggest mods, who the current mods found unacceptable for ""reasons"", so now they just went ahead and closed the entire sub so they can get more followers to their shitty site, all while pretending to be heroes of free speech etc. They're really making the most out of all this.

This is what I responded to. I'm know shilling for the donald but this site is dead. I dont really like the new site but fuck reddit and fuck the new shadow mods here. If you don't believe in Constitutional rights than you should fuck off over to /politics where you can circle jerk yourself"

Usually, discussions in the real world involve data, and not ""hurr, you're an idiot"" with no counterargument.

&gt;where you get 2% is beyond me

The... CDC?

The mortality rate is currently somewhere between 2-4%, and many sources have indicated it is likely inflated, because many people aren't going to the hospital to even become statistics. There are likely many orders of magnitude more cases of COVID-19 in various homes around the country, where people self-treat, and those are not factored into the numbers. The death rate is very likely much lower.

Perpetuating your misinformation is both irresponsible and disgusting when not even the most off-base, liberal sources on the Internet are talking about ""20%."""

13318,"They're warning that, uncontrolled, it could spread to 70% of the population. We could be like Italy in 2 weeks.

13319,a
13320,"Calling it a flu is an exaggeration.  Common colds are more dangerous.  

This is what collective mass hysteria perpetuated by a 24 hour news cycle desperate for clicks looks like.  Combine that with career politicians desperate to look like they care more than the next guy and you get the perfect storm of Coronapocalypse.

At the end of the day we will have crippled our economy to ‚Äúsave‚Äù the lives of 50 octogenarians that would have died in a week from some other virus anyways.

It‚Äôs fucking insane."
13321,"Yes, you and I will get COVID-19. But it simply will not impact us more than the regular flu, if you're a reasonably healthy individual. The data has said that only 0.2% of the deaths have been in healthy not-geriatric adults.

Do I have those relatives? Sure. But again, it's not worth halting the entire country over our small percentage of elderly relatives. Their time will be up soon anyway. We should not be decimating our GDP over keeping them around for another 6 months."
13322,Aha. I noticed the virus is mostly infecting and killing people in democrat strongholds. Have fun with that.
13323,"Upvoting this thread for obvious reasons.

Also probably getting warned/banned for obvious reasons."
13324,"See what I'm talking about?

In Italy the leading cause of death used to be cardiac arrest. Now it's the corona virus. Do you ever see the flu, or the common cold, lead that chart?"
13325,"You sound like a survival of the fittest, dog eat dog kinda guy. I prefer not to live like a dog :) 

Our GDP will recover, I promise. If you have any money, now is the time to buy stocks! Being mindful of those industries/corporations that may go under in the meantime."
13326,"A 1/4 of the country‚Äôs population is over 65 and during flu season the flu does become the leading cause of death.  Although in both cases it‚Äôs rarely the virus that causes death - in a vacuum it wouldn‚Äôt - but they are already old and sick and knocking on deaths door when they contract the flu/cold/carona/whatever.

Any more brain busters?"
13327,"I really like how you escaped the ""brain buster"" by inventing facts.

When does the common cold become the leading killer? You told me that it's more dangerous than the corona virus."
13328,Late to the show... we have veen quarantined for a while already. And also it was for bullshit reasons. For threatening cops... by accounts that are less than 1 month old..... lol.....  even tho we are the most pro cop subreddit.....
13329,"So it's run by the people who should be running it then? And you are a shill? Thanks for the clarification, lmao."
13330,Thedonald.win
13331,The dude who replied you seems like a stooge lol... as far as I can tell thedonald.win is for real. Use your best judgement of course.
13332,Advocating for commie takeover. You are the enemy.
13333,"I didn‚Äôt invent facts, sweetheart, these facts just happen to be devastating to your argument so - like a child - you plug your ear, shut your eyes, and say ‚Äúlalalalalalalala‚Äù until you get what you want.  Which, *bizarrely* is for rationale thinking people to arrive at the irrational and wholly unsupported conclusion that Coronavirus is some terrible killer.  It just isn‚Äôt -unless you‚Äôre old and/or almost dead already.  

Not only is the mortality rate for Coronavirus barely higher than the flu in most places - it‚Äôs also going to be ***WILDLY*** overestimated as there are untold millions of people that contracted it and made full recoveries - if they even experienced any symptoms - without ever being tested.

I know you want this to be a big deal.  I know it‚Äôs probably very exciting for you.  You probably have your cute little doomsday prep go-bag all set up and are endlessly jerking off to this fantasy of finally ‚Äúwinning‚Äù the game of life because everyone else whose smarter and wealthier and better looking than you died from a virus that YOU were smart enough to avoid because you had the incredible foresight to purchase 2 bags of antibacterial wipes and 3 extra rolls of toilet paper and hide them under the floorboards of your shitty apartment - but - it‚Äôs
Just not going to happen :(

No, unfortunately, a month from now, everyone will look back at this and wonder just what I‚Äôm the fuck we were thinking.  You - of course - will have moved on joinIng millions of others in the *new* fashionable trend of making fun of everyone that thought coronavirus was going to be a big deal.  Never admitting - even to yourself - that you were one of the idiots consuming and perpetuating this decades equivalent of Y2K.

Good luck.  God bless."
13334,"The whole ""threatening cops"" thing is something only a lefty could dream up. Conservatives are, by their nature, fundamentally pro law and order, and lefties are pro chaos. It's the most transparent smear they could come up with, and it never would occur to them why."

13338,From what i gather. The majority of legit maga mods were purged &amp; apparently some sort of half ass version of the donald still exists but only a select group can still post based on a communist socical score type of selection in order to keep the phonies who would do harm to the dom from shilling &amp; making threats. It's the commie way but I'm still gonna go and up vote for the remaining true Maga folks.
13339,This is fucking retarded let the users moderate.
13340,"Reddit admins are engaging in criminal election interference. They suspended my account for three days the last time I pointed this out in a comment because they are cunts.

13341,"OK, Creeper"
13342,"This person has no honor. Acts like a liberal crapping up our bandwidth and trying to force Win down our throats. Spends an awful lot of time here tormenting people. So, report the troll and then block. My feed is so much neater and tidier without him and the CNN Creeper!"
13343,"Well I've been on both for months. But they're not willing to engage in any discussion here to help us share information. They're just shilling win and doubling down. It's trolling, plain and simple. And at a time such as this in our country it's reprehensible. So I'm definitely rethinking win."

13345,Only a cuck would downvote links to THEDONALD.WIN!
13346,nu-unh
13347,Go to THEDONALD.WIN.... the energy is there!
13348,"I was one of the first couple thousand on .win and had been on t_d 4 years. It's absolutely sickening. I got a full permanent ban on .win for asking for transparency. Even the admins at Reddit only gave me a 7-Day ban and I said awful things to them. If the mods there were truly believers in a free market, they would let the people decide. Let the USERS decide. There is room for both. And if not, one of the two would die. I even asked if they'd be willing to do Trump tweets and live streams as a bare minimum. Nope! You go to their new site or you start from scratch! There are past t_d mods willing to moderate here, but the mods at .win demodded them before shutting this place down. I sent the admins a message asking to give it back to the old mods. Another thing about .win, I thought it was weird they blamed their outages a couple weeks ago on a host that kicked us for being Trump supporters, but wouldn't tell us the host. Why protect them if they did that? Or were there other reasons it was down? Regardless of all that, if they cared AT FUCKING ALL about the community, they'd o open this fucking place up, at a time such as this.."
13349,"I took note when you mentioned your ban before and it did raise a red flag. I'm getting bad vibes from this whole drama. Personally, as long as I get my news updates in a non-hostile environment, I'm fine. I'm more concerned about the quality of interactions than quantity. There are some small subs here that are fine, and some sites outside of Reddit. When this T_D is gone, I may lurk Win occasionally, but thats probably it."
13350,"There are several good subs here. Do I like Reddit leadership? Absolutely not, but I have interest outside of politics. I like that I can find information on damn near anything in one spot. I like seeing what other people in t_d are interested in. I like debating others and discussing ideas (political and otherwise). I was happy with browsing t_d/win probably 75/25. I would've supported both, but that isn't an option. I'm sure they probably expect me to create an alt and still browse, and I thought about it, but nah.... I just won't give em the clicks and/or data. I don't give a shit about the mod drama, I just want the sub back. Fuck this ""I'm taking my ball and going home bullshit"""
13351,The chicoms are rampant here now. Save that guys response. I hope he‚Äôs right but sadly I‚Äôm with you on this one.

13359,"After the original mods were purged, the remaining mods are trying to force everyone to the .win site by refusing to allow further comments or interesting posts. 

The mods even blocked TWFitton from posting, which was bullshit - it at least provided some content and conversation to justify the trip over here. 

Essentially the mods did the admins' work for them and saved Reddit Inc. from the attention and negative headlines they'd have suffered by  banning the subreddit.

To be fair, the USA - even though we are a democracy - also has some elements of government capitalism ( also called crony capitalism).  Our government is partially captured by Wall Street - the 2008 bailouts were proof of that."
13363,"Reddit admin was on here asking for mod applicants so that's legit.  Half the T_D mods were removed (banned?) and the rest don't have enough time to moderate here. So they limited  commenting to a couple of threads.

That is the only reliable info we have.

T_D mods rejected all the reddit admin applicants and then asked for people to apply themselves, which is what should have happened in the first place. 

Anyway T_D should be back up in about a week with fully vetted temp mods, pre vetted by T_D *FIRST*. 

I don't follow all the rumors. I got my win account not long after they first made it because it was supposed to be a fallback in case reddit banned T_D.

Iranian students have been coming here all along - thanks to the fact that Trump has not been able to get a complete Iran travel ban. They have brought lots of coronavirus into the USA.  Thanks Democrats !"

Totally 100% accurate. Trump was totally accurate. Here's what he said, quoting from your article :

‚ÄúThe Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. They‚Äôre politicizing it,‚Äù Trump said during the rally. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have any clue. They can‚Äôt even count their votes in Iowa. No, they can‚Äôt. They can‚Äôt count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, ‚ÄòMr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.‚Äô That did not work out too well. They could not do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. And this is their new hoax.‚Äù"
13487,"Hello admins, ban me."
13488,"What's sad is that you Democrats, especially Democrat judges, have been blocking Trump's travel restrictions in court since day one.

Apparently not, because you keep making up things about me.  Why?  Did you think I wouldn't know that I don't feel that way?

&gt; You also supported Obama

Obama sold us out to the insurance companies.  He didn't give us access to healthcare.  He gave us access to overpriced insurance with skyrocketing deductibles.  I'm not a big fan of his either, though he was a great public speaker and did a pretty good job of uniting people.

&gt; Chinese Flu

This is where it starts to get racist.  And Trump's response was to first pretend that it wasn't a problem.  Then lie and claim that it was completely under control and would be gone shortly.  Then lie and claim that there was nothing to worry about while the rest of the world started taking precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.  He also refused tests from the WHO, claiming that we had our own.  We don't, and most people simple can't get tested.  In our state, even those who do get tested won't be finding out their results any time soon because they don't have the necessary materials at the lab to process them.  Trump has bungled this from the very start.  He even attacked a reporter who politely asked him to say a few words to all the frightened people living in quarantine around the country - the easiest thing that any politician could be asked to do and he was incapable of even that.  There is absolutely nothing good that can be said about how he handled this situation.  To say that he's done 20 times better than Obama during the swine flu crisis is beyond belief.  It's absolutely delusional."

&gt; Closing the borders and banning travel to and from the effected hot spots was the right thing to do.

Absolutely.  It should have been done sooner, but the GOP was too busy telling Americans that this whole thing was nothing but a ""deep state conspiracy to make our president look bad"".  No joke.  They were actually saying that.  You know damn well they did.  It was all over FOX, too."

13558,Canada is a wealthy country and we don't have these millions of test kits you're describing when where are out million test kits? Put the blame where the blame deserves to be at China's feet. They have done nothing but lie about the severity of this virus since the beginning. They lied about the numbers and the severity and the silenced and imprisoned their medical community members members who tried to warn the rest of the world.

My take: 7 days is enough time to vet a half-dozen mods and more than enough time to post an update.

I'm glad you think mayors and governors have zero say in all this, in stuff like calling for people to shelter in place or shutting down schools and restaurants. The majority don't agree with you.

Let's take a small sample from western Europe right now, shall we? Not all of W. Europe, of course.

Spain 24,926 cases, population 46.46 mill

Germany 16,662 cases, population 82.79 mill

France 14,459 cases, population 67 mill

Switzerland 6,113 cases, population 8.57 mill

UK 5,018 cases, population 66.44 mill

Total 67,178 infected, population 271.26 million, roughly 83% of the US population and we have about 1/3 of that infected.

Notice I didn't include Italy, which is at least another 53,578 infected, and I only included a handful of western Europe

No, I think they had zero say in Trump's decision to shut down the pandemic response team that could have helped us prevent this disaster.  I also think they had zero say in Trump's decision to turn down the WHO's test kits, claiming that we don't need them.

Because knowing who needs to isolate themselves makes it easier to contain the virus, thus decreasing everyone else's need to isolate.

&gt; Do those test kits test for Covid-19?

Yes, of course they do.

&gt;  How were they able to make all those kits before it existed?

They didn't.  The coronavirus has been around a long time.  This is only a new variation.  It's the same virus as SARS.

&gt; As a matter of fact, di Blasio was telling New Yorkers to go about their lives normally. You can't blame that on Trump.

Sure I can.  Because Trump did it too.  Why do you think that pointing out someone else doing it negates what Trump did?  He's the President of the United States.  He's supposed to be a leader, and he hasn't been.

&gt; Are you staying indoors and not passing it around to the elderly? 

Yes.

&gt; I personally think the President should mandatory quarantine anyone between ages 15-45. That really will stop it in its tracks.

Testing everyone, finding out where the virus is, and just quarantining the infected would be more practical.  But, again, the president completely bungled this situation so we don't have tests for the general public."

Link please. It's related to SARS but it isn't the same.

""Laurie Garrett, the science journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for her reporting on the Ebola outbreak in 1995, said **China‚Äôs most-used tests have had false negatives nearly half the time**.""

https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/6/21168087/cdc-coronavirus-test-kits-covid-19

Continued:

""Here‚Äôs where the trouble started. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started sending out test kits to laboratories the first week of February, a month after China announced the outbreak. But the health agency quickly encountered a problem.

Some labs reported to the CDC that some of the test kits were delivering inconclusive results during verification. It‚Äôs believed that one of the chemicals used to conduct the test was not working properly and needed to be remanufactured.""

Maybe they were sending out kits to test for SARS? ;)

&gt; Because Trump did it too.

You just said it's a new variation of a cold virus. 

&gt;Why do you think that pointing out someone else doing it negates what Trump did?

Because half the cases are in NYC, which Trump has no control over. There are 50 states with 50 governors who can - and finally are - stepping up.

&gt;The coronavirus has been around a long time. This is only a new variation.

Huh? Like a cold? You're beginning to sound like the President you're criticizing.

&gt;It's the same virus as SARS

Link please. It's related to SARS but it isn't the same.

Vox article:

""Laurie Garrett, the science journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for her reporting on the Ebola outbreak in 1995, said China‚Äôs most-used tests have had false negatives nearly half the time.""

http://archive.is/fAIuR

Continued:

""**Here‚Äôs where the trouble started. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started sending out test kits to laboratories the first week of February**, a month after China announced the outbreak. But the health agency quickly encountered a problem.

Some labs reported to the CDC that **some of the test kits were delivering inconclusive results during verification. It‚Äôs believed that one of the chemicals used to conduct the test was not working properly and needed to be remanufactured**.""

Maybe they were sending out kits to test for SARS? ;)

&gt;Because Trump did it too.

You just said yourself it's a new variation of a cold virus.

&gt;Why do you think that pointing out someone else doing it negates what Trump did?

I'm not negating anything. Why are you trying to focus all the blame on Trump?

The fact is half the cases are in NYC, which Trump has no control over. There are 50 states with 50 governors who can - and finally are - stepping up.


&gt;Testing everyone

Easier said than done. But testing will only partially halt its spread, it doesn't cure it or vaccinate against it."

[Here you go.](https://qz.com/1820422/coronavirus-why-wont-who-use-the-name-sars-cov-2/)  It isn't the same.  It's a new variation. 

&gt; You just said yourself it's a new variation of a cold virus.

No, I said it's a new variation of SARS.

&gt; I'm not negating anything. Why are you trying to focus all the blame on Trump?

Because he's the man in charge and he has consistently bungled the job at every opportunity.  And for some reason, his cult members refuse to admit that he has ever made a mistake.  Even with all the video evidence of him downplaying the disease, he's trying to claim now that he thought it was a pandemic before anyone and his followers just seem to accept that new version of reality despite all evidence to the contrary."

13715,I got another warning yesterday. No idea what I upvoted that offended the ChiComm overlords. I also dgaf.
13716,Because reddit does what their chinese investors tell them too. They are treasonously spreading anti american sentiments during a pandemic. Why is the chinese embassy less than a qtr mile from reddit hq. Why is the chinese Visa department across the street from reddit hq. I think why the donald is gone all stems from the chinese troll farms controlling the information people are force fed.

13722,It's under the directive of China imo. They are fucking trying to bring USA down right now imo. Look at a friggin map of reddit's hq in relations to both the Chinese embassy and the Chinese Visa dept. Its fucking in between those buildings. Y'all heard about anybody finding any bats or retarded armidillos with covid19? They literally dont fucking exist. Like the entire media is going off an entire made the fuck up chinese lie about origins of a virus that dont fucking exist. Isnt bidens son working in china right now? Didn't his fucking botulism forehead father take him there too just like Ukraine?  this shit is fucking crazy y'all. The false song of globalism failed you didn't get our fucking guns and now you will never get our fucking guns easily haha. China isnt going to be able to come into my motherfucking country. U.N isnt coming into my motherfucking country. And I'd expect the same out of you guys. I dont want this to fall I fucking love the entirity the good and the bad. Its ours.

13724,I've been banned out of nearly every front page reddit. I've been banned out of my fucking state page. Just for mentioning reddit and china. It's so fucking obvious what is going on here. They got time to have 50k chinese constantly lying on here. And I really love the chinese members of my community it ain't about them. But all the chinese nationals that are in this country need to get kicked the fuck out like years ago. All our corporate leaders need to be given an ultimatum to get their manufacturing back home in the next 5 years or leave too. That's what I would do. And that wall is going up on the Canada side too lol.

The ol household budget is taking a hit lol. So I get my 50 lb sack of taters and I get a tiller from the hardware store and bam in the ground. Should return me like 250 lbs if I suck at gardening could produce upwards of 600 700 lbs if I'm pretty good at it. So ya cant let the wife and kids starve it would be unpleasant and I ain't got time for all that nagging and the complete failure to my ancestors for that. So I do what what any red blooded american would do got ammo and seeds along with 5000 rolls of toilet paper. Anyway long story short (the leftists claim that phrase as racism to the chinese hahahaha) I clean off that tiller after using as any true american would before returning god damn that shine looked great. Ya gotta respect a fine piece of machinery like that. So here I am after I took that tiller out my nasty ass gas guzzling big block ford dually all by myself cuz dont be asking for help like a bitch all the time. And I'm walking in that damn show room quality tiller and out comes a military aged and militarized body female Asian that didn't buy anything from basically the most useful type of store in America right now. She looks me in the eye slantedly and she runs to her vehicle. Cant shake it yall. What the fuck was that shit yall? Why would she be in shorts and t shirt in 35 degree weather going into a vital retail location and not doing any business as far as I can see. Well I'll tell yall but cant really say anything if you see suspicious things by certain types of people because then you're a nazi racist. Plant some food yall is the entire moral of that story.

Or can you?  Can you even acknowledge that telling me what I think was the wrong thing to do?  And how do I dispute someone whose does this sort of thing?  It shows a disconnect between your thinking and reality that no amount of arguing can change.  Your entire way of thinking is fundamentally flawed because you believe that you know my thoughts as well as if not better than I do, and your arguments are based on that.  But because you imagined it, you're essentially arguing against yourself.

13840,How drunk would a dude have to be to ever hit that?
13841,Weird how a Chinese-backed social media platform would block the most popular truth-seeking sub right before a pandemic. Cyber warfare

13843,"You aren't, but most of us are at .win due to Reddit Admin."
13844,"shoo, get off reddit and go to your off world colony."
13845,"Hmmmm, must mean something..."
13846,Get this patriot a coat!!
13847,"again,  nobody gives a rat fuck what some leftist shill has to say here.  nobody is here but you stupid fucking SJW NPCs...  

You don't have a clue what a Psychopath is...  not that anyone cares what a dumb fucking retard like you has to say anyway."
13848,"As an outsider looking in, something I don't understand:

Even if politically you believe in general conservative policies, how do you not watch Donald Trump speak for more than a minute without concluding he is the dumbest fucking person in the country?  I mean most of his former cabinet who have worked with him directly have been quoted as describing him as a ""fucking moron"" or ""idiot"" or ""stupid"""
13849,This just shows how confused you really are. People like you are the reason the DS is as strong as it is. You probably are waiting for McCain to vote against Obamacare.

Why don't you dumb bastards stand up your own platform or is that work you can't do? What about mastadon? That's a distributed p2p social media. Why can't you use that? Don't just sit here and cry you got censored....stand up your own thing you stupid dumb bastards. FFS the Daily Stormer has a site off an .onion link and it was a fucking Nazi newspaper and nobody can touch it censorship wise. God you pricks are dumb
13856,How is a relief bill socialist? Are you one of those people that think having police and fire rescue is socialist?

13859,"I applied (and think I should have been eligible), but heard nothing.

I guess this thread is the sub now. Feels like a life raft at the end of the world."
13860,The only confusion here is you thinking that anybody cares what a cuck thinks. You should get back to jerking off to pics of Michael Obama instead of starting arguments on two month old internet posts with lame fucking comments.
13861,"So you are looking at it in the wrong light. .win is not the distribution center for memes, it is the manufacturing center which ships it to the distributors (Trump Supporters/Us) we are the distribution centers which share these memes with friends, family, and those on the fence via other digital platforms.

Think of it like how big of a reach 4chan has despite relatively few people go their (relative to how powerful some of their campaigns have been). Their users weed out the shit ideas, memes, and idiots and picks out the absolute best that is present either trying to implement those ideas themselves or disseminate them on other platforms, sharing the memes which are their best, and promoting the idiots who make the best arguments. Is some of the stuff shared from there still trash absolutely but it also produces diamonds. 

.win needs to be that same kind of manufacturing area where the users disseminate the memes and ideas they think are best to those around them."
13862,".win isn't monetized for one.

also the mods shut it down because reddit tried to force mods into the mod team. Admin was basically trying to do the same thing to TD as this fungus [Ophiocordyceps unilateralis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis) does to ants. They wanted to take it over, feed off it for awhile, then when they are done with us ban us.

What the mods did is literally what ants do to protect the whole hive, Reddit is the fungus, and TD was the ant, so the mods took the ant and moved it far away from the community. While it might be a slightly disruptive route they chose they did it for the longterm health of the community."
13863,"Not completely alone but alas the sub is going to be in a coma until some lawsuit comes out against Reddit forcing them to respect political speech and free speech.

In the meantime .win is your best option for a healthy community of Trump supporters posting memes."
13864,Good Riddance Sandy Asiago Kotex!

13866,No but I read it on my kindle recently and it was gold
13867,Jesus what happened? I remember when they quarantined this place and then unsubbed it for me. I was filled with rage. Now I don't know what to feel
13868,I'm still breathin
13869,"the Chicom money makes up for it, though.  they're not losing anything, they just have a different customer."
13870,Sure would be nice for the mods to explain it like this. Why won't they post regular updates here?
13871,"Because most if not all of the experienced mods were removed. The moderators still here are likely the mods who mostly just spent time sorting through posts and either removing content or approving it after it was reported. Imagine you work on a team of 15 people and your boss suddenly guts the top 8 people leaving only the 7 people who did alot of the grunt work, but didn't communicate things to the bosses or people outside the team. That is where TD is right now. (Numbers are made up of course as I don't know the real numbers other than the mods have said about half the mods have been removed)"
13872,"MODS! What are you doing???????

Hundreds of thousands of Trump supporters who have poured endless hours of our lives here building a community are waiting for an update. Your neglect of this subreddit and failure to communicate are UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!"

13876,Reddit have successfully crippled this Sub. All of the action is at the TheDonald.win
13877,Nope

Edit: Also just noted your edit about the warning from admins. Weird.."

‚ÄúBREAKING NEWS: DONALD TRUMP RE-ELECTED IN LANDSLIDE VICTORY‚Äù she proclaims.

A few cheers are heard, and a lot of glances are shared. They weren‚Äôt surprised, this man brought the United States back from the brink of economic collapse, and now stocks were higher than ever. Unemployment was near-normal, and the dollar had lost only a step in its value. 

People resumed their nights in quiet chatter. They knew when the city vote was tallied, a vote not 4 years ago voted 86% for Hillary Clinton, had suddenly been won by Donald Trump that it was over.

13977,"Got shadow banned earlier... The mods don't like being called out. Here's the for post:

It's obvious to me that the mods are basically just leaving everyone with one option... To go to their site. There's no reason this subreddit couldn't be opened in at least a limited fashion. I really enjoyed T_D but I refuse to go to .win solely for the fact that the mods are forcing it. Idk why... My guess is to monetize the site when the election ramps up. Maybe to have total control? Probably for both reasons tbh. T_D was a great way to red pill the SJW's. The only people that will go the new site are people that are already Trump supporters. Honestly I'm surprised more people aren't calling out the mods on this. People are but not nearly as much I would have imagined with how obvious all of this is.

13994,"Reddit isn't the government, so you don't have freedom of speech here. You're thinking like a Democrat if you think non government organizations should be forced to cater to people's wants."
13995,"Mods left and boarded up the doors. Took their ball and went home. If they didnt get a fuck about reddit or the sub anymore, turn the keys over to other patriots to take over the mod job. If reddit shuts it down, so be it. At least go out fighting, not cucking out and then running away. Fucking pussies"
13996,Mods on here sold us out too. They coild easily let new mods take over but refused  and therefore locked the sub down. Bullshit
13997,"MSM is working overtime to cover up the incompetence of Cuomo, DeBlasio and NYC Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot. 
After Trump‚Äôs ban on flights from China, Barbot and DeBlasio went out of their way to tell New Yorkers to go to Chinatown for the Lunar New Year parade in February.  Barbot said there was NO RISK and that the city was WELL PREPARED in the event of an outbreak. 
These three should be in jail. Lawsuits incoming."
13998,This.  Dems were putting more effort into opposing travel and border restrictions than preparing for the virus.
13999,i miss this place :/
14000,Praise reddit
14001,How about you start being accountable? Lead by example.
14002,Have you stopped to consider no one is a fan of what your community does to reddit?
14003,"yes, you are the problem."
14004,"Well, america will end."
14005,I would like to extend that sentiment to this subreddit.
14006,"I find it funny how you guys complain about censorship, yet ban anyone who disagrees with you. It‚Äôs hypocritical."
14007,This is funny. r/The_donald mods do the exact same thing.
14008,Being transphobic just makes you and conservatives as a whole look bad.
14009,"This subreddit would be banned too, wouldn‚Äôt it? 

It censors anything even slightly criticizing Donald"
14010,I assume the pay is $0? No thanks.
14011,"The reddit admins forced the mods hands.  Blame them if you want, they had no choice."
14012,Still here... waiting... wtf?
14013,Totally....
14014,"Yeah but c‚Äômon man. There are toxic people everywhere including on the right. It goes both ways, because you can imagine being Asian American and being discriminated because our president calls COVID 19 ‚Äúthe Chinese disease‚Äù. Not saying that you are wrong about pointing out the biases, but it would also help if you didn‚Äôt call them commies y‚Äôknow. I‚Äôm a democrat (on most of the policies anyways) and that‚Äôs just not true eh"
14015,"Barr warns about hoarding supplies in warehouses; SEIU coughs up a warehouse full of masks. Somebody tell me, why does the SEIU have 39 million face masks?"
14016,Me too but I can‚Äôt post.
14017,Haha found this shitty ass place fuck this subreddit lol.
14018,"its already bad enough where if you have totally intelligent counter arguments to specific policies your not even allowed to talk about them on related subreddits.  


for example, ive experienced everything on /r/newyork from blatant denial of out-of-city demographics and opinions from upstate (including lies about the demographics and amount of conservatives outside the city who do NOT like cuomo or agree with the city)  


but also more serious things. like i tried to support trumps idea about a quarantine here with supporting information about heroin addiction and how its potentially exponentially spreading the disease due to heroin related travel/trade. but immediately, not one curse word -- nothing. just because it flagged an opinion counter to the dems (a positive word, and quarantine were probably set as flags) it didnt even set the automoderator to tell me anything.  


it just literally was not allowed. automatically. you cant even have a free discussion because if you use any counter talking points its banned immediately and nobody sees it, ONLY sanctioned opinions and false counter arguments are allowed. ONLY things that make them look good.  


there is no debate. no discussion. no freedom of speech. every subreddit is locked down tight. and if you do manage to somehow bypass the filters you will be demonized and dogpiled on immediately with nobody willing to offer a single logical counter argument"
14019,It‚Äôs over guys

14031,"whats so hard about following the rules? if you guys didn't break them on an hourly basis, you'd still have a sub"
14032,"that is exactly what they did, but you fucks support Trump so thinking isn't exactly your greatest strength.  They sold you out for their own financial gain, kind of the way republicans and Trump sold all of you out for their own political and financial gain.

Every time Trump goes golfing at his resort or stops the presidential Jet on his own property, we all pay for it and that includes you too.  We've put hundreds of millions in that guys own pocket and you fucks keep supporting him.  If Obama/Hillary did something similar, you'd go ape shit. If its your god emperor, he's owning the libs.  You really think Trumps gives a fuck about any of us, he'll kill your parents/grandparents if it means the stock market will go back up.

[TD.win](https://TD.win) is doing the exact same thing Trump did to you.  By moving over what little human traffic this sub has, they can exploit for money with ads and items to be sold like shirts/hats or w/e.  Keeping owning the libs, you don't realized you played yourself."

14041,First off I have zero evidence. But I believe that‚Äôs exactly what happened. There is no reason to leave theDonald locked if you‚Äôve abandoned it. Unlock it and let us use this ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù subreddit. Some of us are fine with that. I‚Äôm not going to .win anymore. It‚Äôs to clunky and hard to use.

14064,OPEN THE SUB! If spez and his chicom dicksucker admins want to boot everyone out of here let them. At least go down swinging!

Keep the American dream alive. Don't budge an inch unless you have to for personal safety. Look out for one another as all of us pedes do. Be safe. Have a great day.

14070,Basically. Mods killed it for their .win site.

IMO, this move shows that our mods are already compromised."
14078,"Not it's not. The .win is an echo chamber where everyone tucked tail and ran off to. 

I've had an account on .win since November and I don't see conversations there.. Just a lot of people who agree with each other and like to pat each other on the back."
