0,today‚Äôs the day we beat Sanders and his ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù
1,Joementum continues! This is how you build a winning coalition.
2,"If he flips Wisconsin, we win. Michigan and PA should flip back. Wisconsin is a toss up. That being said... I worry that Baldwin would be controversial unfortunately. Too many close minded people sadly."
3,"Bloomberg is out, as per MSNBC. Hopefully all of his money goes to Biden."
4,"I'm in for Sanders this primary, but I really don't have any huge issues with Joe's platform.  The amount of panic from the Bernie camp is pretty ridiculous.  Of course I'll vote blue in a general election.  What I do worry about is Biden's ability to carry swing states like mine, which are heavily pro-gun and have experienced job losses in manufacturing and agriculture.  We managed to get Scott Walker replaced and retain our senator in 2018, but that race was very tight and depended on youth turnout.  I hope you guys continue to hammer on the progressive message and wish you all the best."
5,"I felt so comforted when Joe moved closer, out of a fatherly instinct to be by her side. I wanted him to give her a hug, and then, in the back of my head I realized ""shit, maybe he can't do that anymore"".

While I'm glad he's responded to critiques about his touchiness... well, I'm even more glad he took Meghan's hand to console her. Joe Biden is a giant of a man in his politics and in his humanity. I'll be honest: I've personally taken a while to warm up to Joe as the nominee, but damn it, I'm ready. I can't wait for Joe to be the face America presents to the rest of the world. Let's fight hard to get him there."
6,He took the position because it was popular at the time. Or we can pretend a man went 70 years homophobic and conveniently decided ‚Äúnah let em get married‚Äù the second that a growing majority of people supported that idea in the lead in to an election
7,"Former Pete supporter who isn‚Äôt old enough to vote yet but will now work hard to make Joe the nominee! He wasn‚Äôt my first choice, but I‚Äôm confident he will be the best nominee to take on Trump and unify the country!"
8,"All the polls agree with Joe on this one.  

And the voters too.  Of all polled voters who said their top priority was beating Trump, 65% voted for Biden on Tuesday."
9,"Trump was busted soliciting it, it's going to be a non-issue and actually an issue against Trump."
10,"That's my point: Bernie's ""expectation"" is really an ""assumption,"" and it's an assumption not based in reality."
11,"No, he needs ideological and geographic balance"
12,"Yeah, M4A is definitely a wedge issue here. Personally, I don't like M4A because there are a lot of people (like myself) who are middle class but because of the specifics of how my benefits were done would make less after taxes and not get as much benefit under Sanders' plans.

In my case its because I am a government employee with my wages set by legislation. I would pay more in taxes than I do in premiums and the lack of deductible wouldn't make up for it. Certain union employees are the same way where they would have to spend a lot of time negotiating new wages to get back to where they are now after negotiating for years to get here (although I've talked to some union employees who do not have this).

That being said, what Biden says here (about wanting to make sure it doesn't have a high cost) and what he would do in the unlikely event moderate and progressive Democrats actually passed this legislation could be two very different things. The truth is there are Democrats in the Senate who are more Moderate than Biden so if any M4A plan has gotten through them would almost certainly be a plan Biden would approve."
13,also I'm guilty of this myself because I literally only just realized he had incorporated so much of Pete's gig worker plan when the campaigns combined
14,"Of course his supporters first instinct was to stay home and not vote. 

I think it matters how long Bernie waits to drop out. His supporters will hold false hope. 

I spoke to some Bernie supporters who thought Biden looked great in the debate."
15,Biden offers those Anti-Trump republicans someone who they can vote for without fear.
16,"Glad to see people here are reasonable and positive. While I'm a proud Bernie Bro, I'm glad to see others who are ready to join Team Biden are being received in such positive manner. Hope we'll all be one team again to fight the orange man...until then I'll enjoy the banter between us. 

\#ByeByeTrump"
17,"Here's my metaphor:

I've got a classic Lincoln Continental. It's an oldie, it needs some work, and yeah the emissions are a bit of a problem. Joe's going to fix whatever's broken, give it a tune-up, and we're looking at modernizing some of the safety features and the engine even if that means it won't keep all its classic parts.

Bernie's got a vehicle for me that is brand new, fuel efficient, great for the environment, and it'll barely cost me anything. But it's a bike. Dude, I'm not riding a bike everywhere, miss me with that shit."
18,Of course ‚¨ÜÔ∏èüôÇ
19,Aah thatd a good question. That would be a huge deal...
20,Did not know I‚Äôll take it down
21,"Very frustrating being an anti-gun liberal and Biden is focusing only on assault weapons when handguns cause the most deaths. But, restricting all semiauto weapons is pretty much a political impossibility :("
22,"I've been saying the same thing for months. Let's see:

Purity tests - check

Conspiracy theories - check

Intentional spreading of false information - check

Dunning-Kruger Syndrome - check

Cult-like devotion - check

Gaslighting - check

Confirmation bias - check

Did I miss anything?"
23,"And some of Mike‚Äôs, who know that Joe is now the clear alternative to Bernie."
24,"If democrats fight each other, it will help re-elect Trump."
25,It think there is a lot of cost manipulation and patent law violated among the drug companies.   You also have a saline drip (salt water basically) cost $700 at a hospital.
26,I was more concerned about the threat of physical violence in that video than the bad words.
27,"Thanks for that insight! That's how I viewed Warren, she was basically as progrssive as Bernie, but without the uncompromising populist approach. As a Pete supporter, her agenda still seemed a little bit too unwieldy to me, but I do appreciate that she tried make her policy proposals reflect the complexities of the world. I actually loved her anti-corruption plan more than anything any candidate proposed, but ultimately it was Medicare-for-all that made me choose Pete over Warren. I do hope she has a role in the next administration though, she is wicked smart, experienced, and brings much needed empathy. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Welcome to Team Biden/Pete/Amy/Beto/Warren! (Anybody got a better name?)."
28,"Yup, the logical choice is Biden. Do you think that's what got Trump elected in the first place? No that's not logic hombre. Be embarrassed to associate yourself with Americans, unchecked hedony can only get you so far."
29,"I like Yates, but she‚Äôs more suited as AG instead of playing politician. Also, reportedly, Jim Clyburn will have an influential say in the VEEP selection and he‚Äôs made it abundant that he would like to see a black woman as the running mate."
30,Maybe hes trying to push biden to the left. So his supporters would even be willing to entertain the idea of voting for biden. Since hes against almost everything i believe in.
31,I was added too. I've also learned you can block subreddits. Nice.
32,What‚Äôs DfD?
33,"I don't think there was any way a Republican could have won in 2008 after the disastrous Bush administration. The Democrats could have run almost anybody and won, but Obama certainly helped widen the margin. McCain knew he had to gamble for a slim chance of victory, but society ended up bearing the cost."
34,"Lol ‚Äúplease post a picture of yourself holding today‚Äôs newspaper‚Äù

But honestly, I hope he‚Äôs okay üëÄ"
35,I'm glad that the media seems to have learned from 2016.
36,A pro for Harris then being from CA..
37,Ah thanks!
38,"If the primaries so far are any indication, those people probably wouldn't have bothered to vote anyway."
39,"Pete fan here but Joe is my second, I‚Äôd be thrilled to throw my support behind him too. Huge win for him and hopefully he can consolidate support here and make a strong showing on Super Tuesday!"
40,"If these people are willing to let a coal lobbyist run the EPA and a pharma exec run Medicare just because they didn't get Bernie, then they never really shared Bernie's values in the first place."
41,[https://twitter.com/JTHVerhovek/status/1239700636108836866](https://twitter.com/JTHVerhovek/status/1239700636108836866)
42,"Pardon if this is too lengthy, but I feel the need to share:

I‚Äôm an Obama Democrat. I cast my first ever vote for him in 2012, and I love him and Joe. Kamala was my first choice. I was excited about her, I felt she had the tenacity it took to beat Trump. I was honestly displeased that Joe was running this time around because I felt his time had passed. I felt that he took away from some of the younger, more exciting candidates. After Kamala dropped, I switched over to Pete, but saw the writing on the wall.

Bottom line: I enthusiastically cast my ballot in NC for Joe last Tuesday because I know he can beat Trump. He has the backing of so many people I admire and most importantly, he has the backing of the backbone of this party: black voters. I am ecstatic to be on Team Joe and look forward to kicking Trump‚Äôs ass in November! Thanks for welcoming me with open arms.

This M A L A R K E Y will not stand, man!"
43,trump will do worse with all that kid touching footage.
44,Some of them (like rejecting NAFTA) certainly are.
45,"If Joe gets the nomination, I will."
46,I personally don't like how she so blatantly panders to women's issues. It's an obvious brand building exercise and it shows in the rest of her public persona too.
47,"Definitely agree. After Trump, I'm no longer looking for the most progressive candidate, but rather who can build the widest and most robust foundation for future presidents. The fact is, we're not ready electorally for GND, M4A, etc. as much as I'd like them. We literally just left Paris climate and don't even have a public option. We have a lot of work ahead..."
48,She deserves to be ignored.
49,Neoliberalism enables fascism
50,"I think I got the old version, hope they update it before it‚Äôs shipped!"
51,"""Tonight, Biden told donors a ‚Äúmajor‚Äù endorsement of him would be announced ‚Äúvery soon.‚Äù
"" 
 
 &gt;publisher: @jeneps"
52,Mike Bloomberg needs to put his ambitions aside and help us take this
53,Not necessarily. I actually thought it was going to be one of Pete‚Äôs best states. Not sure how it will end up now.
54,The best predictor of future behavior is to examine past behavior. This includes Bernard.
55,"This mentality is why HRC lost and was so divisive

*Basket of deplorables*

Biden welcomes all into his tent üá∫üá∏"
56,The VP will get picked for him.  You will start seeing more and more articles now that that race is close to being decided and a consensus will emerge. It will be obvious.  The good thing about Joe is that he can work with anyone.
57,"She won't because of these things.

1) Mass has a special election to replace Senators and they could elect a R for her seat. Remember Scott Brown

2) She couldn't win her state and Mass &amp; NE isn't in play anyways.

3) She billed herself as the ""Unity"" candidate but where is she when its time to unite?  

You can't claim Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy and then waffle."
58,"CNN headline earlier was ""Early exit polls show Biden in a crisis"" and I was in shock.

Then I reread it, ""Early exit polls show voters trust Biden in a crisis."""
59,like what?
60,"dirt is actually very relevant, youth not so much.  :)"
61,i‚Äôm a pete to biden supporter and this gave me flashbacks to all the hate he got... it really sucks
62,yeah Biden should get someone that appeals to young voters and progressives
63,"Both candidates are at real risk with COVID-19, hell, Bernie is even more-so since he‚Äôs running around congress with dipshit GOP that STILL refuse to take it seriously, plus Bernie‚Äôs recent heart attack (which increases risk of death from COVID-19)."
64,Now that Pete is out I am on the Biden train.  I don't believe Bernie can win enough of the non white vote.  We have to prevent another 2016 at all costs.
65,**WE CAN'T STOP GETTING** ***HIGHER AND HIGHER***
66,Bernie is not a traitor. Don‚Äôt go there
67,Yeah. All countries (left and right wing) are being pummeled economically because of this.
68,begone bernie bro
69,I'm not an addict! (Immediately refreshes page)
70,"Just because he wasn‚Äôt showing himself off every day doesn‚Äôt make him ‚ÄúAWOL‚Äù

Seems to me he was doing quite a lot behind the scenes ‚Äî meeting with campaign managers, talking with health officials, planning his next steps forward, etc. Just recently he said that they converted his rec room into a TV studio so he can make regular public addresses. We just didn‚Äôt see or hear literally everything he was doing, because he‚Äôs not concerned with constantly being in the news, but rather actually doing shit that gets results."
71,"Most Americans don't understand socialism tbh. There is an SRA I believe (Socialiasts Rifle Association), and Killer Mike is a member."
72,"Then why is OP complaining about the VP not being a woman? The VP should hold the same values as the president. The VP should not be a woman 'just because' or its their time. Or Black. or Asian. Or anything. If Biden can find a woman who holds his same ideals then GREAT, even better. VP is one person and cannot represent the majority of people. The VP is more public than the cabinet and is being used for identity politics."
73,I love the energy that has been here since the consolidation on monday
74,"I was more baffled about the democratic party thinking Joe Biden is the best candidate to beat trump and deliver all the things that you've said, such as being 'for the working people', 'increasing healthcare access, 'limiting carbon emissions, 'improving education' as an outsider, it seems like you're throwing away a massive opportunity not voting for Sanders? these all seem like things he wants to change radically for the better, and bring your country closer to the living standard of many European country's.. It honestly horrifies me the amount of medical bills you guys have to pay and the fact you don't have nationalised healthcare

We had the opportunity in the UK to elect a similar candidate as Sanders (Jeremy Corbyn) as our prime minister, but we fucked it all up thanks to brexit, brexit dominated the entire election and Boris Johnson's constant slogan of 'get brexit done' seemed to resonate with many voters who even normally wouldn't vote conservative, but because they voted for brexit they didn't care about any of the other important issues (such as the ones you mentioned the democratic party should stand for) and voted for Boris, who is a complete self-centered buffoon and doesn't give a flying shit about the British people..

You guys don't have anything like brexit looming over your election, it should be purely about the everyday issues the american people are facing, right? I cannot understand how people think Biden will do more for them than Sanders"
75,You definitely didn‚Äôt look into it.
76,"**If** Bernie were to drop out, would it then be an appropriate time to announce a VP? (Yes, I know it's not Pete since Joe announced it would be a female).  
  
I'm just slightly worried that without a VP pick, *should* anything happen to Joe, his delegates may not be united on who to switch to."
77,"Amazing!  Support Joe's campaign and rep your support!  Purchase official campaign merch from the official webstore, all made in USA from union labor and proceeds help fund the campaign!  Let's beat Trump!

 [https://store.joebiden.com/](https://store.joebiden.com/)"
78,Read the reply again
79,"Trump literally won against a moderate, with a much worse fanbase, that was not just ""mean"" and ""bullies"", but also racist and sexist. And he still won. And now you want to do the same. Vote for a moderate that will lose against Trump.

Anyone following this post's line of thought, PLEASE watch this video. https://youtu.be/BKDgE1rcEoA Progressives have a notable history if winning the general, and moderates, of losing it. We can't lose this opportunity to beat Trump because Bernie's supporters are mean. There's more at stake."
80,So do you think he personally supports gay marriage or do you think he's doing it bc it's good for him politically?
81,"Over on the right, click on community options. There was an assortment of flair in there. I'm on a laptop. I'm not sure if it's different on mobile."
82,Virginia is Biden Country!
83,Who???
84,Need to add Beto skating on the windshield and Amy manning a Stapler Turret on the back of the Car
85,sally yates should be AG imo
86,"For sure. That's most of what I think we'd be doing anyways, just in a group setting. Have you seen the other comment on this thread with someone else canvassing in your area? Perhaps you could PM them?

Even if you just do phone/text banking, you'd be surprised at the full impact of reaching out to someone who'd undecided."
87,"Oh, sorry. I was not on the ROTR team."
88,Avengers Assemble!
89,"I think the overwhelming general consensus is that Biden won the debate tonight. Coming from a former Bernie supporter who still has a lot of respect for him. The huge downside of his surrogates and supporters constantly spreading the ridiculous idea that Biden has dementia is that Bernie looks ridiculous when Biden outperforms him in a 1v1 debate. Bernie looked like a defeated candidate tonight, and his constantly falling back on his stump speech is a bad strategy that has failed over and over again. It doesn‚Äôt bring in any new voters at all. Biden does have previous votes
that are open to criticism, but voters have showed they don‚Äôt care about what happened 20-30 years ago. They want a leader who can unite the party and can get things done on day one, and Biden clearly showed he was the only one who can do that."
90,You guy are high hopes!
91,"Alright, there are plenty valid criticisms of Trump, but that one was so obviously overblown nonsense. It was so clear that he was saying ‚Äútheir rapists‚Äù not ‚Äúthey‚Äôre rapists.‚Äù Anyone who says otherwise was looking for reasons to hate him that they no longer have to make up."
92,"No, mostly they are just very rude to people who disagree with them and are very, very condescending.  I shouldn't have said ""for the most part"" though.  The majority of them are decent people who want what's best.  But they do seem to be more hostile in general than other candidate's followers in my experience."
93,Oh God no. No no no no no no no.
94,"There's a great book that goes into the insane negotiations that went on behind the scenes for the ACA. I wish I could remember the name of it! Anyway.

1) Al Franken couldn't be seated because Norm Coleman kept demanding for recount after recount until something like July 2009, because he was a spiteful little turd. 

2) Ted Kennedy passed away and Scott Brown won his seat.  

3) Joe Lieberman. The only reason that the public option didn't make it into the ACA is Joe Lieberman. The guy who Connecticut Dems primaried out of the Democratic senate race. The guy who ran anyway as an independent and won. The guy who was one of the ""Three Amigos"" with McCain and Lindsey Graham. He was the 60th vote and absolutely was in the pocket of the insurance industries. They were his biggest donors and he delivered for his supporters. No amount of horse trading, starting from a position of strength, asking for more and meeting in the middle would have worked. Biden tried. Harry Reid tried. Obama tried. He wasn't going to give. 

Because time was running out, they had to go with the only thing they had managed to pass - and even then it was a series of negotiations to get more moderate Dems on board. Landrieu held out for months and only gave in after they included provisions for increased medicaid funding for Louisiana. There were a few others whose arms were twisted pretty hard by Pelosi and Reid. 

The ACA is the furthest thing from perfect. But it really was the best they could do because Norm Coleman was a vindictive sore loser, Scott Brown got Kennedy's seat and Joe Lieberman is the worst person ever."
95,"That's really reassuring. I'm not stupid - our number one job is to end Citizens United and make elections function again. However, I feel like to get people excited we need some big bold ideas and I'm hopeful he has them."
96,"https://twitter.com/steveguest/status/1228157996074782721?lang=en

He forgot to memorize the whole phrase."
97,"Sanders is at a lower point this morning than Biden was at during the time of the Nevada caucuses (Feb. 22, 2020)."
98,I‚Äôm on it üç¶
99,Looks like Bernie is going to burn the small number of remaining bridges and scorch the earth down to the ground.
100,"Yeah this, he's just hoping Joe will have some kind of unforseen screwup at the debate as a miracle save for Bernie, imo."
101,Why arent there more people part of this sub?
102,Biden is clearly courting remaining Sanders supporters by using only the far left speaker.
103,"It's complicated : / 

Has a clear record of not supporting bans and evidence of personal thought being aligned there

But op is right that he didn't really make political statements in favor of it when in office and at times had made political statements saying stuff like not voting for doma was for essentially states rights reasons, not lgbt.  

They do this because as whicked smhat political operative, like Biden and Obama, they (Bernie and Jane) knew such statements posed political risk to their election campaigns

And they got their hands in the grease.  Good for them

104,How about *her* emails.
105,What's with all the Sanders spam showing up here lol
106,Senator Catherine Cortez Masto will be the pick
107,I signed up to do calls and texts for Biden judt today so im right there wirh you
108,I hope he sticks to that
109,"Search S4P on ""dementia"""
110,I have to give it to her for her persistence but it got to a point of being a stunt. Addressing the future of a campaign that hasn't been viable is needless  during a pandemic.
111,"I haven't been paying too much attention, but I did seem to notice a change in tone over at /r/Democrats2020, as well. A few weeks ago, any anti-Bernie stuff or mention of other candidates would draw a swarm of the stereotypical ""Bros"". That seems to have died down a bit."

113,"That‚Äôs not true.  Less than six non sequential months of a functional majority is the correct answer.  People died, rules changed on what it takes to pass legislation, and the GOP delayed getting senate seats filled.  Two years? Not even close."
114,You should take a breather...
115,It's a good strategy of politics is a larp and you don't care about consequences.
116,just need a neverbernie
117,None of them had significant AA support. The coalescing mostly happened after Biden's massive SC win.
118,"There are alot of people who have respect for her, even if she didn't get much votes in the primary.

No need to be hostile towards her."
119,Bloomberg is too financially invested and pompous to back out before ST.   But it was a huge mistake for him to even enter the race if his goal is to get Trump out of office
120,"Wonder who would replace Schumer once he hangs it up. 

I‚Äôm biased, but I would love a Majority Leader in Bob Casey."
121,"Biden has a history of actually getting things done, and he has the experience and skill to push his agenda through congress. Bernie is sincere, but yelling will only get you so far, and I don‚Äôt think his positions have the support to pass, and even if they could pass, he would be less able to get the votes than someone like Joe."

126,Thank you for being receptive! It‚Äôs a tough political climate and easy to get our guards up. But we‚Äôre on the same side.
127,"nah fam, if i want to see the end of the Republicans the party needs to be replaced with the LP, you'll thank me when it happens"
128,Surely though Bernie saying hes going to try is better than Biden not trying at all?
129,"I think, we're more aiming for Trump and republicans than for downtalking Sanders at this point.

Sanders is pretty done and over, no need to beat a dead horse. We've got bigger fishies to try."
130,"I feel that Warren would do well in some Treasury position in Biden's cabinet.

Imagine being a bigass corporation trying to run away from taxes. And then you get an email requesting your presence to tesify before Congress, and the guest of honor is..... *Elizabeth Warren*.

That's enough to make grown men to wet their pants upon reading the email."
131,It might be a blowout if the economy tanks this year because of coronavirus. Similar to Obama's victory in 2008.
132,Just wanted to say thanks for asking this question. Have needed some more logical answers to speak to my Bernie friends.
133,"Fox Polls are excellent and well respected. They are so good that Fox News barely uses them, in fact."
134,"In fact. They try to cite the time Trump did an impression of the reporter with the arm with the stunted growth (not actually cerebral palsy but something rarer I forget the name of) as 100 evidence Trump mocks disability when the guy doesn't actually have the kind of affectation Trump put on AND Trump does that style of impression about lots of people he wants to frame as hysterical. 

So yeah.. a lot of irony in making fun of an overt disability/speech impediment someone has struggled with his whole life. 

One thing I think they also miss or ignore on purpose is that besides sputtering out word fragments you can end up saying the wrong word entirely in your effort to stack blocks of words together and avoid stammering. The pressure of doing that would make you more prone to a general error. 

Dude also doesn't use 40 year old talking points and steer most questions back to fit with a pre prepared answer so yes, a lot more thinking on his feet for Joe

Good example of *Bernie* not having a good answer so fast was him getting questions from Maddow yesterday. He just got contradicted effectively several times because it was a developing situation and he wasn't triumphant"

144,Don‚Äôt get cocky! But yes if Biden sweeps tomorrow it‚Äôs hard for Bernie to make the case...
145,That Amy Klobuchar sound bide is hauntingly accurate. My goodness what a very effective ad!
146,Wearing my Warren pins. It‚Äôs a coalition.
147,"I‚Äôm in the same boat! For those who have supported Biden from the beginning, why? I can‚Äôt seem to feel passion about him like I have for Bernie. I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm settling."
148,"I'm hoping other states take strong action in allowing universal mail-in vote, especially the ones who vote on the 28th of April in the NE. Of the remaining states, Oregon is the only one with universal vote by mail and Washington state already proved that it can be done during a pandemic."
149,"That evil democratic establishment in which Biden invested exactly $0 in Massachusetts won.

Meanwhile NBC and CNN just raised Bernie's delegate count on a theory of his numbers in CA. Totally a douche establishment move!"
150,"I'm not a fan of giving oxygen to Trump's terrible arguments in general. Trump will be remembered as the worst President in the US history regardless of where the stock market lands. Even if the market somehow rebounds, President Obama will be remembered as the leader who didn't waver under pressure and brought us back from the brink.

That being said, let's have ice cream together!"
151,Yeah I agree with you.
152,"True, but I feel like him going on tv and being"" Biden is a rapist"", CNN, MSNBC, and the rest of the msm would hit back hard with allegations of their own. Maybe he's just digging his own grave, or maybe he's going to screw up Biden. Let's just hope this goes nowhere and the campaign continues as normal"
153,There are dozens of us!
154,Unrelated topic.   I see him as a warmonger.
155,"Having family in Minnesota my guess is she still wins delegates there tomorrow from people that want to support her anyway. I think Biden won't benefit as much there as he will in any other state because a bunch of farther left liberals there were supporting her because they really loved her as a representative, but they also like Bernie over Biden. 

But I think enough of her supporters will go to Biden so that he takes delegates out of the state, where as he wouldn't have otherwise, so it's probably a net gain for Biden there. And if I'm right and Klobuchar does end up winning delegates they will most likely be people who support the person she endorsed."
156,"All I see is a bunch ""7 minutes""

Brings me back to my elementary school days where ""NUH UH!!! NO, YOU'RE A STUPID POO POO HEAD!!! YOUR MOM IS FAT!!"" is the best comeback anyone could think of.

Someone needs to make a good 7 mInUtEs meme and just use it to respond whenever a Bernie bro think they're cool, edgy, and funny with their 7 minutes nonsense."

160,Pretty good interview.
161,The bernie people are sore losers
162,"My opinion:

First of all, Clinton is a woman and sexism is stronger than racism or even homophobia, IMO.

Clinton‚Äôs biggest mistake was the ‚Äúbasket of deplorables‚Äù. 

What I‚Äôve gleaned from reading others:

Second biggest mistake was thinking certain states were so blue that she didn‚Äôt need to visit them and concentrated on purple states.

As a Pete2Biden supporter, I think Pete showed that beckoning future former republicans to the right side of history is what allowed him to cross the party divide as much as he did."
163,"Personally I try to watch the international news channels or international news shows of various channels - BBC, France 24, Al Jazeera, NHK, etc. While they can be biased, sometimes very obviously so, because they are *international* they can't be too parochial and have to focus somewhat on the news, so if I'm aware of their bias I can usually account for that while digesting info."
164,r/politics is fair and balanced news the same way Fox News is
165,I've never been 2 a Biden rally.
166,"I have been doing a lot of independent research for a while but when I started talking to my friends and family I found that a lot of them felt uneasy about Bernie. Despite what I would say to defend him (I do think he is a powerful thought leader!) not much would change. It made me realize that there is a lot of restorative work that must be done before a political revolution occurs. I think that after Obama a Bernie presidency would have been great. However, after Trump I think the nation needs a bit more empathy and I see how Bernie's message could seem exclusionary to many people. Seeing how well Biden did in South Carolina definitely helped as well!"
167,"""Hold up, I'm still technically running?""

-Tulsi this morning"
168,So it's like Sanders putting that totally out of context clip of Obama in his ads saying 'feel the burn'? Classy. How can people someone who does so many misleading things especially in our current state of affairs?
169,Stay strong brother.
170,Noooooohhhhh
171,"Its true,  Bloomberg and 45 are arch enemies.   45 made fun of his height.    This is personal.

Bloomberg has a lot of policies that he is an avid proponent like gun violence.   45 will block all gun legislation while Biden will support it."

181,That was before this. This might have rubbed him the wrong way. Hes taking this more seriously than the majority of governors Democrat or Republican.
182,"Big oof on the blaming Bernie for 2016. You talk down to Bernie as an independent ‚Äúholier than thou‚Äù type, yet this whole post screams ‚ÄúI‚Äôm holier than thou because I‚Äôve been involved in centrist politics my whole life but want to claim what I‚Äôve been doing is progressive.‚Äù

Stick with Biden all ya want, but blaming Bernie for 2016 is why you‚Äôll lose the general in 2020. Don‚Äôt repeat Hilary‚Äôs mistakes."
183,"I'm very curious about whether they will stop doing rallies altogether at some points because of the Corona Virus. It's telling that there have been no campaign events in Washington State, even from the Bernie campaign. 

Will they even do rallies in Florida?"
184,Thank you!
185,"The state of Michigan says ""no malarkey"""
186,"Yang is very much an outsider having never been elected.    I'll give him credit that he is smart and knows his topics but he is a long shot.  The basic income stuff did not go over well with some people of various views as well.  All the Yang supporters I know here in Virginia voted for Joe.   Pete, Abrams, Amy are more likely."
187,Why do people not understand that Biden's history of working with Obama is basically his resum√©? Biden not mentioning Obama to make his case would be like if Warren never mentioned bills she helped pass or if Pete forgot to mention that he was a fucking mayor. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
188,Exactly he has so much potential to be attacked.
189,"As the polls have demonstrated, Sanders is polarizing and would turn off more moderate and conservative voters than we would gain.  The radical youth vote doesn't show up for vice presidents.

He does nothing for the electoral math (Democrats are going to win Vermont and California no matter what).  Frankly, this might be the only way we lose Florida.

He is attacking Biden right now.  And he's the oldest, sickest candidate in the race.

Absolutely not.  We are winning this election."
190,I'll do some phone banking if you will! We can win this thing
191,"Great, thanks!"
192,"The early poll numbers were never too good for Hillary. Trump outright led at several points as the primaries were winding down. While we obviously need to remain vigilant, this campaign has better life signs early on than the last one did."
193,As a mod over at /r/Pete_Buttigieg thanks for the kind words everyone.
194,"Yes, that's him. I call him DeRacist."
195,It‚Äôs fantastic
196,"A portion of Sanders base is made up of independents, myself included. I lean left, but there are others who lean right. The ones who lean right would not have voted Clinton just because they support sanders. In states like Michigan there is no political party registration required to vote in primary."
197,This is how Bidenis when he's not debating members of hisown party.  Oh I can't wait!
198,"On the issues important to everyday people, Biden is pretty similar to Trump."
199,"He will. its his go to move.  Takes a stance left of everyone else then tries to shame them.

207,"I knew that this is all lies. If someone, like this dishonest women, brings up a story of an alleged wrongdoing, and then ends up changing parts of it or all of it many times over, then you will know that the story is entirely all lies made up to smear any innocent person, like Joe. I think this woman Tera is a Kremlin Agent working for Putin to try to help rig the election in favor of Trump once more."
208,"My understanding is that it's typically not a good idea to announce your VP pick while the primary is technically still going, since waiting lets you put all your consideration towards how it affects the general, without having to worry about how it affects the primary. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if he's already made a decision (either formally or informally), and isn't making it public yet."

213,"And they're all over the place now complaining that Biden shouldn't be president because he's encouraging people to vote during a pandemic. Then in the next breath they say they hope on Biden voters stay home and convince people to bring a friend to the polls to vote for Bernie.

90% of the population is ignoring social distancing recommendations but they want everyone to *specifically* avoid voting. Target and bars are coll, just don't vote, for your health."
214,Can we get the other non-viable moderates to drop out? We all need to unite behind Joe.
215,"I have a few problems with blanket reduction of loans: 

1 - It encourages current students and recent graduates to take out more debt / not pay it down, as you will be punished for paying off your loans early if eventual relief goes through. 

2 - You can spend student loans on basically whatever the fuck you want. No one is auditing your spending to make sure it's on school expenses. You literally could buy cocaine and a 87 whale tail porsche with your student loan money. What's stopping someone from taking 2 community college classes, taking out $10k in loans, just to get releif? 

3 - It punishes those who scrimped and saved to pay off their student loans early. That is not behavior the government should be encouraging."
216,You're 100% right. The Bros have sustained such a toxic atmosphere toward anyone that is not Bernie that it would be an embarrassment for all Dems.

252,"If you wanna be excited for Biden, look at when he's fucked up, and look at what he did after.   No one is perfect, everyone makes mistakes and/or bad decisions.  But Biden really understands that he made a mistake and tries to rectify it.  


Take Anita Hill.  He fucked that up, and it's a major fuck up, IMO.   But he knew he fucked that up and worked really hard on the Violence Against Women Act.  Now OP, you're a young guy, you don't remember what it was like before the VAWA.  I was young when it passed, but I remember.  My sister was date raped and the cops did NOTHING.  She spent 3 whole days in the hospital because of that degenerate scumbag, and he got away with it.   Date rape, spousal abuse, that was ""domestic issues"" (aka the patriarchy's favorite bullshit) and cops didn't get involved.   The VAWA changed that, and now not only do cops get involved, but abused women get the help they need to leave abusive relationships.  We need the VAWA reauthorized, republicans won't vote on it because they hate women.   


So Biden took down a major policy of the patriarchy AND he went up against the NRA and won. 


Maybe Biden isn't as progressive as Sanders, but I truly believe he's actually made more progress than most politians in this country."
253,Probably unnecessary now that Bloomberg is on the team.
254,I figured as much unfortunately. I early vote in Ohio and it was packed. I think Dewine made the right call regarding delaying it.

257,In what way is he to the right of Obama? His platform is left of what both Obama and Hillary ran on. Apparently he was the one urging Obama to support gay marriage too.
258,"Yes, that's bound to happen. Bloomberg had heavy mail-in vote which was already reported. Biden vote was late vote.

Biden's #s in California will continue to grow over night and through the week."
259,"Honestly, I'm gonna be a little disappointed if Pete isn't in the Biden administration. I'm not sure I'm ready to hope for VP, lord knows I'm already disappointed enough, but I'd love to see Pete as something like Secretary of State or Cheif of Staff."
260,Really good point.
261,"Yeah, basically here is my belief somewhat simplified   
I think college should be more affordable by some means. Maybe more grants &amp; scholarships. Maybe limit the amount tuition should go up each year. Again, I don't have great ideas for changing the way it works...but that's not my job.   
However, I also think that there are many options that are already at that point.   
I think if someone decides to go to an out of state crazy expensive school across the country, then they should pay for it. I do NOT think they should pay for it with a crazy high interest rate loan. But they should pay for it.  
There are many options for good schools.   
From my experience in state schools were much cheaper, and I had many high school friends attend those schools and have already paid off their student debt.  
There are many options to get cheaper school. For example: Go to a community college first, or take some classes there.  
There are also other options to go to school for free. I worked for free college.  


I would be okay with a tech / trade school becoming free. For example Plumber / HVAC / EMT / Electrician. I think I saw somewhere Biden was in support of 2-year trade school for free, and I could support that.  


Does that answer your question somewhat?"
262,"His comments about the cruise ship were some true ""does he know he is saying that out loud"" crap. 

In that moment alone he communicated to the public that if there is ANY way in which it seems like throwing them under the bus would help him even for an hour he would endanger them without hesitation."
263,About the Social Security stuff
264,"For me I realize beating trump will be very difficult regardless. 

Joe ha experience turning around a recession. That is very likely happening again.

Joe has experience getting a massive healthcare plan through. He already knows what it will take to get a public option through.

Winning in the general is paramount. Progress is very important to me as well.

I would have a hard time voting for bernie and I'm a lifelong democrat. I know I am not alone. Republicans want bernie to be the nomination. Russia wants Bernie to get the nomination. I just flat out believe Bernie will lose in the general election."
265,Here?
266,"Yeah, Bernie‚Äôs Bullies ridiculed and managed to piss off every other candidates supporters. 

I was a Bernie supporter who liked Beto then Warren then Yang then Pete then Biden. The vitriol and vemon they threw at every single other candidate kept me far far away from Bernie.

 Bernie is an amazing person but his supporters are almost as toxic and vile Trump supporters. 

Horseshoe theory..."
267,I‚Äôve been seeing conflicting reports all day. I‚Äôll be happy if this is it
268,"Isn‚Äôt that just excusing a ‚Äúless brave‚Äù approach? Wait for someone else to propose what the country really needs and then jump on board with incremental solutions to catastrophic problems enabling the status quo‚Äôs inertia to perpetuate? 

An 8.5% private tax (without Bernie‚Äôs first $29K exception in his M4A proposal) which leaves the healthcare cost curve worse, bankruptcies, our-of-network shenanigans, copays, deductibles... I mean, why can‚Äôt Joe get it done and put something in place to take care of all people? As long as we have the current system, we‚Äôll still have people broke and unable to get healthcare because of cost. Why isn‚Äôt this faced up to at least? 

It‚Äôs really sad that, just like we saw with Obamacare‚Äôs incremental approach to this problem, we‚Äôre on pace to keep discussing the broken healthcare system again in 10 years. 

Is this the best we can hope for? Seriously?"
269,"Pete is the epitome of class and country over personal gain. 

I donated to his campaign at the beginning, and hope that I get the opportunity to do so again in the future. Thank you Pete! Team Joe is forever grateful. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
270,"&gt; I don't see the coalition holding. What will destroy it is a candidate losing the pledged delegate count but winning due to super delegates, so let's hope that never happens

I mean't to reply to this as well, but got caught up in work... stupid work getting in way of my Redditing :P  
  
I see the point, and I don't *fundamentally* disagree that by using super delegates to over-turn a candidate would disenfranchise their supporters.

But I am also a staunch follower of the rules. The rules were known going in, Bernie had a decent (Positive) influence on ""the establishment"" rules, changing them while the contest is underway is simply unfair to all involved.   
      
Luckily I don't think it'll come down to that. I don't want to get cocky and pull a Hillary, but I foresee a decent sweep. Look at ST, add Bloomberg's numbers to Biden, and I'll even be cautious and give Bernie Warren's (although I think hers are decently split). There is a fair difference, and that's with early voting for Pete (mine) and Amy stuck in many states. Their votes won't all go to Biden, but I'd argue that more than 50% will.   
  
Now add a week of Pete, Amy, Beto, (Warren?), campaigning for Biden further solidifying the message of unity and decency.   
  
Unless Biden royally F's it up (not completely out of the realm of possibility), or if Bernie increases his turnout by ~50% (Also not impossible), he may even have a path to majority."

277,No they don't. They are the same directionally on every issue. Biden's policies are pretty much exactly what Bernie's policies would be if Bernie actually crafted them in a version that could be passed through congress.

But I do understand the frustration. 

There have been countless times where I have spoken with some Bernie supporters (on the internet) respectfully and then after one minor disagreement I get hit with ""talking like that won't win us progressives over to vote for Biden in the general"". 

And I'm just left thinking, what did I even say? I respectfully disagreed on a minor thing. The sensitivity to criticism towards Sanders for some of the supporters is ridiculous"

I think Biden needs a progressive VP to get the young vote in the general, and polls show Yang is very popular for VP (second choice in the last poll I saw). To be fair, Warren is an excellent choice too and Yang can still do some good at Tech related cabinet position. 

Honestly, I care more about his policies being implemented than seeing him as president and I think Yang does so too."

319,Are the results showing differently for you all? Biden is down 30k in Texas
320,"&gt;do you really want to celebrate Mike Bloomberg's endorsement?

The Bernie talking point that anything a billionaire does or says is bad is not one of his better ones.  The *existence* of the billionaire class is undoubtedly bad for our society, but individual billionaires are in fact people, and can have both good and bad points, and can do good as well as bad.

Bloomberg has plenty of bad points, both as a politician and as a person, but he did plenty of good as mayor of NYC, and had many supporters there, pretty much across the political spectrum as far as I've seen...he didn't align well with any particular political party.

His presidential run was by all accounts a failure, but I've seen plenty of people saying they support him, and if his endorsement can nudge them into Joe's camp, yes, that's a good thing..."

334,Never have I heard a better speech for conceding. It's a pretty damn good one.
335,nah... neither Bernie or Biden are blue Trump. Trump has never done anything in government and has no idea what it means to be a public servant. I do worry a bit about some of how Bernie's ideas tend to divide people and the party but I think that is unintentional on his part. Trump is dividing up people completely on purpose. We would do well to have either Bernie or Biden as president. However I like Biden's approach more and he has a lot more foreign policy experience than Bernie does. Our foreign relations are all messed up. Bernie is mostly a domestic policy guy which is fine but we need someone that is strong both in foreign and domestic policy. Also we need someone who is going to make more measured changes and that can build consensus within party with republicans. Biden has a much better chance at that than Bernie.

I don't think this is something he or Bernie could have done alone, but they could lead by rejecting corporate influence.

&gt;Biden received a lot of endorsements but a candidate who welcomes a broad coalition can expect that. Why is that improper?

I don't think it's improper. I also think that all candidates welcome a broad coalition, much as they ask for everyone's vote. If you consider volunteers, and donors, I don't think you can really compare Bernie's grass roots movement to Biden. I totally acknowledge that Biden has won the votes, my claim is that I worry Biden is winning those because he is ""safe"".

386,"Let's not rewrite history, here.  Going to war was very much against any notion of peacekeeping (one might recall that Mohamed ElBaradei and the IAEA went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize after all their efforts were swept aside by our warmaking).  And a vote for the Iraq war resolution hinged entirely on whether or not one believed the Administration's lies, both about their intent and Iraq's weapons capabilities.  As Biden himself put it, ""I trusted George Bush to keep his word.""  America abdicated our role in the world as a leader by acting unilaterally.   
 I proudly partly marched in the [mass protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_February_2003_anti-war_protests) against the war, while 7 in 10 of my fellow Americans thought Iraq attacked us on 9/11, which is where most of the public support for the war came from.

Biden's a very flawed lawmaker.  I'll have no problem volunteering for him when he clinches the nomination, but it's hard to say, ""look at how much he accomplished"" when some of what he accomplished was absolutely horrifying like harassing Anita Hill and rolling out the red carpet out for Clarence Thomas,  or helping to gather Democratic support for Bush's war based on lies.  Should we celebrate the fact that Biden was more effective at holding the country back than Sanders was at pushing the country forward?  At least Biden tried to redeem himself on gay rights after setting them back in the 90s.  I think he'll make a passable president who will continue to make big mistakes.   But at least they'll be mistakes, not deliberate harm inflicted on our most vulnerable.  I'm hardly a Bernie fanatic (I supported Warren this go-around), but to me and many others, it comes down to judgment.  But electability trumps judgment this year, so I know how this will end.  And hopefully that'll lead to Trump out of office."

2)Primary is held, outcome follows the polls, Biden wins and people get blamed for having an election during this time

3)Primary is held, turnout is low which allows Sanders to beat the polls.  Unlikely and a dangerous option, since the point of elections is to measure the will of the people.  Not giving them a fair opportunity to express their views and using a crisis to skew the outcome and the narrative isn't a good way for Sanders to win."

It is certainly easier to live in the Midwestern city, but my mortgage is lower than most rentals, there is almost no public transportation, and WIC and food stamps are still necessary. $1000 extra a month would be great, but what do we do for those who lose all benefits? That is the goal under UBI. What it creates is a more pronounced black market, underground economy, which damages the most vulnerable."

405,"That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs all positive for us.  It might push Bloomberg over the viability threshold in a few states that he‚Äôs struggling in and thus allow him to collect more delegates.


Look, Bernie Bros are going to be disappointed either way if Biden ends up as the nominee.  However, the only way that there aren‚Äôt riots on the floor of the convention is if Joe is hopefully leading the delegate count going into the convention.

414,"I'm pretty sure he didn't say that. What he did say is that we aren't adequately prepared under the existing system. Saying that universal healthcare in other countries isn't working, as Biden did, is disingenuous. Italy has administered over 80k tests as of March 12 and the US had only administered 13k as of that date. When Italy had about 2.5k cases of COVID-19, their hospitals could still manage it. The US is at 3.5k cases and we're already seeing shortages. There are a ton of people complaining about not being able to get tested even while symptomatic, they're being taken through a maze of red tape to even get the chance (this is changing, but slowly). Of course every system is going to reach limits. The point here is that the US system is already reaching them and if we had M4A to begin with, the crisis could've been *managed and contained* better, not *averted*. Italy's system, for the most part, is doing its job to the best of its ability. Ours isn't. Simple as that."

418,"That's fair. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and you can approach the situation however you'd like.

I'm just saying that if you want to have a meaningful and productive conversation, it helps to have some level of knowledge of the topic.

With most conversations of this nature, it's not about saying whatever you want to and forcing the other party to come to your side. That never works. A better approach is to say the things that need to be said in order to elicit your desired response. If your desired response is argument and frustration, working from a position of ignorance will do just fine. If your desired response is mutual understanding and a change of mind, other methods may be more effective."
419,"It's just so painful. Bernie spoiled me with his lifelong consistency to being brave and standing for what's right *before* it was popular and/or widespread, especially in the political arena. A man who fights for the future today. We'll end up voting for Biden but it will be somewhat bitterly. To me, there will never be a man like him in public office again. The progressive peeps we have now don't have to be forward or brave as the ideas are in place, they just need to be strong. But going back decades, there he was, advocating for the future. It makes me so incredibly sad. I'm completely spoiled. He gave me hope again, but it's not going anywhere. Its crushing.

432,"This is how you build coalitions. You don't personally attack people. You don't attack their motives. Their policies are fair game. But them personally, and their families; that's strictly off limits."
433,"Hot take: What about Katie Porter for VP?
-She‚Äôs young and energetic
-She‚Äôs progressive enough to excite young voters but also willing to compromise and not seen as radical
-She‚Äôs great on camera 
-She may not be the most experienced, but her time as a law professor means she knows the ins and outs of government, and she‚Äôs at least serving in Congress (looking at you, Stacy Abrams)
-She has a great story about growing up poor in Iowa"
434,"Surprised more people aren't talking about her. I think she is perfect.

She has loads of experience. Will pretty much guarantee the 'Mum' vote. And can definitely help win back the key battleground states e.g. Michigan, Ohio etc."
435,Won't someone think of the poor billionaires?!
436,Just got handed a one-day from r/politics for ‚Äúincivility‚Äù when the real reason is because I was making excellent arguments against Bernie.
437,Very promising. The guy literally has over 30 years to run for president.
438,"Well and what's amazing about these theories is that they overlook very basic things. For example, how is the DNC rigging the primaries in states where Republicans are in control, like SC? These people actually believe that SC's very, very R leadership would rig the primary in favor of Biden, who is far more competitive against Trump in a heavily R state like SC, as opposed to Bernie. And they think the D states are doing the same thing. 

In their thinking, it's a vast conspiracy of everyone at every level against Bernie because he's so popular. It makes zero sense. Especially when one starts thinking about the actual logistics involved (the DNC does not operate or control all the primaries, people). 

The simple explanation, which is that Bernie's support just has a ceiling, just isn't possible to them. Of course, it's totally reasonable that everyone else's support has a ceiling, and they're sure that the votes are higher than the ceiling for every other D candidate. But not for Bernie. 

The trick for understanding their thought process for me is to just realize that Bernie has some serious narcissistic tendencies. And his movement reflects those traits. Basically, he's special, they're special, and anyone who doesn't recognize that is terrible or stupid or both. And he shouldn't have to compromise and they shouldn't have to compromise because only they are right and everyone else is wrong."
439,Because he‚Äôs not Bernie.
440,"Bernie has been in the Senate for 13-14 years and was in the House since 1991 and it doesn't seem like he has a ton of allies but not a lot of enemies either.   The M4A or bust attitude will not work.   The ""movement"" got a few house members elected which is remarkable but I don't think it is enough.  I can't say for certain that even with a 51-49 Dem advantage that my 2 moderate Senators will vote for it.    Steve Bullock gets elected in Montana so it will be hard to get reelected in deep red Montana if he votes for it.    Eliminating the filibuster and getting the 300+ bills off of Mitch's desk should be the main objective."
441,"Watch his town halls. He just did a great one this past week on CNN. He isn't the best speaker, and in the crowded forum of these ""debates"" he doesn't fare so well. When he has more time to speak out his thoughts he does better. He is loaded with facts."
442,Definitely a huge factor as well!
443,"Eh, the conditions were just ripe for trump in 2016 there."
444,As a bernie supporter (who recognizes that bernies chance this go around is pretty much done) I totally agree. We need need a young fresh face as VP
445,"Biden only has to win back Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. If he takes VA, South Carolina, AND Arizona? Who knows what else? That'll be a huge win. A blue tsunami, even, if it goes all the way down ballot."
446,"He's going to lose Florida by 30+, Ohio and Illinois by 20+ and Arizona by 10+.

Compare that to 2016 when on Super Tuesday he won Colorado, Minnesota, and Oklahoma, then on March 5th got Kansas and Nebraska. He was splitting primary wins with Clinton pretty well, and it was reasonable for him to remain in. The outlook now is that he won't win a single more primary."
447,"Man what is with the hate here? How about we direct all our sanders hate, and focus it on trump?"
448,"Yes. If his next long-form interview isnt run by a combination of shaun evans(hot ones),jon stewart, and Hank green than im not interested"
449,"Yes, even if the presidential campaign ends, remaining states will still need to figure out a safe way to hold primaries (might be vote by mail)."
450,And? Do uneducated people not need to exist anymore? Do they not get a voice? Do they not matter?
451,Well you definitely live up to your username. I‚Äôll give you that.
452,"If it's Obama, then Sanders really wasted his money with his Obama ad."
453,"&gt;Her and Pete are nationally known, have more enthusiasm than Biden  
&gt;  
&gt; Again, I'm not comparing to Biden. 

okay wait one dadgum second

&gt; What random person would you suggest that would have a better argument? 

Well, I probably wouldn't go with a random person. I'd go with a Senator or Governor. I'd want to look for someone who's well-qualified on day one, someone with broad appeal, particularly among independents, and ideally someone who can help jump latino turnout. I'm not worried about progressive turnout, because in the states progressives have a lot of electoral power, democrats are already going to win. We don't need to guard California and New York. We need North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania. 

I think having a woman on the ticket is going to be a pretty strong asset. I'd look closely at Baldwin, Duckworth, maybe Grisham (though I don't know enough about her and haven't seen her speak)."
454,That youth vote though. Pulling in clutch for Sanders. Why would build a strategy on these guys again?
455,Thank you!  I hadn‚Äôt seen that before!
456,"They did the same for Sanders in Nevada, it's called exit polling and it gives a pretty clear understanding of how people voted."
457,Your favorite subreddits suggest malarkey
458,with you?
459,Trump is not going to change. He can fake it for about 5 min then goes back to himself.
460,I've noticed that too. I used to consider myself a progressive but if that's what it takes then I guess maybe I'm not. *shrug*
461,"&gt; I hope *she‚Äôs* right

FTFY"
462,"So true. I'm for M4A, but I want the public option more, and first, so that the government can at least lay down the basic infrastructure of providing insurance to so many more people and very gradually phase out some aspects of private insurance, so that all the people who work in that sector won't now suddenly be out of a job.

That doesn't make me part of the anti-Bernie conspiracy, or the establishment, or whatever else they want to label me with."
463,"Good to know your passion is still alive, dude! We had different experiences being welcomed here from the Sanders camp, but I'm glad you're being welcomed with opened arms and minds!"
464,Is the Jessie Jackson endorsement a huge deal? Is it as big as Rep. Clyburn's?
465,I‚Äôm starting to feel bad for Sanders supporters ‚Äî I pretty much agree with all of them on principle but disagree on how to get there. It‚Äôs disheartening to see how broken many of the seem.
466,"&gt; But in a statement shared first with WMUR on Friday, Hassan said:
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúWe need a president who can bring Americans together, and I am confident that Joe Biden has the experience and character to lead our country forward.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúJoe has what it takes to help expand middle class opportunity, demonstrate leadership on the world stage and ensure that our democracy includes everyone.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúThat's why I voted for him and that's why I believe we must work together to make Joe Biden the next President of the United States.‚Äù"
467,"He wants to decriminilize marijuana, expunge prior records of marijuana convictions, and leave the federal government out of the way for states that want to legalize it further. It's not a major issue for his platform so he's not gone into detail on the specifics, but decriminilization does kind of imply a rescheduling, so I imagine that would have to happen."
468,Money and idiocy. Many governors and mayors just not taking this seriously at all.
469,It will definitely impact him more negatively than it otherwise would but I still think it‚Äôs better for him to get votes now than chance it 2 months from now. He‚Äôs red hot at present and racking up more delegates now makes Bernie‚Äôs path even harder and puts more pressure on him to drop out.
470,My point is simply that you can do that without also actively pushing people away. But whatever.
471,"I have one of the weirder voting records. 2008 I voted in the primary for Hillary. Of course I supported Obama (though it was a bit with a grudge). I did not regret that vote of course. But then in 2016 I picked Bernie over Hillary (She already won - I wanted to send a message to listen to the youth and left). And this time I'm putting Joe over Bernie. Not because I disagree with Bernie's views but... At end of day, America is more in tune with Joe. Incrementalism is better than nothing. It's not exactly a beautiful song but it is life in the USA right now. It's not an electability thing. It is a reality issue."
472,They turned 4 years ago. We forgot about it.
473,"Uh Biden is very much against marijuana. No way in hell he's decriminalizing it. Trump, on the other hand, has stated he would sign a bill enforcing decriminalization if it came across his desk."
474,"That's not how monetary policy works. It was 1.5 trillion into the repo credit market. It's a marketplace for treasury backed loans to support cash flow. The loans have to paid back either in less than two weeks, 30 days, or 90 days. The purpose is to offset risk in the overnight markets and encourage liquidity. There is no Indication that the money went in to the stock market. The stock market fluctuated in reaction to the repo infusion, not from it. 

Note: I'm making no argument that the fed's move was either good or bad."
475,"Or Booker for Biden

That alliteration thooo"
476,Good for you üëç Thank you‚ÄºÔ∏è
477,"Yeah, I'm hoping that Bernie maybe learned something from 2016, I could be totally wrong of course, but we'll find out in less than a week."
478,love this. United we stand. Let's build a wall of unity.
479,And my mother's name is Tamara.
480,"Honestly, I just sink Trump with Corona virus stuff. Thats honestly all Biden has to do at this point. Parade it across the states and make them remember, and he wins."
481,"She was disliked due to decades of attacks from Republicans, often sexist ones."
482,not surprised that it got downvote bombed
483,Moral of the story: VP pick doesn‚Äôt fundamentally change outcome in national polls.
484,"I'm a Pete Buttigieg supporter because the message of unity is important to me. This speech by Biden gives me confidence in him. I think that's why I'm a bit apprehensive towards Bernie, which is his ""angry"" demeanor. It would have been strategic for Bernie to adopt the ""unity"" message, and later on implement his grand strategy of dismantling the 1%. Statecraft is important in all of this, and Biden plays it well."
485,"Going to be real here, Bernie still is likely to win a plurality of the delegates, maybe at the DNC they‚Äôll have a brokered convention, I can‚Äôt imagine many Klob voters would wantSanders over Biden. I was a Pete guy until yesterday and though we‚Äôve been split pretty evenly among the remainder I hope somehow we can fnangle a way to make out IA delegates go to you guys."
486,What's the plan just to exist? Biden clapped Bernie so hard that he's actually irrelevant
487,Ima go with accelerationism
488,"Mfw reading all the comments in pro-Bernie subreddits thie last week that were convinced Biden was going to ""reveal his dementia"" at the debate tonight causing people to vote for Bernie by a landslide"
489,Welcome fellow patriot! LEt's restore this nation's soul!
490,"Biden should pick Duckworth as VP so she can kick the crap out of Trump and Pence when they go low.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5iRvUK5A0U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5iRvUK5A0U) 

I'd like to think that Stone went all out to kill Franken's career because the GOP was scared of a female nominee picking him as VP. He would have destroyed Pence in a debate like Biden did with Ryan."
491,Thank you!!
492,"I wouldn't say it's fake, because 94% of precincts are reporting, which has always been the standard for reporting. They're just not reporting all their votes. It's misleading.

The standard needs to change for states with mail-in voting."
493,NY Times just called MO for Biden with 0% reporting. Now that‚Äôs confidence.
494,He‚Äôs literally backed by billionaires
495,He can‚Äôt stop his supporters. He has been whipping them up into a frenzy since 2016. They take their cues from him and his staff.
496,"That's less a philosophy and more of just an individual policy. How do we decide what the public ought to pay for? And very importantly, when the public is asked to pay for something, how much say over that do they now get?"
497,Former Yang supporter here as well! Still love the guy but rooting for Joe at this point. We need someone to bring this country together and to restore decency and integrity back in the office. I wholeheartedly believe Joe can do that. Let‚Äôs do this!
498,Spam. Could qualify as harassment too I think
499,and I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if they massaged the algorithm a bit to be more favorable to Bernie
500,K A M A L A
501,Went to Sanders' Twitter and couldn't find the tweet. Did he delete it?
502,I think voting by mail will be the standard after this

505,"If polls hold true tomorrow and next week, Bernie will have to drop out.

If he trully cares for Democratic party, he will offer to drop out and endorse Biden in exchange for implementing Ranked Choice Voting for future presidential primaries.

After Iowa debacle and many wasted votes in Super Tuesday, everyone is in mood to reform party primaries."

This cannot be done by mere Executive Order, nor is there any law that became such without the imprimatur of the House."
515,"No, it's even remotely the same. That's roughly a 33% truth at best.

Joe is nothing like Hillary.

The turnout numbers show it."
516,"This is a really good insight. One thing that hasn't been priced in to Sanders' polls nationally is all the shit he's put the Dem party through at various points over the last 5 years is going to spill over onto the general electorate. I don't know if it would work, but I can't imagine it helping us too much. There's always a double standard for the left and they need to realize that sharpish."

560,"Bernie and Biden had such a huge head start. Either one of those guys would have had to stumble hard to allow someone else to overcome the notoriety and relationships they have.

Jim C had said he would support Amy, Liz or Joe.  If the impeachment hadn't happened, Bernie, Liz and Amy could have campaigned in Iowa, NH and Nevada and the results would have been a little different, I would think. Pete had a wide open field in Iowa to work his magic uncontested for months.  There is no doubt in my mind Amy would have done WAY better in Iowa, she carried the MN red counties across the border in 2018."

Rather than getting upset about her not being ‚Äúwoke‚Äù enough he appreciated the fact that she was coming to terms with the changing world in her own way, one that wasn‚Äôt intended to be disrespectful.

But to become president, he's going to have to at least get some fraction of Bernie supporters, and the easiest way to do that is rhetorically ""move left"" at least on things he doesn't think are too politically damaging for the general. Even if he's just lying, it's what the Bernie people want to hear. So just do it to get their votes."
574,The other day a Bernie bro time me to kill myself and I retorted it and it wasn't removed. I mocked a bros comment in another thread later and for banned for a day.it's such a shit show.
575,"Dude, I know it‚Äôs fun to be a troll but please stop."
576,"Lol you‚Äôve got to be kidding me!

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs evil! And not a Democrat! And millions of people LOVE him!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, he‚Äôs totes dividing people!‚Äù

Lmfao"
577,"I just want this to be such a shellacking that Bernie has to drop out.  

poll volunteers tend to be older folks...   
He should drop out before then anyway. 

Like, someone will likely die unnecessarily because of Bernie's vanity project."
578,"Duckworth, tho"
579,A bit premature. IMO. There's plenty more room to fall.
580,"It was Bloomberg who brought it up, but when Bernie pointed out that he said the same thing about Castro as Obama, Biden was saying that Bernie and Obama were drastically different. In the actual videos of the statements, Obama actually gave more praise. Biden could have just ket bernie defend himself and point out that these ideas, which you say we fundamentally agree on, are not radical ideas.

I agree with you analysis, but if Bernie has spent 50 years not budging on these ideas, and now they finally fundamentally agree that these same ideas are good, why go for biden all of a sudden. If they are fundamentally the same, vote Bernie and compromise a little if we have to. I feel like Biden would just give up honestly."
581,"You literally said I‚Äôm not a real progressive. You called my post fake. You said I switched to Biden because Pete and Amy did. None of those were true. You have built straw man after straw man to misrepresent what I‚Äôve said so you can dismiss it easily.

Until you acknowledge that and check yourself for why that‚Äôs happening, I don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôll listen to me anymore now than you refused to when you read my first post to begin with."
582,Even if its only 1.7% of the Dem voter base we'll take it!
583,"Same story my friend. No shade to anyone with different philosophy or ideas but he is simply the worst advocate in terms of prominence, for the notion of some kind of decency in our faith.

It would warm my heart to see any true charity or grace in the man. It's there in some of his GOP enemies though. Weld,Romney and (RIP) McCain for example. 

Hope you and all the other fine folks here are staying safe and same for all the extended family and friends we have too."
584,"You go, you MO fo Joe hoe!"
585,Former YangGang here as well!
586,I am glad to see Joe Biden join in with Sanders‚Äô recommendation. Having companies help where they can is dire.
587,I would like nothing more than to see that. Joe would be a fool not to include him.
588,"Not so much the recession. His reaction to what‚Äôs causing the recession. 

He‚Äôs taking this virus as a personal attack. The virus doesn‚Äôt care. The virus has no emotion. It is a virus and it‚Äôs sole purpose is to spread the disease. 

His inaction with the coronavirus is causing this recession. He could‚Äôve had a great presidential moment, but each time it‚Äôs offered he literally shits himself with his incompetence."
589,"Perhaps that's because Bernie supporters actually believe in him and his message, rather than believing ""my candidature lies repeatedly on stage, but hey at least he isn't orange amirite?"""
590,This is what a good president sounds like. Sanders would morph his response into his stupid stump speech
591,"There is no cognitive decline. He isn't a great speaker and has a stutter, plus people capitalize whenever they can take his words out of context. Look at how their are attackers saying he mixed up his wife and sister. Anyone who saw that knows it was just them switching spots behind him, yet you have people claiming it shows he has dementia."
592,"I voted for Bernie in the 2016 primary, but more because I didn't like Hillary than because I did like him (I've mellowed on her a lot since then but at the time I was super resentful and suspicious that it took her so much of her career to decide she's pro-gay marriage). But when he lost, I was like ""ok obviously we're voting Hillary now, right guys...? guys? hello?"" 

So I think I knew going into this I wouldn't vote for Bernie because of the way he responded to losing to Hillary with literally zero grace or dignity whatsoever, but after everything his people have done to Pete since then? HELLLLL no. I wouldn't vote for him for student class treasurer at this point."
593,us senator from Colorado Michael Bennett
594,"Alright. 

But I also want to be mindful that one can have productive disagreements and conversations with racists as well. It‚Äôs the exact mentality that ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt listen to a word you say because  you said something I don‚Äôt like‚Äù that‚Äôs destructive to a functional democracy. I understand the n word is almost as bad as it gets, but even so why do people need to be characterized immediately? This was meant to dismiss and cancel."
595,"The sad thing is I feel like if Joe challenges Trump like this, it will make Trump want to do the opposite out of spite."
596,Weird how Obama hasn‚Äôt endorsed Joe yet huh? Seems weird to me that he wouldn‚Äôt endorse his own VP....
597,Pence wasn't why Indiana went for Trump.  We HATED Pence as governor.  He had a 30% approval rating in 2016.
598,"I voted by mail as a lot of people do in Florida as it is open to everyone, but here have the head of the Bernie campaign actively telling Bernie supporters to keep their older relatives from voting.

Now team Bernie is mad and trending on twitter at the DNC for not cancelling the primary when it is up to the states.

This i from Team Bernie ""Senior adviser"" saying it is not safe to vote on Tuesday. She has been spreading this for days. Tell your older relatives not to vote in Florida because they might die.

603,"I've seen more (positive) active non-US interest in this election than ever before. It is appreciated, and drives home the point that what 5% of the world's population gets to vote on drastically impacts the other 95%. It is a far greater responsibility than the vast majority of Americans understand or appreciate. 

I am curious, though, as to why your opinion isn't popular within your social circle?"
604,"Along with what others have written, I think that Hillary was probably just referring to the demographic groups at the core of his support. So she's right that it's (largely) the same type of coalition but it also looks like he's turning out that coalition more successfully.

Regardless I think lots of people will feel nervous about a repeat of the 2016 election until results come in, but there are valid reasons for thinking Biden has a much better chance even with a very similar coalition."
605,"Wow, such different results that it may be tough to call on this one."

611,Exactly. Every Biden flaw imagined or real is worse in Trump and Biden‚Äôs policies are more exiting to more people.
612,Other than that it‚Äôs going perfectly...
613,"Cal's polling pretty well, though, and may help us flip the senate. However, from what I understand a lot of it may be just because people really, really dislike Thom Tillis and so who knows if it will translate to the presidential election.

Edited: I also think NC may be easier than WI. More young people moving in because of the growing tech industry, and a large population of eligible Black voters who almost always vote Dem."
614,The main issue here isn't even the left. It is a general fall to populism in disfavor of what really defines politics: compromise. Both the rise of Trump and Bernie can be attributed to this hyperpartisan idea of having a final swoop to get rid of everything bad. The tendency to see everybody other than ourselves as the antithesis to our own being is a bad thing. We need more unity.
615,About time!
616,"FR they've had a dozen debates already and one just 10 days ago. That one [didn't go as Sanders fans planned](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-sanders-debate-poll/) so they want a do-over. Fucking lol.

It's clear Sanders supporters are acting in bad faith. They're hoping Joe Biden shits his pants or drops dead on live TV."

626,can somebody explain the gator to me
627,"Wow! I hope you're joking really... This is a very sad way of thinking. We're not talking about Trump here. If you believe in Biden, you should also think of Bernie as a nice guy because that's how Biden sees him (also don't mix people with their most toxic supporters). Bernie is still in the race, even if he's quite behind. There's no rule saying someone has to drop out when everyone believes he won't win (or else Biden would be out for a long time). The excuse of COVID-19 popped up lately as a reason he should give up but the fact people say he should give up is nothing new. It is the responsibility of people organizing the elections to ensure the safety of people voting, not of the candidates themselves, because this would then become a very convenient way to undermine democracy. What would you say if these were the real elections and people were saying Biden should give up so people don't have to risk their lives voting ?"
628,"This probably means Biden will pick a white female VP pick.  Smart to use Obama to give cover to not pick a non-African American.  As a minority, I really don't care if his VP pick is male, female, black or purple as long as they're competent.  The objective is to get rid of Trump, get rid of all his flying monkeys in the Congress, and hopefully put many of them into jail.  That's the only objective."
629,can we just skip to the part where biden beats trump i'm so bored
630,"A presidential debate is basically a messaging contest where the goal is to convince people you are the guy. If your performance doesn't change minds, and you are already losing the real vote counts, you lost. Nobody is sitting there with a notepad keeping score of who won each exchange to be tallied up at end."
631,"Warren voter for Biden here, too. This echoes a lot of my thinking, although having experienced a toxic Sanders supporter face-to-face in 2016, I have been wary of that campaign for some time (I know some very nice ones, too, but...wow. It's hard to forget that kind of vitriol when it's aimed at your face from a couple feet away.) Also remember that, if Biden is elected, he'll actually be the most liberal president ever elected, by some measures."
632,I think her or Amy. Not kamala
633,"&gt;But man, imagine what he‚Äôd do with a good ground game too.

Those words just gave me an orgasm"
634,"I see. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs happening in those primaries, but a lot of money is being directed at the Colorado senate race in support of Hickenlooper not because of the primary, which he will win overwhelmingly, but because they want to build him up for the general which will be tough and is a must win if democrats want to not lose seats in the Senate."

Biden would have a carbon tax, which economists agree is more effective the regulation of emissions

Additionally we‚Äôd have a lot of investment in electric vehicles and a ban on non EV by 2030

We are gonna have to help Joe.  We are gonna have to work hard and pull this campaign over the Impeachment finish line.  We are gonna be the leaders, rather than following.

706,Biden is probably going to win the nomination. He is going to lose to Trump. The AZ debate might be too late to save Bernie but its going to be a harsh awaking for a lot of Democrats of what is to come. Please don't blame anybody Biden and his supporters when that happens.

Just like you gloss over the fact that your candidate has been in the senate, a position that arguably has more chance of getting legislation passed, for over 30 years, and yet has got nothing done. And the fact that your candidate so barely believed in the democratic system he didn't even vote until he could vote for himself. 

We don't dislike Sanders because his supporters are ""mean"", but because they actively tear down and harass other candidates and their supporters, spread lies, and act like non-supporters are evil and want people to die, while gloating and trying to pack . You don't see that with any other one of the candidates - our communities not only self-police, but our candidates don't talk in a way that demeans our opponents and encourages the sort of vitriol that gets directed at us from Sanders supporters"

In Syria , Assad is still the Least evil option amongst all other factions. Hence the reason why majority of people rallied around him (including the Sunnis) during the civil war, unlike Tunisia or Egypt where the majority immediately switched sides. The other alternate was a bunch of radical militants who vowed genocide on the ethnic and religious minorities if they acquire power. Given that context any neutral person can agree while Assad was a brutal tyrant, his alternative was even worse.

Coming to Modi, he is twice elected in a fair free democratic election in the worlds largest democracy. It is not for US to decide whom should Indians elect. And saying elected reps from US shouldn‚Äôt engage with one of the most influential countries in Asia is madness"

739,"Exactly. If you don't want to use PACs or dark money, that's a perfectly acceptable way to run a campaign. But this ""Dark money for me, not for thee"" is a position I can't support"
740,"If Biden HOPEFULLY goes down the Obama route in terms of mobilization, you'll likely be able to do phone banking from your own home.  Depending on your state, if it's one that's an automatic win for blue or red, you can even call into battleground states.

&amp;#x200B;

This is probably 4-5 months away though."
741,So Biden's website already has policies that answer all of Bernie's questions that he announced at his press conference today.   I'm not sure if Sanders is not aware of this or if he wants to give Joe an excuse to address them so he can bring Bernie's supporters on board.
742,"Fortunes change in politics quickly.  We have wrapped up the nomination when Biden takes the stage as the nominee at the convention.

Until then, we are working for every single primary vote, and after that every general election vote."

749,"What does the Public Option mean in healthcare? 

Is that like government based insurance rather than private?"
750,"You've really never looked into any of this and you are this ignorant of the facts or are you just disingenous? Seems like the latter.

It clearly states that we already spend 52 trillion as a country over the next 10 years and studies show it would actually save 5 trillion with the budget proposals, taxes will be higher but the net is lower for Americans and everyone is covered.

Are you just not really familiar with policy and why people need healthcare or are you disengenous? Talking to you is like talking to a trump voter."
751,"My biggest gripe is the cost, for insulin and epi pens. Why do we have to pay more than other counties?"
752,"I understand, it‚Äôs probably really frustrating, politics sucks. I actually really like Pete and supported him early on although I hadn‚Äôt truly decided on a candidate until last month. I don‚Äôt know where Pete will end up right now, but I‚Äôm almost certain Pete will get something big, but I just don‚Äôt see it being likely he‚Äôll get VP. To be honest, VP is a pretty loathed position anyways, but I understand its significance. Like I said though, Pete is super young (relatively), he‚Äôs only 9 years older than me and would have been the youngest president by a long shot. I honestly think he‚Äôll be able to have a more successful run the next time around."
753,Florida is the crazy hot state.
754,General election analysis is tough by winner take all nature and toss up states. Winning or losing any close toss up states decides the whole thing in the end and a lot of polls are within MOE come GE in swing states.
755,"Hey, quick question, why do y'all support Biden, Its just I still don't have a stand in the election and wanna know why I should support each candidate."
756,"I care less if we loose ultras who have no sense to compromise just because they do not get what they want. Personally I feel we are better off attracting/keeping centrist. We can learn from UK‚Äôs election, when party moves to one extreme appeasing one wing, centrist can leave in droves to the opposition."
757,Cus Bernie is getting raw pounded here
758,"This is not a very honest statement considering that Bernie Sanders did present an amendment to the DNC trying to get rid of superdelegates, which the DNC promptly refused. When people now say that Bernie Sanders supported superdelegates in 2016 they mean the compromised that was reached with the DNC to have some superdelegates tied to the primaries result, but they always fail to bring up the original amendment itself."
759,"Most states have either sore-loser laws or simultaneous registration dates for the primary and the general election to prevent primary challengers to run as third party or independent in the general election. Only Connecticut, Iowa, New York, and Vermont don't have either and only Iowa can be considered as battleground state."
760,"Except his policies are terrible, and his lifetime of dedicated public service has amounted to barely anything."
761,"Body language is very telling right now....

Biden: cool and confident

Bernie: twitchy and nervous"
762," FELLOW DEMOCRATS AND OTHER CONSCIENTIOUS VOTERS, PLEASE READ:  If it turns out to be Biden (or any Dem that‚Äôs not your ideal candidate) ‚Äî as disappointed as many of us would be ‚Äî please remember:  1. You're not just voting for President. 2. You're voting for who replaces RBG on the Supreme Court. 3. You're voting for the next Secretary of Education. 4. You're voting for federal judges. 5. You're voting for the rule of law. 6. You're voting for saving national parks. 7. You're voting for letting kids out of cages. 8. You're voting for clean air and clean water. 9. You're voting for scientists to be allowed to speak about climate change. 10. You're voting for what a President says and does on Twitter. 11. You're voting for housing rights. 12. You're voting for LGBTQ people to be treated with dignity. 13. You're voting for non-Christians to be able to adopt and to feel like full citizens. 14. You're voting for Dreamers. 15.

You're voting so that someone else can have health insurance. 19. You're voting for the preservation of PBS. 20.

No Democrat is perfect. Your first AND second choices may have dropped out. Your third might. But the nominee, no matter who she or he is, won't be perfect. They won't pass your purity test. And yet every single one of them will be better than four more years of Trump!!!"
763,It is absolutely true. https://apnews.com/ca32b175f2d249e5075bb057afa4748e
764,"Yeah, I definitely didn‚Äôt mean that as in the longer she waits the less she matters. Just that the longer she waits, the less her endorsement matters for *support migration* since people are already picking camps now"
765,"People who earned less than $2,500 in 2018 get $0. So if you were a student or unemployed in 2018 and didn't pay taxes, you will get nothing now. Literally zero for the poorest people. 

One estimate that I saw said 22 million people will get zero and they are mostly poor and young people who work retail or unemployed people."
766,"Bernie kinda highlighted the reason I went for Biden over him. He is right that I support his policies, but over the last year of gone from having no opinion on Bernie as a person, to having a strong dislike for him. Add that Biden has adapted to the party going left and that's why I'm here.

Also is Bernie basically saying that if the older generation fell in line with him he would be in good shape? Isn't that just the opposite of saying the younger generation should fall in line with Biden?

This while speech is precisely why I don't like Bernie and can't possibly see him winning over independents and center right people when he can't even appeal to moderate Democrats.

Edit: I'm starting to think that Bernie is trying to give Biden a chance to appeal to his base before he drops out. I don't think those questions were trying to say ""you won't do anything about these problems"" but instead ""please reassure my supporters on how you will address the things they care most about"""
767,"I beg to disagree.  Look at the stock market, health insurance stock jumped 10% the Wednesday following Super Tuesday.  Number one cause of bankruptcy in America is ‚Äúinsured‚Äù people.  The majority wants it.  Call it progressive or what u want.  Also, Bernie is not my guy, but he does have me interested.  Also, elections are decided by a slim margin, like 1 to 3%  of the vote.  So like it or not, the Democratic Party will have to give into the people‚Äôs will if they want to ‚Äúwin‚Äù.  God willing me and millions more will stand our ground and force democrats to change their lying shitty ways."
768,Checking off demographic boxes is a fool's errand. McCain picked Palin to drive a wedge on gender and look how poorly it turned out for him.
769,"^ ^ ^ THIS ^ ^ ^ THIS RIGHT HERE. Bernie is too high on his horse to even get enough support for his legislation from Democrats, he‚Äôd never be able to compromise enough to actually get a bill that would make it to his desk"
770,"On the flip side, Bernie is promising so many unrealistically hard to pass policies that I feel like most of what he says is going to be unfulfilled campaign promises. The things Biden is proposing have a real shot at getting passed."
771,"You know what's exciting?

Joe Biden's campaigning on a platform of being willing to use whatever foreign affairs trick he has to to force Russia to stop \*murdering\* gay kids. To stop Saudi Arabia from \*murdering\* gay kids. He's not just going to sit in the white house and write a strongly worded letter saying that killing gay kids is bad and should stop.

This is just one small fraction of his LGBT plan, just the Global implementation.

**ADVANCE GLOBAL LGBTQ+ RIGHTS AND DEVELOPMENT:**

&gt;**Ensure that human rights are at the center of our engagement with the world.** Biden will significantly bolster the offices at the State Department and USAID dedicated to promoting global LGBTQ+ rights and development. He will appoint senior leaders across the government who will champion global equality, including a point person for LGBTQ+ rights on the National Security Council to drive a cohesive message and strategy across our engagement with individual countries and regions. Biden will immediately appoint a Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTQ+ Persons at the Department of State to coordinate diplomatic efforts and combat homophobia, transphobia, and stigma globally. He will also appoint a Special Coordinator in charge of international LGBTQ+ programming at USAID.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Advance an inclusive human rights agenda that promotes LGBTQ+ rights by integrating them within a broad human rights agenda.** A Biden Administration will advance the inherent human rights of all people, irrespective of who they love or how they identify, rather than siloing off LGBTQ+ human rights as something separate or distinct. It will seek to advance the rights of transgender and intersex people, who face particularly extreme marginalization and bias at home and abroad.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Use the full range of our diplomatic tools and foreign assistance to protect and advance human rights and development, and actively combat violence and  discrimination.** Biden will lead a coalition of like-minded governments and international organizations to advance protections for LGBTQ+ people, fight for decriminalization of LGBTQ+ identities and relationships, and respond swiftly and meaningfully to threats to LGBTQ+ rights or safety globally. When governments move to restrict LGBTQ+ rights, fail to enforce legal protections in place, or allow or foster a climate of intolerance, the Biden Administration, working with partners, will pursue the most effective strategy to influence that government‚Äôs behavior, including private diplomacy, public statements, multilateral initiatives at United Nations agencies, and concrete, direct pressure. The Biden Administration will aggressively use pressure tactics, as appropriate, including sanctions (such as Global Magnitsky sanctions and visa bans) to respond to violations  of human rights, including LGBTQ+ rights.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Combat sexual orientation and gender identity biases.** Changing underlying attitudes and prejudices around LGBTQ+ issues is critical to achieving long-term, sustainable impacts and reducing violence and discrimination against LGBTQ+ communities. A Biden Administration will seek to advance culturally appropriate public information campaigns to promote LGBTQ+ human rights and reduce biases, working in partnership with and building on the success and best practices of programs like the [UN Free &amp; Equal](https://www.unfe.org/) campaign. Such efforts will support and collaborate with local movements and organizations that are advancing this agenda in their own countries, and work to elevate local voices, examples, and role models.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Stand with local civil society**. Under a Biden Administration, foreign assistance from USAID and the State Department will prioritize strengthening the voice, capacity, and agency of local LGBTQ+ organizations and activists. These groups are on the frontlines of the movement to advance the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals around the world, and they are essential partners. This is critical to progress and to the safety of those working in the movement on the ground. The Obama-Biden Administration established an array of programs that directly supported local LGBTQ+ civil society groups around the world. As President, Biden will build on that record of support.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Evaluate programming to ensure that investments are reaching the intended population and making a difference.** The Biden Administration will place special emphasis on reaching and serving LGBTQ+ individuals in its diplomatic and development support efforts. For example, development assistance will be screened and evaluated to ensure it is helping elevate the economic and social status of LGBTQ+ communities. Similarly, PEPFAR programming will continue to engage with LGBTQ+ communities on anti-stigma programs and countering violence and discrimination so that LGBTQ+ individuals are able to access the health care they need without fearing for their own personal safety and security.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Work with Congress to enact legislation ‚Äì like the** [**GLOBE Act**](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3874/text) currently before the House‚Äîwhich will permanently make upholding LGBTQ+ rights a priority of the foreign policy of the United States, including addressing discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ individuals."
772,They are all trying to not be a influencer but its very obvious Bernie is a ton of trouble. He is going to lose MI and maybe WA then he is toast.
773,"It was in response to a cartoon of Bernie and Trump arguing, leading to them kiss.  I said I loled and mentioned the pic that got me banned.  The irony of what's permissible..."
774,"Say hello to Mx. Vice President, Bepekaco Warbookloyaberg!"
775,What's about Joe Biden‚Äôs outright lies? Are you going to ignore that?
776,the fuck did i just read
777,"Sorry but even with this it takes nothing away from the countless lies and fabrications, also plenty of evidence for constant confusion.

Weird how suddenly there isn‚Äôt going to be a one on one debate, just a town hall. I imagine the questions will be full of fluff for Biden yet knives will be out for the other candidate.

Let‚Äôs have a proper debate, or are people scared?

You are literally going to hand another 4 years to Trump at this rate."
778,And the plurality prediction is basically a tossup.
779,At least we vote. LOL
780,Shows you how he‚Äôd be as President.
781,"Bernie stands for anger and hate 

He has been preaching revolution for 40 years 

Russia gave him a megaphone"
782,Biden will almost certainly do 4 and then pass over to endorsing whoever his VP was ‚Äî which makes it very important for him to pick a VP who can actually win an election and serve as President on their own right.
783,"We need to be building towards unity, not trolling.  This isn't the place and the time."
784,"Compared that to VP Biden, and Sanders is just a fingerwagging scold.

Face it, BS is going to go back to the Senate and retire at the end of his term at age 84."
785,"There's a decent chance the concern trolling is from folks falsely claiming to be Pete, Amy, or Tom supporters."
786,Good to know there are other foreigners here that are way too involved in American politics as well
787,"Michelle's out, she doesn't want it. 

Abrams is too inexperienced. 

Yates...maybe? I don't think it's a terrible pick but I don't think it helps Biden a ton either. 

Duckworth is probably my favorite candidate of the bunch. 

Gillibrand is okay I guess. 

Klobuchar is definitely very competent but I don't think she gets the call. She strikes me as being stronger in the Senate than as VP. Keep her effective legislative work there. 

Warren could bring over some of the farther left faction of the Democrats but she's quite old when the consensus seems to be leaning towards a younger person to contrast against Biden. 

Harris I think is the safe choice. 

If Baldwin wasn't from a state that has a decent chance of going red in the Senate I think she'd be much higher on the list.

Cortez Masto has a good shot, I think."
788,"I've been riding the Biden train for a while now. Even when he was a nobody. Here's a few reasons why:  


1: Ending this vitriolic political wars. Politics are important, of that there is no doubt but I don't want it to become apart of literally everything in life. Its especially become toxic as of late, with people like Trump doing whatever he wants, whenever he wants.   


Biden has a cool head and wants to bring people together. Yeah I don't see eye to eye with the Pubs, frankly I disagree on many stances but I know it's better to work together than to be enemies. Even if it means only working together on a moderate amount of things.  


2: Biden is a good man. Good vice president with Obama, good senator from Delaware. Overall he has a nice track record, much like most of the democratic candidates. Unlike the other candidates he has actual experience in the Whitehouse, which I think gives him an edge.   


3: Biden wants to stop hostile Russian resurgence. Russian government is bad, and its people are forced to live under someone who is basically a dictator. Stopping him is the goal, be it political or economic.   


4: He's more progressive than you think. Biden advertises himself as a centrist but when you really look into the nitty gritty he fits right into the same cookie Obama was cut from. The only difference is Biden would be a stronger leader when it comes to our global adversaries as his foreign policy is more proactive.    


5: I know he can actually run the nation after winning. The President is only one section of the US, there is also Congress. If you do not have Congress you will be stepped all over as president. As stated before, Biden advertises himself in the center, meaning he would attract more beyond a very progressive base, obviously meaning more votes. Also, if Biden is elected the House of Representatives would remain Democratic as he would not energize republican voters into action out of fear, and from there a likely long awaited reclaiming of the Senate would occur. Giving the Democrats the trifecta. President, House and Senate."
789,"Unfortunately, there are only three primaries tonight (Ohio‚Äôs got postponed üòë) but I agree with you. Also as more primaries postpone I hope that a) states will instead move to all mail-in-ballots as it‚Äôs not a given that in person voting in June will even happen and/or b) Bernie will drop out because dragging this race on isn‚Äôt helping anyone."
790,"U see that‚Äôs the problem Biden does do good with African Americans that vote BUT so did Hillary here‚Äôs the problem Hillary won the black vote by 92% in general but African American turnout was down a lot in crucial states like Michigan,Wisconsin and Pennsylvania sooo having a likeable African American like Harris would increase TO leading to a win."
791,Welcome!
792,"Pete supporter here too. I accidentally voted for Pete at first using paper ballots, had to go back and ask for another ballot. Sucks we can't vote for our guy, but it's for the good of the country. And he will have a big role to play in the future!"
793,"Now is the time to build bridges, not burn them. Many many people voted for Bernie, be respectful of that."
794,Beto will run
795,*Broward County fidgets nervously*
796,I was actually referring to MGTOW since you two seemed to be going back and forth a bit. Sorry if that was unclear.
797,r politics removed the debate thread
798,"they‚Äôre so triggered that she hasn‚Äôt endorsed him. Let the woman do what she wants, some of them act like she‚Äôs obligated to endorse him"
799,"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/minnesota/

Amy was high in recent polls. Hopefully her numbers go to Joe...


Also with both Amy and Pete dropping out, people will start to realize that this is a 2 person race and shift their votes accordingly... 

it will be close, but I think Joe picks up Minn on Tuesday."
800,"no I've just embraced a continuation the way I survived Scott as governer: ""I don't know what you're talking about, Florida doesn't *have* ~~a governor~~ ~~senators~~ a governor or senators, I've never seen this man before in my life, stop spouting nonsense."""
801,You‚Äôre right on all counts. I‚Äôll take a win for rational thought in the Oval Office. Absolutely. I‚Äôm still swinging for the fences tho. At least until the convention.
802,Can't blame the Russians in this scenario when it's American bernie bros at it again.

The video of Obama saying it is him talking at a town hall, its not like hes making inroads with Castro at that given minute. Obama could have chosen not to say it at that town hall. He told a whole fucking story about it lol.

Bernie can't saying when directly asked about it by an interviewer? What is Bernie is also trying to forge a connection with a foreign leader lol. His motivations could be identical for all you know.

So we started at: Obama didn't say it.

To: Obama is allowed to say it because he was trying to make inroads with the person THAT IS SO TERRIBLE WE ARENT ALLOWED TO SAY IT.

You are absolutely 100% ridiculous and I can't believe you are sticking to this argument. Fine, hate on Bernie because of the context. Biden still lied when he said Obama didn't say that, during the debate. So we agree Biden lied? 

This is literally the most ridiculous thing ive heard, I honestly can't believe you are sticking to it.



&gt;I disagree with both of them on this, but they are clearly 2 different situations.

808,"I think Bernie is holding out for tomorrow's debate.

Where he will attempt to convince Biden on live TV, to adopt some elements of his policies.

Then after the Tuesday states, he will dropout and endorse Biden. And can better convince his Berners to support Biden if Biden adopts some of elements of his policies. (Emphasis on ""elements"", and not the policies themselves. E.g. the universal aspect of M4A, but not the whole M4A and its Bernie proposed funding mechanism.)"

811,"I‚Äôm heading to bed but thank you for welcoming this Warren supporter to your subreddit. Most likely, Biden will be the nominee and I look forward to supporting him. I may even try to volunteer in some way to ensure Sanders loses. I‚Äôm an idealist at heart and Obama was my first President so I‚Äôve always been fond of Biden. A lot of people forget his story but I don‚Äôt. Biden is the guy who took the subway to work each day, Biden was once the youngest congressman in history, Biden‚Äôs sons final wish was for him to run for President and he didn‚Äôt have the strength to do it in 2016 but he is going to win this now. Biden‚Äôs not running for himself. Unlike Bernie, who has gotten caught up in his own ego. Biden is running to be President because he believes he is the strongest candidate to beat Trump. I‚Äôd love more progressive agendas to take hold in this country but that fight is only going to be won in congress. What Bernie folks don‚Äôt get is that there actually should be a limit on a Presidents power and a lot of the change they want should be fought for in congress. Biden is a man if decency and integrity. Bernie preaches a $15 minimum wage but as it‚Äôs been reported on, he didn‚Äôt even pay his staff $15 an hour until they held an internal protest. Biden‚Äôs greatest weakness is his gaffes, but that‚Äôs just attributed yo stuttering, a condition he can‚Äôt control and shouldn‚Äôt be made fun of. Biden is a smart guy. He makes friends in congress, not because he‚Äôs a sell out but because he knows that‚Äôs how change actually happens. You can‚Äôt change the system unless you know how to work the system. Trump has set us back significantly. Read the Fifth Risk and learn how Trump has decimated so many governmental agencies. We need someone with experience to reverse all the damage Trump has done to this country. Warren inspired me to be a better person and Biden inspires me to do the same."

Dark money groups like Our Revoltion can literally pay agitators, mods, whoever and we'd know nothing about it because of the Citizens United ruling they're exploiting. There's also been a lot of mod turnover resulting in homogeneous views from the plurality of mods. 



I really wish reddit would just turn that into a sanders sub and create a new political default. Many of rhe alternatives that currently exist are boring or dead, so you have to go to specific candidates subreddits or something like r/neoliberal to have actually intriguing engagements."

But please go back to the shallow depths of hell where you existed before creating this account with 11 karma.
830,"Glad we could assist, let's do this"
831,"For those paywalled:

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and his supporters can whine all they like about the ‚ÄúDemocratic establishment.‚Äù They can insist that they have the ‚Äúgrass roots‚Äù behind the Sanders campaign and that former vice president Joe Biden is a creature of the billionaire class. However, when you are overwhelmingly behind in the polls, both national and state, it might be time to stop making excuses and start recognizing that the vast majority of the Democratic primary electorate wants someone else as the nominee.

What a difference South Carolina and Super Tuesday can make. Biden is now crushing Sanders. In the latest CNN poll, taken after Super Tuesday, Biden leads Sanders 52 percent to 36 percent nationally among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. By a 65 percent to 26 percent margin these voters believe Biden is best able to unify the country and by a nearly identical margin think he is best able to beat President Trump.

Biden‚Äôs favorability among all voters is now in positive territory (48 percent to 44 percent) in contrast to both Trump (43/54) and Sanders (42/52). Biden leads Trump by a 53 to 43 percent margin in a head-to-head contest, Sanders by seven points (52 to 45 percent). Key, however, is the margin in battleground states: ‚ÄúAmong those voters who live in 15 battleground states ‚Äî those decided by 8 points or less in the 2016 election ‚Äî Biden narrowly tops Trump, 51% to 45%, while Sanders and Trump are within the margin of error of each other, 49% back Sanders, 46% Trump.‚Äù Meanwhile, Democrats have a nine-point lead in the generic congressional poll (53-44).

Looking at the breakdown of support for the remaining primary contenders, Biden leads overwhelmingly among Democrats (55 percent to 32 percent) while they are virtually tied among Democratic-leaning independents. Biden leads by a wide margin among both college and non-college graduates and even more (58 percent to 30 percent) among non-college-educated, nonwhite voters. If anyone has a claim to a diverse cross-section of working-class voters, it is Biden, not Sanders.

In Tuesday‚Äôs Michigan primary, Biden has a double-digit lead over Sanders, 51 percent to 27 percent in the Detroit Free Press poll released on Monday. While Sanders trailed in polling by a wide margin in 2016 but eked out an upset over Hillary Clinton, the terrain looks considerably worse for him. ‚ÄúLooked at as two blocs ‚Äî those under the age of 50 and those over ‚Äî Sanders wins the younger bloc, 43%-33% with 15% undecided. Biden wins the older group 65%-14% with 11% undecided,‚Äù the pollsters report. ‚ÄúThe older group, according to the poll, makes up 56% of the electorate, while the younger group makes up 44%.‚Äù

Sanders will need a surge of younger voters to draw close to Biden. However, as in Super Tuesday states, late-deciding voters favor Biden (‚Äúamong the 37% of respondents who decided in the last few days, Biden led overwhelmingly, 75%-18%, over Sanders‚Äù). It seems that at least in Michigan, the primary electorate has decided en masse that electability matters more than the candidates‚Äô stance on issues (57 to 34 percent) and among that 57 percent, Biden takes 61 percent.

Should Biden win in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi on Tuesday, he will have confirmed how decisively the race shifted on Super Tuesday. The endorsements of former rivals (e.g. Pete Buttigieg; Sens. Kamala D. Harris, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar; Beto O‚ÄôRourke) parallel the consolidation of support for Biden. Democrats seem ready to put the primary contest behind them and get on to the business of beating Trump. At some point, it would behoove Sanders to realize that ‚Äúreal‚Äù Democrats, working-class Democrats and a diverse cross-section of Democrats do not support him."

837,"Obama/Biden saved the Auto industry AND used the opportunity to demand the industry develop fuel efficient and electric cars with efficiency standards that increased over time. Amazon just ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans. Harley is launching an electric bike. Hummer is coming back with an electric version. Ford is about to drop an electric F-150.

Obama/Biden did more for climate than any admin. They also took 850,000 gas guzzlers off the road with cash for clunkers. Used stimulus funds to invest in hundreds of renewable energy companies and ended up causing China to invest huge on solar to compete with the US.

So wave your green new deal, criticize pragmatism, but climate change will need  actual results. Renewables now outpace coal power. That‚Äôs progress. Let‚Äôs keep going"

841,"Of course not. A debate against trump isn‚Äôt about substance or policy, it‚Äôs about poking jabs at the administration and being charismatic, things Biden still excels at. 

A debate against Bernie would literally come down to Trump calling him a communist until Bernie gets red in the face. I don‚Äôt think you realize how hard it would to convince Americans who lived through the Cold War and Red Scare to vote for a socialist. It would be a massacre."
842,"Yeah its pretty impressive, like in some state the turnout was double digits up from last year especially in virginia and my home state North Carolina. I agree, i love Bernie but I've already signed up for text and phone banking today. I'm gonna do whatever it takesbto get Trump out."

He‚Äôs the only voice left that address the true dangers of climate change, our healthcare system, and other social issues that Biden isn‚Äôt touching or doing anywhere near enough to address them. Even though Biden keeps winning states by large margins, there‚Äôs still a huge generational gap and it‚Äôs not changing in favor of Biden.

863,"As much as i love Bernie, his style of debate had never changed; from Hillary through Ted Cruz to 2020 with all the candidates and finally 1 on 1 with Biden, his style is to listen to his opponent and respond with a fixed set of points. His points are not incorrect by any means, but that is really what he does when you analyze all of his debate performances. In the wealthiest country in the history of this world, how is is that we have millions of people without health issurance? These are not radical ideas. Let us join the rest of civilized world in providing healthcare for all as a right and not a privilege. 

For every single political issue he has this fixed set of points that he had repeated for years in every interview and debate. Is he wrong because of this? No, his points remain factual and 90% of times he is right. But that will not matter against Trump, it wont work. 

How do i know?

Watch Hillary vs Trump, all of the debates. What Hillary does is what Bernie does, although she obviously doesnt use his talking points, she ignores personal attacks and constantly stays on the issues, repeating what will be the best for the country and why her opponents ideas are worse. Was she wrong? No, just like Bernie isnt. But it didnt work, and it wouldnt work this time. 

Joe will of course also keep it classy and stay on the issues, but his style is much more flexible. The prime example is obviously against Paul Ryan - this style of debating would absolutely destroy Trump. And he didn't lost it with age at all - we can see his style once again in he most recent debate. Joe does not compromise substance, he keeps talking about whats important, but his response to his opponents attacks is what makes him more effective in a debate against Trump than anyone else. I can already see him laughing at Trumps nonsense and calling it out immediately, based on facts. Just like with Ryan. And even if you say ""well, that was almost 10 years ago"", a counter-argument can be made - Trump is no Paul Ryan. If Joe's performance of 2012 was sufficient to destroy a person that actually knew what he was talking about and had some standards, he will only need a part of this effort to win against someone.... Well, someone like Trump."

873,"True, but I feel like his fracking comments are going to put off voters there, and many many people will be drawn to Trump after he does the UBI thing and givees them 3000 dollars for a family. Wisconsin isn't as important, since if we loose pennsylvania, we loose the election (unless we win florida), but Arizona can substitute for wisconsin quite easily. It's going to come down to the wire, tbh."
874,Yes! That would probably be the worst strategy. It must be organic and Biden actually has to do some outreach.

878,"I'm going to try to speculate reasons why he would continue to stay in. 

1) He hopes that COVID-19 somehow prevents older voters from turning out in the remaining states, allowing for the younger voters who vote for him to outnumber them. (obviously this was proven wrong with yesterday's results).  

2) Something health-wise will happen to Biden before the convention. (IMO, this is the worst thing to base his reasoning on from a moral standpoint)

3) He wants more bargaining power at the convention (Unlikely, as staying in after he has little to no chance probably wouldn't give him as much negotiating power as he thinks. Also, he has already moved the part to the left). 
  
4) He wants to continue collecting peoples' donations."

882,"Pete dropped before Amy, prompting her to drop out. So no."
883,"There are certain factors that can influence that outcome. However, striving to reach out to nonvoters and independents through an assessment of how lives change under a Biden presidency will go a long way with this demographic. It's time to stop with the ""return to normalcy"", because for many Americans normalcy wasn't a positive. However, Biden is demonstrating several policies which can actually help working people. The issue in terms of enthusiasm becomes how many people don't know about that as a possibility."

888,"Okay, you are also referencing a bunch of videos about Biden that Bernie made, which are mostly doctored and some of them show him stuttering. 

I feel like the Biden and Warren supporters and others on here have explained to Bernie supporters at length that it's not okay to make hateful statements and that you just keep doing it. I myself have explained that racism is bad and sexism is bad and discrimination against people with disabilities is bad at least 25 times a day to Bernie supporters and you guys just keep doing it. I don't think understanding that discrimination is bad is that hard. Just don't assume that people who are different than you are inferior and you will have an easier time of it."

For someone that has more than one rifle, which is a whole lot of people, we are talking about thousands and thousands to maintain items they already had a background check per the Brady Bill and already paid tax on.

A fucking 223 from an Ar15 is the exact same as a 223 from a Mini 14 but chances are nobody will go after the 14 because it isn't scary looking. If I want to use a cheap and reliable rifle for home defense, why is that a problem? Last time I checked my guns didn't sneak out of the house and kill anyone on their own. 

And maybe you missed the part where it's turn in your gun or get put on a registry. After the shit with CCW holder getting their info leaked I don't want that

898,"&gt; I don't want subsequent debates to be fuel for republican attacks

This is my issue and why I'm so frustrated that Bernie is staying in. Neither Biden nor Bernie were top choices of mine initially, but we need to get Trump out of office, and the longer the primary is dragged out and the more the leading candidate (now Biden) faces attacks from other Democrats, the more it will weaken him in the general election. I get that this situation is frustrating for people who dislike both Trump and Biden, but people need to act like adults and realize that their favorite candidates don't always win and sometimes they just have to vote for the less bad option. Bernie is putting his ego ahead of the greater good at this point and it needs to stop."

There is a reason Trump, the GOP, and Russia keep pushing Bernie.  Biden appeals to the exact demographics that will hurt them most. 
 If Bernie wins, they have an easier candidate to beat.  If they aren't successful, at least they hammer that divisive wedge in the party.  Win-win.  

That's also why Trump got impeached trying to manufacture dirt on Biden.  The ""Biden is the most electable"" narrative existed (and exists) for a reason."

Bernie people called Pete a rat, Warren a snake, and Kamala a racist cop. Now you might say we are biased against Bernie. I was a Peter supporter Pete was my guy, Pete and Kolobuchar hated each other pretty openly yet her supporters never attacked Pete the way Bernie's did. Ask the supporters of any candidate and they'll tell you Bernie's people were way different then the others.

952,"A public option is a good middle ground and likely the best we can hope for for now, I‚Äôm not against going that route.  

The areas where having universal single payer would be superior are:  no more worrying about in and out of network (not everywhere accepts Medicare right now for example) as everyone would be covered everywhere, with one insurer covering everyone the government could set reimbursement rates to control costs and mandate all facilities accept them as payment in full (and to be fair to providers and facilities ideally there would be a elected board of medical professionals setting the rates to be fair to both providers and the taxpayers), and it would save quite a bit on overhead when it comes to medical billing, collections, etc.  

I could see a role for private insurance still existing in such a system as additional rider plans - for example having additional coverage that would allow you to upgrade to a private room at a hospital or cover vanity cosmetic procedures."
953,"I would agree.  For what its worth, I apologize if it felt like I was misrepresenting or misunderstanding what you said.  It was not my intention.  Rather, the part of your statement that I took exception to was the implication that Obama is to blame for that failure to deliver and moreso that it is reason to distrust the political establishment.  I believe that the effort he made to enact those policies is admirable. 

Sanders has been in congress for nearly 30 years and has pushed for a lot of reform.  Nonetheless, he has not accomplished many of the goals he set and yet I do not believe this lessens his character by any degree.  On the contrary, I believe he is a noble man with noble goals, even if I don't agree on his approach to said goals."

960,"He was addressing blue collar workers at the time. Immediately responding, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre full of sh*t‚Äù reflected that. He‚Äôs not going to respond to every situation like that; he was trying to appeal to them. 

That being said, I think he took it too far, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt work for a certain electorate.


Edit: It looks like it wasn‚Äôt received poorly. I just found the worker‚Äôs response in the comments below:

""In this day and age, it's a language. I'm not going to hate him for that, and I use it all the time,"" Wayne said. ""Most people use it all the time, and I don't think that's something to beat the guy up about. But he could have curved what he said a little bit, sure."""

972,"&lt;Shrug&gt; Ok.

   * Elected by the state of Vermont 8 times to serve in the House of Representatives.

   * The longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history.

   * He was dubbed the ‚Äúamendment king‚Äù in the House of Representatives for passing more amendments than any other member of Congress.

   * Ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee.

   * Former student organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).

   * Led the first ever civil rights sit-in in Chicago history to protest segregated housing.

    * Former professor of political science at Harvard University‚Äôs Kennedy School of Government and at Hamilton College.

    * Former mayor of Burlington, VT. In a stunning upset in 1981, Sanders won the mayoral race in Burlington, Vermont‚Äôs largest city. He shocked the city‚Äôs political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. Burlington is now reported to be one of the most livable cities in the nation.

    * Co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus and chaired the group for its first 8 years.

    * Both the NAACP and the NHLA (National Hispanic Leadership Agenda) have given Sanders 100% voting scores during his tenure in the Senate. Earns a D- from the NRA.

    * 1984: Mayor Sanders established the Burlington Community Land Trust, the first municipal housing land-trust in the country for affordable housing. The project becomes a model emulated throughout the world. It later wins an award from Jack Kemp-led HUD.

    * 1991: one of a handful in Congress to vote against authorizing US military force in Iraq. ‚ÄúI have a real fear that the region is not going to be more peaceful or more stable after the war,‚Äù he said at the time.

    * 1992: Congress passes Sanders‚Äô first signed piece of legislation to create the National Program of Cancer Registries. A Reader‚Äôs Digest article calls the law ‚Äúthe cancer weapon America needs most.‚Äù All 50 states now run registries to help cancer researchers gain important insights.

    * November 1993: Sanders votes against the Clinton-era North American Free Trade Agreement. Returning from a tour of factories in Mexico, Sanders says: ‚ÄúIf NAFTA passes, corporate profits will soar because it will be even easier than now for American companies to flee to Mexico and hire workers there for starvation wages.‚Äù

    * July 1996: Sanders is one of only 67 (out of 435, 15%) votes against the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal benefits to same-sex couples legally married. Sanders urged the Supreme Court to throw out the law, which it did in a landmark 2013 ruling ‚Äì some 17 years later.

    * July 1999: Standing up against the major pharmaceutical companies, Sanders becomes the first member of Congress to personally take seniors across the border to Canada to buy lower-cost prescription drugs. The congressman continues his bus trips to Canada with a group of breast cancer patients the following April. These brave women are able to purchase their medications in Canada for almost one-tenth the price charged in the States.

   * August 1999: An overflow crowd of Vermonters packs a St. Michael‚Äôs College town hall meeting hosted by Sanders to protest an IBM plan to cut older workers‚Äô pensions by as much as 50 percent. CBS Evening News with Dan Rather and The New York Times cover the event. After IBM enacts the plan, Sanders works to reverse the cuts, passing a pair of amendments to prohibit the federal government from acting to overturn a federal district court decision that ruled that IBM‚Äôs plan violated pension age discrimination laws. Thanks to Sanders‚Äô efforts, IBM agreed to a $320 million legal settlement with some 130,000 IBM workers and retirees.

   * November 1999: About 10 years before the 2008 Wall Street crash spins the world economy into a massive recession, Sanders votes ‚Äúno‚Äù on a bill to undo decades of financial regulations enacted after the Great Depression. ‚ÄúThis legislation,‚Äù he predicts at the time, ‚Äúwill lead to fewer banks and financial service providers, increased charges and fees for individual consumers and small businesses, diminished credit for rural America and taxpayer exposure to potential losses should a financial conglomerate fail. It will lead to more mega-mergers, a small number of corporations dominating the financial service industry and further concentration of power in our country.‚Äù The House passed the bill 362-57 over Sanders‚Äô objection.

    * October 2001: Sanders votes against the USA Patriot Act. ‚ÄúAll of us want to protect the American people from terrorist attacks, but in a way that does not undermine basic freedoms,‚Äù Sanders says at the time. He subsequently votes against reauthorizing the law in 2006 and 2011.

    * October 2002: Sanders votes against the Bush-Cheney war in Iraq. He warns at the time that an invasion could ‚Äúresult in anti-Americanism, instability and more terrorism.‚Äù Hillary Clinton votes in favor of it.

    * November 2006: Sanders defeats Vermont‚Äôs richest man, Rich Tarrant, to be elected to the U.S. Senate. Sanders, running as an Independent, is endorsed by the Vermont Democratic Party and supported by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

    * December 2007: Sanders‚Äô authored energy efficiency and conservation grant program passes into law. He later secures $3.2 billion in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for the grant program.

   * September 2008: Thanks to Sanders‚Äô efforts, funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funding doubles, helping millions of low-income Americans heat their homes in winter.

   * February 2009: Sanders works with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley to pass an amendment to an economic recovery bill preventing Wall Street banks that take taxpayer bailouts from replacing laid-off U.S. workers with exploited and poorly-paid foreign workers.

   * December 2009: Sanders passes language in the Affordable Care Act to allow states to apply for waivers to implement pilot health care systems by 2017. The legislation allows states to adopt more comprehensive systems to cover more people at lower costs.

   * March 2010: President Barack Obama signs into law the Affordable Care Act with a major Sanders provision to expand federally qualified community health centers. Sanders secures $12.5 billion in funding for the program which now serves more than 25 million Americans. Another $1.5 billion from a Sanders provision went to the National Health Service Corps for scholarships and loan repayment for doctors and nurses who practice in under-served communities.
  
 * July 2010: Sanders works with Republican Congressman Ron Paul in the House to pass a measure as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill to audit the Federal Reserve, revealing how the independent agency gave $16 trillion in near zero-interest loans to big banks and businesses after the 2008 economic collapse.

   * March 2013: Sanders, now chairman of the Senate Veterans‚Äô Affairs Committee, and backed by seniors, women, veterans, labor unions and disabled Americans, leads a successful effort to stop a ‚Äúchained-CPI‚Äù proposal supported by Congressional Republicans and the Administration to cut Social Security and disabled veterans‚Äô benefits.

   * April 2013: Sanders introduces legislation to break up major Wall Street banks so large that the collapse of one could send the overall economy into a downward spiral.

   * August 2014: A bipartisan $16.5 billion veterans bill written by Sen. Sanders, Sen. John McCain and Rep. Jeff Miller is signed into law by President Barack Obama. The measure includes $5 billion for the VA to hire more doctors and health professionals to meet growing demand for care.

   * January 2015: Sanders takes over as ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, using the platform to fight for his economic agenda for the American middle class.

   * January 2015: Sanders votes against the Keystone XL pipeline, which would allow multinational corporation TransCanada to transport dirty tar sands oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.

   * March 2015: Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) introduced legislation to expand benefits and strengthen the retirement program for generations to come. The Social Security Expansion Act was filed on the same day Sanders and other senators received the petitions signed by 2 million Americans, gathered by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.

   * September 2015: Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Rep. Ra√∫l M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-Ill.) today introduced bills to ban private prisons, reinstate the federal parole system and eliminate quotas for the number of immigrants held in detention.
  
*  January 2016: Sanders Places Hold on FDA Nominee Dr. Robert Califf because of his close ties to the pharmaceutical industry and lack of commitment to lowering drug prices. There is no reason to believe that he would make the FDA work for ordinary Americans, rather than just the CEOs of pharmaceutical companies.


Your turn."
973,Seconding that

975,this was *almost* malarkey.... you're on my watchlist
976,"She had been the presumptive nominee for awhile, but that really wasn‚Äôt the fault of the media or the DNC. Remember, only 5 people jumped in the race and 2 of them were gone before Iowa and the 3rd one got out the day after Iowa."

981,Andrew Gillum is awesome. Our Irish laddy will do great in Florida on St Patrick‚Äôs Day.
982,"Depends what you consider Universal Healthcare. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, what he‚Äôs proposing is pretty similar to what most European countries have, which people seem to think is pretty universal."
983,"Biden's health care plan is that if you are 138% below the poverty line you are automatically enrolled in a medicare like programme. 
You can also buy in to the programme, or if you have private insurance you can keep it. Middle class families qualify for premium tax credit which is supposed to save $750 a month in their coverage and if you find a plan that is cheaper then you can enroll. 

The Biden plan also stops surprise billing, and allows for leverage in negotiating with drug manufacturers over the price of prescription medication which they are exempt from at the moment. 

Healthcare is such a complex topic, there's so many different facets to it, it is hard to condense it. I know there's a lot more to cover. 

Disease like cancer is terrifying to me, I can't really imagine what it's like to get that diagnosis and then have to wonder how you can pay off the debt, especially if you have children. 

I will try and tackle a little bit about the investments in renewable energy and agricultural practices later, hopefully I remember. I'll edit my post to include it."

E.g. if he dropped out immediately after Super Tuesday that would absolutely have left it open for one of his surrogates to take the mantle in 2024 , saying that Bernie was a God but made a mistake by dropping out too early because he was too concerned about the party defeating Trump"
987,Agreed. You don‚Äôt get to go from ‚Äúnever held political office‚Äù to president
988,"With 99% of the votes in, my estimations say that Joe Biden will win 39 of South Carolina's 54 (72.2%) national convention delegates.

989,"* ****  
Not really a meme about Biden - maybe better for r/MalarkeyBus"
990,That's because people are ignoring the fact that 40-45 percent of youth are going to Biden.
991,I did see one poll out from Michigan since Tuesday showing Joe up on Bernie. But it still included a lot of other candidates.
992,"The real reason we like Biden is simple:  We‚Äôre all corporate overlords don‚Äôt you know?!  That‚Äôs the only reason we could ever like Biden.  Cause we‚Äôre terrified Bernie is going to take away our G5s, hookers, and blow.


That...or maybe we don‚Äôt think $60 trillion deficits are realistic.


But it‚Äôs probably the former."
993,"Joey Diamonds, legend"
994,No I‚Äôm saying Bernie :)
995,All of us
996,"I agree actually but I think it was partly in jest, and I was really just clarifying what they meant."
997,No vote was wasted on Clinton in 2016 she won the popular vote by about 3 million that made a huge statement that the GOP needs the electoral college. Democrats don't need and perhaps are better off without it. I don't regret my vote for Clinton because it proved Trump didn't win in a true democratic way. We love to brag about our freedom and democracy but when it counts most the powers that be will set aside democracy. And the 2016 popular vote proved that Al Gore should have been president which meant no Iraq war and more focus on clean energy.

1000,I think billionaires can pay for their own college *and* higher taxes. The plan will include a sliding scale.
1001,I really wish she would jump in. Bernie won't make her VP and Warren is probably done tonight.
1002,Pete may be the most impressive candidate of my lifetime. But he couldn't win the black vote and that matters. It's gotta be diamond Joe.
1003,"That's what I've been doing!  Text and phone banking from home, and I plan to knock on doors once the world is back to some semblance of normal.  My yard sign is backordered though.  :("

1005,"Her anti-banker stance really resonates with the ""audit the fed"" crowd more than conservatives want to admit. Going hard against wallstreet is something I think a lot of people can get behind."
1006,I can say as a 18 year old. Keep the memes up. I know some people that love Joe literally cause of those Biden bro memes with Obama we saw toward the end of the administration.  I'm not saying memes are gonna win us this election. But at least it'll make it more fun. Especially considering the right can't meme. So it's up to us.
1007,"...Gillum and Nelson lost their races by slim margins (10-20k) and if Darth Bloomberg pours his money into ads down there....and a FL friendly VP pick (Abrams, Demings, Sewell....). Not to mention all the Puerto Ricans who now have residence in FL and are now eligible to vote in the general as they live on the mainland, and they tend to HATE Trump because of Maria (even some conservative politicians on the Island were trashing him). Plus former felons can vote now....

Agree on PA, though, but I think AZ and even FL and NC might be easier than WI. Demographics and recent races don't favor us much in WI...Tammy Baldwin's a unicorn, much like Sherrod Brown. Honestly, I'd be for Tammy as VP in a heartbeat (it would be a nice concession to the progressive wing, too, and I remember her name was tossed around by Bernie supporters) except the VP really should be a WOC...either Black or Latina. Other obvious choice would be Gwen Moore from Milwaukee (lots of experience, progressive, and was a minority whip for the CBC) but since her name never comes up I wonder if there is some skeletons in her past."
1008,"I‚Äôm skeptical she will endorse anyone. Michigan might pull for Joe, but better yet just wait until Florida. Between Bernie‚Äôs unpopularity with older voters and his pro-Castro comments, polls show him struggling to even hit viability. If all of Florida‚Äôs delegates go to Joe it‚Äôs going to hit Sanders like a buzzsaw."

1011,"I think it was expected. A great win nonetheless. If we can take Florida, it virtually blocks of all path for trump."
1012,"Hey, Warren supporter here. My state is yet to vote, and I'm considering either voting Biden or still going ahead and voting Warren. So to be honest, there's only half a vote at stake, and I'm blue no matter who in November so maybe I'm just irrelevant. Who knows. But here's my biggest concern right now:

[Someone ""leaked"" a potential list of Biden apointees](https://www.axios.com/joe-biden-cabinet-vice-president-picks-b17882ac-3953-450f-8afb-38a3c8dcda57.html) and it's concerning. It includes Bloomberg for the world bank and Jamie fucking Dimon for treasury.

As a progressive, a big reason why Bernie hasn't earned my vote is the potential for destructive Bernie nominations, like Nina Turner for VP or Tulsi for anything. There are other reasons, but that's the relevant one here.

But now Biden has a list that's equally concerning if for opposite reasons. When it comes to executive appointments, I want a democratic administration filled with loyal democrats looking to advance the democratic agenda. That has been Biden's selling point in my head up until now.

I love Obama, but one of his biggest mistakes was trying to appoint republicans into his administration in order to appear more bipartisan. It didn't convince anyone on the right, and it gave us Jim Comey who in turn gave us Trump.

Bloomberg isn't a democrat, he just hates Trump. He'll turn around to being our GOP-donor enemy as soon as Trump is out. Dimon says he's barely a democrat and specifically cites the democratic party's economic policies as why he's not solidly a dem. He's one of those socially liberal fiscally conservative types that should be nowhere near a position of economic policy-making in the democratic party.

I know SFP is run by Bernie's campaign, I tried to give them my concerns and they banned me. So if anyone here is involved with Biden's campaign, those are my concerns. Do with them what you will. I'd love it if Biden put these rumors to bed. But again, my vote is probably irrelevant. So good luck. Thanks."
1013,Hell yes!! Welcome aboard.
1014,"If the prospect of another 4 years of Trump are not incentive enough, then I don‚Äôt know what will. Trump‚Äôs policies are the opposite of everything that Biden and Sanders want."
1015,"I think what a lot of Americans need to consider very carefully is that no country will trust America ever again after what Trump did to the Kurds. Yes it was Trump and you can blame him as much as you like for that, but he wasn't the first to do that, and the lack of reaction from much of the DNC really highlights that it's an American problem more than it is a republican one. American politicians view the rest of the world as expendable, and every other country in the world has a small military focused on home defence with global peacekeeping being secondary to that. We are not geared for endless war like America is"
1016,"Ohio‚Äôs deadline to apply for an absentee ballot was March 14th. The Secretary of State has now extended it to May 26th. It needs a good signal boost but that should hopefully help with turn out.

I personally planned to go vote today, but clearly that isn‚Äôt happening."

1025,"Warren is the only major progressive who hasn't made a formal endorsement. Sanders is a socialist. He wants for this country what Chavez did to Venezuela, and his gaggle of malcontents are worse than useless.

Don't act like you're going to vote Biden if only he somehow 'earns' your support by abandoning the principles America was founded on. You aren't going to show up anyway, so why alienate moderates in a counterproductive exercise in trying to make a friend out of an enemy?"
1026,I disagree with Bernie's antics but the coalition could really use the support of the progressive left.
1027,"‚ÄúYou only need to convince 70k + 1 voters to vote in three states‚Äù I mean, I guess. But that‚Äôs also hilariously unrealistic."

1035,"&gt;They have voted for Democrats in the past, but have stated that they think Sanders is ""too liberal"". 

A common socialist saying comes to mind: ""liberals get the bullet too"". Billionaires might be first on Bernie's list of people to liquidate, but his people have open hostility toward the Obamas and Bidens of the world because of a genuine ideological rift."
1036,"**End Forever Wars:** Biden will end the forever wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East, which have cost us untold blood and treasure. As he has long argued, Biden will bring the vast majority of our troops home from Afghanistan and narrowly focus our mission on Al-Qaeda and ISIS. And he will end our support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Staying entrenched in unwinnable conflicts only drains our capacity to lead on other issues that require our attention, and it prevents us from rebuilding the other instruments of American power.

Sorry the Bernie people deleted your post.  We're a much more inclusive community here."
1037,"I think it's Bernie trying to move Biden to the left so that he can get his supporters to back Biden.  It's actually kind of smart but the only danger is Bernie is assuming moving Biden to the left won't hurt him in the general.  I don't know if that is true.  

I hope Joe's team spends all week on preparing to articulate the issues in the way Pete did.  Promote a progressive agenda while speaking in a way that resonates with moderate dems, independents, and disaffected republicans."
1038,"&gt;When Van Jones is astute enough to point out how trash your political strategy is then you know it must be really bad.

I don't know why this isn't more obvious. I've never managed to have a Bernie supporter tell my why their candidate is better. Whether it was Hillary or Warren or now Joe, their fallback is to trash my chosen candidate. They have no arguments in favor of their own. I don't even know what Bernie's arguments are for why I should vote for him. Pay for student debt with a sketchy speculation tax? Pass M4A? 

His only answer is that he'll have a revolution. His revolution can't even show up to vote in a primary. There is no revolution. Just a bunch of people who are angry on the internet."

1045,"&gt; Bernie is one of the poorest senators according to business insider. Biden has close to 20x the net worth of Bernie.

[Biden has a net worth of $9 million, mostly from after the Obama presidency, and that net worth is inclusive of a $1M federal pension. ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelatindera/2019/08/28/joe-bidens-net-worth-how-the-2020-presidential-candidate-built-a-9-million-fortune/#301baa7d104d) That is very much not 20x the net worth of Bernie.

He also has one less house than Bernie."
1046,"Your toxic and nasty rant has suddenly opened my eyes. Ill now vote for a socialist with no record of accomplishments from his 30 year senate career, whos losing the big battleground states in the primary hes also losing. Surely continuing to lose is a brilliant strategy to win big in november!"
1047,"Ok, so it's letting me post comments, but submitting of articles is an issue... hmm."
1048,"It‚Äôs over for Sanders, but we need to keep working hard to make sure this happens. We can‚Äôt be complacent like 2016"
1049,I grew up in MT and have many family and friends there. Currently working to reach out to Bullock to see if I can fill any staff needs for his campaign üòò
1050,So you guys ARE aware of the gaffes?
1051,"Lmfao. Okay bud. It was evident from the beginning you were just blowing smoke out of your ass, but now it‚Äôs crystal clear. What is with your lot and being so hellbent on radicalism that you can‚Äôt open your eyes and see that they never accomplish anything, just like Bernie."
1052,"Not gonna lie, not too different from normality. My work is already fully remote and my social life is basically nonexistent, so the only difference is that I stocked up on like 3x the normal amount of food, and I haven't been outside the apartment complex since."
1053,I can see this and also find it absurd. Wouldn't things workout better if everyone voted on policies. Who cares what another voter does. People are are being petty.
1054,"Florida, Illinois, and Arizona are malarkey free!"
1055,"Glad your coming around, dosen't me you should stop fighting for what you believe in. Just gotta be practical sometimes."
1056,Big facts r/politics doesn't want you to hear
1057,"With the first million votes counted, Biden is currently tripling Sanders. Looking good!"
1058,Good points
1059,This is beautiful! Keep up this amazing work!
1060,"Ok let's see if yall can actually do it. I voted for Bernie and I hope he wins. I am absolutely antagonizing you, mainly because I want to see if you really are more civil than me and if you really mean what you're saying. Frankly, Biden is a strong candidate and I respect you for supporting him. I just think Bernie is a better choice. Good luck tonight."
1061,"Hmm strange, I'm using Chrome maybe that has something to do with it?"
1062,"Oh I'm sure you are, polls look great for Biden vs trump. Dnc can't even get democrats to vote for their ""nominee"", sure it will end well."
1063,"I don't see how stating the facts is disrespectful.  Being a mayor of a small city is in no way the same as being a Senior Senator.  

Is there anything in that statement that is belittling or inaccurate? 

If Joe Biden picked him over a women Senator the world would explode. This is not a slam on him but the reality that he is just getting started and is no where near as accomplished as others."
1064,I can see Kamala in the Supreme Court or as AG. Her attacks on Biden worry me come November because Trump will exploit the hell out of it.
1065,"Biden's polling really well, especially in key swing states. It is unlikely that Bernie will be able to run again until 2028 (which I expect him to do, with the same stump speech)."
1066,You don't have to be Louise Mensch to notice that this is happening at the perfect time for the Russians to sabotage the nominee (like they did last time) and that the accuser happens to be a loyalist to that regime.
1067,"This is really awesome to see. The one that gets me is the lack of authority in prosecuting crimes from non-natives on native land. Until 2013, this included rape. VAWA was originally part of the 94 crime bill that gets so demonized, but Biden was a primary co-sponsor of it. And the 2013 bill at least allowed tribes to prosecute non-native rapists who raped natives. 

I‚Äôm glad to see he‚Äôs not sleeping on the parts that still need addressing. With experience as a senior legislator for so long, he‚Äôs going to pass some really excellent stuff."
1068,Do you think a shakira endorsement would help Biden? I‚Äôm thinking of celebrity endorsements we can get to counter Bernie and trumps
1069,Vote blue no matter who.
1070,"If you want current examples, Arizona today, here are the exit numbers for Arizona from CNN: https://twitter.com/PpollingNumbers/status/1240110694747574278

71% Sanders, 19% Biden for voters under age 45. 

Or if you wanna look back at an older example, how about Super Tuesday: 

CNN: https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/politics/youth-vote-sanders-biden-super-tuesday/index.html

&gt; We saw a very familiar age gap across the Super Tuesday states. Sanders crushed it with younger voters. Looking across all the contests with an exit poll, Sanders won an astounding 61% to Biden's 17% among voters under 30 years old. He even beat Biden by 20 points (43% to 23%) among those between 30 years old and 44 years old.

These numbers are pretty alarming. And should be concerning for the general election. We need these voters to win against Trump. We can't just brush this off and hope it doesn't affect Joe in the general election."
1071,"I would love Warren to be VP or Sec of State.  I know some afraid of her Senate seat but pretty sure whoever Warren would back would win her seat in the special election, it will take a few months to get the bills together to push thru congress anyways we could wait."
1072,He had asthma
1073,Oh fuck off. Getting stuff done in the government isn‚Äôt just sending Santa your wish list. It‚Äôs a team effort and Bernie‚Äôs attitude is basically the political equivalent of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like other guys‚Äù. Joe Biden will actually implement progressive policy by not letting ideological rigidity interfere with his ability to work with other people.
1074,Yang getting love.
1075,"Because people don‚Äôt like being belittled and shouted at.  If someone is belittling and shouting at me, I‚Äôm probably not going to be enticed to support their candidate.  Especially when they completely ignore nuance as to why I may disagree with some policy proposals.  And I didn‚Äôt feel this way about any supporters of other democratic candidates."
1076,This needed to be said. There‚Äôs so much complacency on here it‚Äôs mind boggling. The Bernie camp didn‚Äôt capitalize on their post-Nevada momentum and it gave Joe a huge victory in S.C. and ST. The race isn‚Äôt over till it‚Äôs over
1077,You love to see it
1078,I think he respects Joe more than the Clintons.  The scheduling and location says he might drop out but we can't really know for sure.
1079,"Yes, in fact I think the common phrase used for his healthcare plan is in fact ""universal healthcare."""
1080,"Uh huh. And Bernie is going to turn out new voters, and Bernie is going to win more states then last time, and Bernie appeals to a wide swath of voters, and Bernie has a broad coalition, and Bernie will energize the youth vote, and America agrees with Bernies movment. 

Dont you guys ever get tired of being wrong? So far pretty much none of the assumptions put forward by the Bernie camp have turned out to be true so I pretty much disregard anything you guys say now. You all havent been right about anything. Why should I believe Bernies the one to take Trump when hes losing states he won in `16? I'm taking my chances with Biden next week."
1081,Daaamn. Mic drop ad right there
1082,"Not at all, sorry you aren‚Äôt converting me. I don‚Äôt think the response is necessarily better because of which type of system others have. Some have handled it well like SK, but others poorly like the U.K., which doesn‚Äôt prove anything in terms of how it works. Our biggest problem right now is the ruling party and leader."
1083,"Bernie's time as the frontrunner was so disastrous. 

- Doubled down on Fidel Castro praise
- Ramped up attacks on the Democratic party
- Broke up Public Enemy
- Skipped Selma

He genuinely had a window to be the unifying candidate. But it looks like Dem voters saw what we were getting into, and resoundingly responded!"
1084,take it to the roundtable thread.
1085,"Is anyone else concerned by the level of anti-Bernie sentiment in this sub? 

I'm a former Pete supporter and while I understand the rules of the road have been ""adopted"" they don't seem to be that strictly adhered to. There's no point in being anti-bernie because the main contrast to draw is that Bernie is polarizing and divisive while Biden is positive and unifying. That was Pete's message and I'm sure he endorsed Joe because that's something that we can deliver with Joe's campaign, but it takes serious commitment that I'm not seeing."
1086,Exactly!
1087,Give them time for the General. The ones that don‚Äôt vote for Joe weren‚Äôt going to vote anyway.
1088,"But when Bernie runs TV commercials to try to convince you in 30 seconds to vote for him based on sound bites and images, that‚Äôs a legitimate appeal to the intellect."
1089,Welcome!
1090,"That's not correct.

Allowing the states to choose is not anti pro-choice, he wanted states to choose but he said he understands that women have the right to choose.

He was very pro civil liberties from everything on his website and every interview he did.  Johnson supports the enforcement of Protected Classes that was established by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and believes that providers should be prohibited from discriminating between customers based on demographics, such as race or sexuality.¬†

You are looking at a Hoppe wing of the party, most Libertarian voters are on the much more mainstream Social-Liberal and Market-Liberal wing of the party

 a good example of this is Bill Weld who is running for the Republicans, he has a lot of sway with Libertarians.

The more extreme wings are just more vocal in the party because a lot of Libertarians tend to support their wing in the Dems and GOP.

Your making a lot of generalizations and it's really no difference from saying all democrats are socialists or all Republicans are Nationalists.

I'm aware the Libertarians have extreme wings but so do the Democrats and Republicans and it'd be just as unfair if I were to make the assumption that those radical wings repersented that whole party,  and spread misinformation about one of their candidates.

And it's fine I didn't think you sounded angry I was worried I was coming off as angry, you actually sound very nice."
1091,"Oh man I didn't even THINK of that. He lost me completely when he posted how unfair it was that this guy wasn't getting parole after a ""non homicide"" crime. So I googled it and it was a horrible assault, but the woman didn't die so Shaun was fighting for his release. I was pretty disgusted with myself for ever following him."
1092,"I can tell you that many of Pete‚Äôs supporters weren‚Äôt super sold on Joe, and his endorsement has gone a long way with us. It‚Äôs a pretty enormous factor to take into account for the polls"
1093,That's right out of the left authoritarian handbook.  How terrifying.
1094,He can't force him to do anything. Biden just has to play nice and ensure he gets that endorsement.
1095,"I am so thrilled with this townhall. It was such a smart, engaging way to do things"
1096,None lol
1097,"I mean, we're all still Democrats."
1098,I thought he has to get 1991 delegates to win?
1099,Nothing serious about climate change will get done unless the US gets other big emitters from other countries to agree. There‚Äôs no better deal maker than Joe.
1100,You mean...future former republicans? (As Pete puts it)
1101,We love Chasten.
1102,I did it!!!
1103,voteRBGnomatterwho
1104,I just started noticing that.
1105,No malarkey!
1106,"Well, he ain't wrong."
1107,Don't eat you? As long as you're not ice cream...
1108,"Came across a guy who was attacking bidens nom calling it fake like a bernie fan yesterday. Turned out he was a trump supporter -\_- I think this happens more than people realize, filthy Tantrumplets like to spread division as a legitimate tactic."
1109,"Bernie having to bus people into a rally and forgetting all the people of color is ""rubbish""."
1110,"Thank you! 

It‚Äôs inspiring to see 

The ability to change your mind is a superpower"
1111,Any good down ballot races to follow tonight?
1112,We know Sanders isn't going to drop out before the debate but I winner of he's stay in to= much longer. He is going to get crushed this week.  The more Biden pulls away and the more states he wins the less relevant Sanders looks.
1113,I saw that. I hope he has an epiphany or someone can persuade him to change his mind.
1114,"Yes it does as in reality it's obvious Biden is not going to do anything about healthcare. Certainly not in yhe way of actually fighting for it.

He's gonna do a pretend try and give it up in order to ""be bipartisan"" as if that's always a good thing.

Let's at least be honest about it."
1115,And then he‚Äôs going to try and jump the line and debate Trump. As if.
1116,"No but shows a lack of foresight, empathy or courage. I‚Äôd like a president with all three. Hell I wouldn‚Äôt want a boss without all three."
1117,AoC isn't old enough anyway.
1118,Former 2016 Bernie supporter here. Go Joe!
1119,"New Pete 2 Joe voter, vote on Super Tuesday... I agree on a thread for those of us who need rapid transition mode before all the March elections"
1120,"Like saying he  \*gasp\*

&amp;#x200B;

Failed at something as Mayor. Like literally every other mayor in the world. How horrible"
1121,Joe's half-hour [eulogy at McCain's funeral](https://youtu.be/s9Gx1N4VIu0) was just about the best picture of who Joe Biden is as a human being as you can find. My favorite part was the story about when they were Senators and they would sit next to each other during long Senate sessions and then they each got in trouble from their party leaderships for sitting with the enemy.
1122,Protestors should have spent their time getting out the vote for Bernie there. Won‚Äôt matter after tomorrow.
1123,"Lol, junkie"
1124,The greenwood initiative includes college admission standards - afaik its the only proposal that does
1125,Philadelphia area has become very very blue in the Trump era which is outpacing  the steadiness of Trump's holds in the Western/Central part of the state. PA uniquely has a city like Philadelphia versus the other swing states. WI was flukey bc of Clintons screwups in campaign strategy; FL is always close as shit especially since the Cubans are a unique Republican constituency which makes it challenging.
1126,"""Across a number of measures"" clearly meaning poorer than OECD average of comparable countries, as shown in the data following. Correct.

Every single study proves you wrong.

https://www.who.int/healthinfo/paper30.pdf

https://www.numbeo.com/health-care/rankings_by_country.jsp

https://www.internationalinsurance.com/health/systems/

http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/best-healthcare-in-the-world/

The list is endless. And they do indeed all highlight one thing: the US has a lot of catching up to do. I don't know why it's so hard to accept and you'd rather cling to one out of hundreds of metrics. I've not once said that the health care system is terrible in a broad view around the world. But they rank behind comparable countries while spending literally more than twice as much per person. It's reality, with hundreds of studies saying the same thing. It's like talking to an anti vaxxer or flat earther. Are your beliefs more important than facts?

Facts are they spend more, quality of healthcare is not the best and accessibility of healthcare is terrible."
1127,$15 minimum wage is a pretty good one.
1128,"I like AOC. I do not care who she endorses, she is pretty neat."
1129,That only covers half a roll of 1-ply.
1130,"Gravel.  Jesus, he must be 90 by now."
1131,"Wellll, Ohio has a large manufacturing base, which Indiana never had. The key difference is that white blue collar vote in most of the rust belt (which excludes Indiana, except in Indianapolis and Gary)."
1132,"If no candidate gets a majority (say it's 270-268 but there's a faithless elector it would also go to house), then yes, it goes to the house, but it isn't a straight vote, the house can vote for any of the top three EC receivers.

Instead each state delegation gets one vote. So it becomes a question of who controls the most state delegations and that is likely to remain republican."
1133,Ur right
1134,He‚Äôs trying to reconcile the two bases. It‚Äôs ridiculous that it might work for like 10% of them too.
1135,His policies demand that human nature evolves from small tribal groups to global utilitarian so its not he is selfish but he needs us to be not selfish.  His policies are not anthropologically sound. It would be like wanting to build a house out of feathers.   Sounds great but not possible.
1136,so long as it's not someone who quits politics because they can't handle it what so ever.
1137,"This is a poor take. Let‚Äôs win by addition, not subtraction. 30% of dems on average are showing up and voting for him, we can‚Äôt just exile them from the party because we don‚Äôt like what some sanders supporters do online."
1138,Concern trolling (like OPs post) is also against the rules of the sub.
1139,"&gt;Kamala Harris didn‚Äôt keep inmates in longer than three sentences but did keep many inmates that were no threat to the public in far after they were eligible for parole.

No, she didn't. One of her (over 1000) employees wrote an argument suggesting that they could do that. It was not implemented and Harris denounced it when it was brought to her attention. As AG she broadly *increased* the number of early releases/paroles and reduced the prison population by 1/3rd by the end of her time in office.

Not going to dig up a can of worms with the other stuff but regardless of your opinion on them I'd hope you can see why it'd make many Democrats who feel otherwise distrustful of her."

1143,How tf are you supposed to accomplish things when you have so many people advocating against it? All you Biden goers are just voting for the same shit. It‚Äôs not even about Bernie. It‚Äôs about finally getting something done with someone who advocates for the people. But y‚Äôall to damn blind to see that. Keep on voting in the people who NEVER think about you though.
1144,I‚Äôm down with that one!
1145,"I wasn‚Äôt rooting for Bloomberg in any way, but especially now that he‚Äôs out, I can appreciate what (I think) he was trying to do. He sees a rich guy get elected President via a disinformation campaign, and he thinks, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm more rich, and can make a more convincing ad and beat him at his own game to win the country back.‚Äù

He‚Äôs bankrolled multiple campaigns for other people and feels his money is ultimately the reason they got elected. He had that slip in the 7th (?) debate about how he ‚Äúbought‚Äù Congressmen. He sees this spending as using the power he has to put people in positions of authority who will speak against Trump.

I am quite clearly idealistic, but when it was announced that he‚Äôs hired people to put together nepotism ads about Trump‚Äôs kids that he will only release if Trump starts a disinformation campaign against Biden‚Äôs kid, I felt validated. I think he‚Äôs trying to do something good here, and may have a very important part yet to play."

1147,Welcome!
1148,This woman needs a GD vacation
1149,"She may wait like in 2016. Or she may join to further hammer in the unity point. It's her choice, and whatever she chooses, I think it'll be for the right reasons.   
  
Either way, I felt like she sounded a lot like Pete in that interview. It's nice to see her get back to (IMO) herself. I felt like this campaign lead her to make some disingenuous attacks that didn't feel like her persona. Except against Bloomberg, sorry if there are any Mike ppl here, but she took out the leftover big bank rage and eviscerated him.  
  
This would have been Bernie vs Bloomberg had she not. Although someone else would have hit him on those points, I don't think they would've dismantled his responses so thoroughly."

Check out this piece from October with Pete commenting on Joe


https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/henrygomez/joe-biden-gay-marriage-equality"
1155,"Yeah, there‚Äôs still a decent chance of that for sure. But Sanders‚Äô campaign can‚Äôt be happy with those numbers."
1156,What he's done is plenty! Some people aren't in a position where those around are so receptive.
1157,I think the DCCC should make a compromise that theyll ease rules around Justice Dem challenges in the future in exchange for internal pressure to get Bernie out (see you AOC+Ro Khanna).
1158,"Yeap. I'm listening to a great audiobook right now, ""Russians Among Us"" by Gordon Corera, and it's all about Russia's post cold war spy game.

I hate to say it, but the Obama administration fucked up so badly that I almost wish Romney won in 2012. They refused to take Moscow seriously despite many red flags. Romney might have thought they were a threat for the wrong reasons, but at least he identified them as a threat.

And the ""reset"" was naive as fuck. The only thing that gives me comfort is I'm sure Biden has a major chip on his shoulder regarding Russia right now, and I think he's learned from his past mistakes. As opposed to fucking Bernie who won't even vote to sanction them."
1159,"&gt; but I see no reason to be mistrust him.



You watched the last debate right? He lied directly to the American people. I'm not voting on trust when I vote for him in November. I don't trust a damn thing that comes out of Biden's mouth. He's a liar. He's just the lesser evil liar."
1160,"Yep, if you do buybacks don‚Äôt be asking for a bailout later"
1161,What do you guys think about Biden and foreign policy? Countries in the EU don't like him and we will need to work together a lot after this coronavirus malarkey

And the key to winning the election is moderates! To win the election, moderates that would normally vote Republican will need to vote for Joe. A platform that appeals too far to the left will drive moderates to either vote for Trump or not vote at all."
1167,You mean the ones Biden wants to release from jail?
1168,"Most of the reliable voters (age 40+) are way less active on social media, especially sites that arent like facebook/linkedin, and the engagement only goes lower the higher the age goes (most 60 year olds dont know what reddit is). It's really not as big an issue in a practical sense most likely."
1169,"I‚Äôll tell you, if we can get Mikes digital operation supporting joe - they can take on the Russians and Trump"
1170,Luckily there is no sign of an April debate happening as of yet.
1171,"I‚Äôll admit most of what I‚Äôve seen of him has been bad. I‚Äôll still vote for him, just not nearly as excitedly.

A lot of the reason for not knowing about him though is because he doesn‚Äôt excite the youth and rides so much off name recognition. I have yet to meet in person somebody who supports joe Biden. Let‚Äôs hope that name recognition and being not Trump is enough to carry him though."
1172,Good work!

1190,"Nobody should be surprised that he hasn't even tried to unite Democrats, he isn't even one."
1191,"No it‚Äôs the media using the virus to attack trump like russia and ukraine. That‚Äôs the hoax, create mass fear over covid not that democrats created it."
1192,"Why does he want to decriminalize Marijuana but is worried about it being a ""gateway drug""?

Why does he want to do anything that makes sense when it comes to drug policies?  Has everyone forgotten about the RAVE act?  Which is essentially to blame for any deaths at festivals or shows by banning the participation of drug testing and harm reduction organizations.

Can Joe stand up to Trumps childish criticisms that very much throw off the tempo on a debate stage?

Anyone who believes that Joe has a chance at beating Trump is dancing with crazy.  I don't want to say never, (Trump did win before) but Joe is extremely unlikely to beat Trump.

It is crazy to me that someone who is running on the ""I am friends with Obama"" platform is taken seriously.  Is Joe any different than Hillary at the end of the day?  He is going to take things back to status quo pre-Trump.  ""People don't want a revolution, they want results""

A vote for Joe is a vote for the same ol' political shit.  He is going to make all these promises then never deliver.  Just like every politician before him."

1200,"Ohhhh ok, I understand it more now. Thanks for the clarification"
1201,At this point it's even a public health risk getting people to come out. Bernie has no path to the nomination so this is an unnecessary risk.
1202,Why
1203,I can't even pinpoint my own views on the spectrum.  I don't think there has been a good Republican to vote for even in my purple state.
1204,"&gt;I live in a state that will basically always go blue

Like Michigan did, 1988-2016?"

1214,I believe so
1215,The scary thing about Bernie's campaign is that most of his attacks on the Clintons were recycled by Trump's. He did more harm than good by repeating the same stump speech about NAFTA that ended up making Trump look smarter than he is to the Rust Belt.

* Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court Cheri Beasley"
1228,"Pete is a hell of a man. 

Early on, at first I was wondering what is this guy doing in the election, I pitted him as someone just in it for some publicity so he can pad his resume and sell a memo. After reading a little about him and his background, seeing more of him, wow.. a hell of a man,

Please make him Secretary of State. It would be so proud to see him represent US on the international stage."
1229,I am bursting with satisfaction. I am going to spend the next week being an insufferable shit all over Reddit to all the people who have been complete and utter pricks to all the Joe and Yang and Pete and Amy and Tulsi supporters for the past five months.
1230,Owning the libs? Sounds more like a disruptive Putin move.
1231,"To be fair, there is a difference between negative campaigning and abusive attacks. The article you sighted states that a pro Bernie talking point script regrading Warren read:

  **‚Äúpeople who support her are highly-educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what‚Äù and that ‚Äúshe's bringing no new bases into the Democratic Party.‚Äù** 

This isn't a personal attack against Warren, and it is at least partially true (her demo did tend to skew highly-educated and affluent) even if it contains speculation. This does not seem remotely outside the bounds of a political campaign, so I don't think it is at all comparable it to the clearly abusive behavior of some online. I have no interest in defending that bad behavior, but I don't see how anyone could think that would be characteristic of most Sanders supporters.

The majority of Bernie's base are people who want a rational system of universal healthcare, an stop to endless war, and action on climate change commensurate with the scale of the threat. I don't see how the average person who supports all these humanistic goals could also take joy in tormenting people online."

1234,I mean ultimately besides super blue states they wouldn‚Äôt be able to put enough pressure on them anyways. The good news is the conversation has been started and the country is definitely moving towards some of the concepts that Bernie has been championing.
1235,"I'm actually surprised she's dropping out. But I hope she throws her support behind Joe. If she has so many ""plans"" then why not work with someone who can actually create an environment to get them done?"
1236,It's the same kind of nonsense that the right is talking about when they discuss the Deep state. It's the left version of the deep state that the media is all out to get them. Funny how both the far-left and far-right thinking media is out to get them
1237,Im 23 in Florida and voting Biden. I think Bernie is a fraud selling a lie to desperate and scared young people.
1238,"Bernie was losing the primary to Hillary almost just as bad as he‚Äôs losing to Joe now.  She almost won a majority of pledged delegates outright.  However, Bernie stayed in the race far longer than he should have and beat up Clinton when she could have been focusing on the General Election.


This is sadly Bernie‚Äôs modus operandi."
1239,Maybe if we get a Joe and Pete ticket it would be blue again!
1240,after tonight he will be!
1241,"I consider myself very liberal, voted for Bernie in 2016, previously supported Beto, Warren, and Pete in this primary (it‚Äôs been rough). I‚Äôm supporting Joe because of the reasons you listed: Bernie is very divisive, and will almost certainly be a drag on house and senate races. We need to win the Senate to get *anything* done at all, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible with Bernie as the nominee, but with Biden, it can be, because our candidates in Arizona, North Carolina, and Maine won‚Äôt feel forced to distance themselves from him.

My rationale really is just that it‚Äôs more progressive to actually make progress at all rather than waste time and energy pursuing an ‚Äúideal‚Äù solution that doesn‚Äôt have the support to pass. I‚Äôd prefer Biden to be more liberal on some things, but overall I think we‚Äôd see more progress on issues with him than Bernie because of that."
1242,"Dates: Mar. 8, 2020

Spread: **Biden +32**

The pollster has a B/C rating from FiveThirtyEight."
1243,"I was a Pete supporter, now on team Joe, but it was always obvious that Warren has one of the biggest hearts. She truly cares for the people and I think she's done the most homework and is the most detailed of anyone that was on the debate stages. She was one of the best debaters (debates were her best medium imo.) She knocked out Bloomberg all on her own.  Unfortunately, though I thought she was right on the issues, she went too far sometimes with accusations and purity tests (that she herself does not pass) and it made me question her political instincts.

This is incredibly sad news to hear that such a fighter for the people - the person that has worked the hardest to make Sanders' plan actually feasible - is dropping out. I don't think Sanders has ever given her credit."
1244,No. Because the young voters aren't voting regardless.
1245,"All due respect, I trust polls more than anecdotes. It isn't changing overnight, it's been changing since 2008. Clinton received 570,000 more votes than Obama in 2012 did. O'Rourke received 900,000 more votes than the previous Democratic candidate in 2012. 

Regardless of the outcome, Trump is going to have to contest Texas, and that's resources and time not spent in other states that he absolutely needs to win (WI, PA, FL, etc)."
1246,Doubtful.  Gun owners who believe in that second amendment bullshit would‚Äôve never voted for a Democrat anyway.  This is not a new issue by any stretch.
1247,Thank You AOC.
1248,Jennifer Granholm would be interesting but I think she's been out of politics for too long now. If she had left office more recently I think she'd be at the top of the list.
1249,"There‚Äôs been ugly and crazy primaries before. 08 is a good example a lot of people turn to. The 92 Democratic primary was interesting since everyone thought it‚Äôd be a landslide for Bush and no one wanted to be the Democrat who lost. 

1960 was interesting since it was the last of the ‚Äúold style‚Äù primaries where you still had strong regional blocs (ie Southern Democrats) who were influential. In the beginning of the 1960 election, Kennedy was considered ‚Äúrunning for Vice President. Stuart Symington, Hubert Humphrey, and Adlai Stevenson were the front runners initially."

1256,"More like that was the measure that trump set for himself. He said he's great and that is why the stock market was going well. Well, now that it's down, that must mean according to his own standard he is doing a shitty job and Obama was a much better president."

1259,I hope he stays hunkered down during this for the most part. We do not need him getting the virus.
1260,"I wrote like a whole essay thing on my reasons.

Biden is the strongest candidate on foreign policy. He has a deep well of experience simply unmatched by other candidates. As I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll agree, Trump has done serious damage to our foreign relations. This is a uniquely difficult time in the world, with democracy under threat from the rise of authoritarian nations and Trump has sided with dictators and has isolated us from our allies. Biden knows these leaders. He has spent time with these leaders. More than that, he truly understands the importance of NATO and democracy promotion. He understands that the actions taken in the next four years could likely determine the course of this century in human rights and global affairs. He is particularly strong on China. Biden has spoken with passion on the treatment of the Uyghurs and will make human rights an important issue in US-China relations, as it should be. He is the only candidate with a detailed plan for responding to a potential Chinese invasion of autonomous Hong Kong. He supports reviving something similar to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but with more worker‚Äôs rights protections and anti-outsourcing measures to create a powerful trading block of Pacific democracies to compete with China, and he has stated a willingless to consider options up to and including sanctions and economic isolation to pressure the Chinese government. He knows that a strong America is good for the world, and that the world‚Äôs democracies must unite to combat the tyrrany and corruption of nations such as Russia, China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. He supports using our considerable soft power, I.E. diplomatic influence, to push for justice. This is also the only true path to lasting peace, as democracies don‚Äôt go to war against other democracies. He rightly has strong reservations about using our military to solve problems that do not have a military solution or could be solved through diplomacy. He strongly opposed and argued against President Obama‚Äôs troop surge. 

Outside of foreign policy, he has the longest and strongest record of actually passing progressive legislation. He wrote the Violence Against Women Act. He helped pass the Assault Weapons Ban. As Vice President, he got our troops out of Iraq, pushed Obamacare through congress, helped negotiate the Iran Nuclear Deal, and was instrumental in various budget negotiations. He has deep relationships on Capitol Hill and the experience to get his proposals passed. He will add a public option, which will help put us on the path to a single payer system, which I support as the eventual goal. He will make the United States a global leader on climate change, creating thousands of new jobs. He will push for justice on issues from race to LGBT rights and more. He will appoint judges who understand that the constitution guarantees our rights, including the right for women to make their own decisions about their bodies. 

Furthermore, I would also posit that, in such uniquely challenging times in the world, now more than ever we need to elect a candidate who knows how to restore our standing in the world, and also that as the president has a particularly large amount of control over foreign policy that this issue is especially critical in the presidential race, as opposed to congressional races, which are less important for foreign policy. Take health care. Let‚Äôs say that you support enacting medicare for all immediately. electing a president who supports that does not ensure that that would get passed by congress, while electing a president who supports a public option instead does not ensure that negotiations with congress won‚Äôt result in medicare for all instead. The president has the power to sign and veto legislation, urge congress, and push for their positions. On foreign policy, though, electing a president who, let‚Äôs say, opposes making human rights a focus of U.S.-China relations almost certainly assures that they won‚Äôt be, while electing a president who supports that almost certainly assues that they will be. 

Also, it‚Äôs what people do when they think that no one is watching that provides the best view of their true nature. Biden‚Äôs true nature shows that he cares about people more than pretty much any politician. Here‚Äôs an example of what he does when he thinks that nobody is watching. From the very beginning of his political career, every time he ran for anything, this woman in Delaware would send him a $25 check. Not that long ago, she died. Joe was reading the newspaper and saw her name in the obituaries section. He had never met her, but he felt compelled to pay his respects. He went for a shiva call (Jewish mourning practice). There were no cameras, this was not a public relations stunt, and Joe never mentioned it. The story was brought to light by her family. 

Finally, Biden understands that America has rarely, if ever, lived up to anything anywhere near the lofty ideals that we hold, but he understands that there was a sense of pride and unity, optimism and determination, and idealism that has been lost. He wants to restore that, but as an inclusive vision that actually lives up to our aspirations and leaves no one behind. This is quite possibly our last chance to recapture that knowledge of what America can be, that vision of what our destiny can be, that was advanced by such figures as John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Frank Church, and Walter Mondale. Restoring that vision in the next few years could ensure it‚Äôs survival, while I fear that failing to bring that vision back now will mean that it could be gone forever. No one else running focuses on much beyond their individual policies. Many say they can unite us, but no one provides the unifying vision that we had, that we need. This is what makes America special. This vision is Joe Biden‚Äôs vision
(From his website)-Joe‚Äôs Vision:

‚ÄúWe are in a battle for the soul of America. It‚Äôs time to remember who we are. We‚Äôre Americans: tough and resilient. We choose hope over fear. Science over fiction. Truth over lies. And unity over division. We treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor. We are the United States of America. And together, there is not a single thing we cannot do.‚Äù

Joe also states on his website, ‚ÄúOur best days still lie ahead.‚Äù Let‚Äôs elect someone with the experience, tenacity, and vision to make this statement a reality. It‚Äôs not yet too late. If we work together, we can do it."

1263,"Only 134 showed up to caucus. Sanders gets 84 votes, Biden gets 48 votes, and 2 voters were ""uncommitted"" 

I know the Northern Mariana Islands is a small territory and sparsely populated, but only 134 people showing up to caucus is still extremely low. SMH

1271,"Bernie's climate plan relies on the development of technologies that don't currently exist, namely in the photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells and battery storage.

Solar power is great, but it's intermittent.  And the best solar cells still only have around a 25% efficiency.  In order for solar to be effective across the board, we must have better efficiency in the cells and a better ability to store energy at night or during off periods.  Neither of those exist today, and California alone would need something 35 million megawatts of storage.

No serious climate change plan excludes nuclear energy either.  Bernie's brand of granola politics plays fine in Vermont, but places like the midwest would be shit outta luck if we told them they were on their own without NG.  Nuclear is the most efficient energy source we have, and can be a useful 50 year stopgap until we either have better solar cells, wildly more efficient storage, or the holy grail of nuclear fusion."

Having a 40-45% favorability rating just means that you aren't personally thought of that highly. Having a 40-45% *approval* rating means the job you've been doing for 3.5 years isn't being viewed highly. The latter is much more significant to a candidate's chances. 

Even if we were to base his chances at re-election on favorability ratings, Trump's net approval right now is -9.1, Biden's net approval is -0.3, so...

Warren gave what I thought of as the best of both worlds and the way they trashed her will not play well here."
1339,"Best read in awhile.   There ain‚Äôt no point in preaching to people who think Biden is the messiah.  What gets me most, is that had Biden done half as good on Super Tuesday, Sanders might have had a chance to strong arm Biden into putting universal healthcare on the ticket.  With how embarrassingly things went down, universal healthcare is dead.  

Furthermore, sanders campaign is dead, anything short of the magic number and a contested convention means Biden is the nominee.  Seriously he could be a single delegate short and Biden will be appointed.

Alas, a Biden win equates to 8 more years  of no universal healthcare.  This is evidenced by the health insurance stocks rising nearly 10% the Wednesday after Super Tuesday.  So it comes down to 4 more years of trump, or 8 more years of business as usual.  

My strategy, is to promote 3rd party liberal.  Force a trump win, and make the democratic committee take us progressives seriously or face future trumps.  As in my vote is valuable, and if u want it, earn it."

1349,"We live in a foreign relations world. If virus hasn't taught you that, then I don't know what to tell you. Your foolish to bring war into this. That is the last possible faucet and outcome we would ever want. Hard military power is not what matters. Soft power does. Aussie land is relatively disliked among our asian allies and neutral partys like India- who we should be reaching out too, as well as Germany. The United Kingdom is now isolated. I am not saying leaving either of them to the sharks, but to keep them at the same level that they were will cost us politically. The old school thinking of honor is dangerous. Get that out of your system, in international politics, you try to set the board to your liking, not stick with your friends when they throw the board to the ground and stomp on the pieces- which is what Aussieland and the UK have done.  

Our time is over. We live in a multipolar world. I have stated this in other comments- the United States has and will maintain its super power status, while China is a great power and is highly dependent on the American system. The real threat comes from the EU and Climate change. The EU won't try to rival us- far from it. They will instead build soft power and will become a ""soft"" counter weight if we don't stop our relationship decline with mainland Europe. I do not doubt that the Corona Virus has made the United States, the Italians, the French, and the Spanish to look like bumbling idiots. This will only increase Germany's central power over world politics- which has been growing the last 10 years, if anyone in reddit actually paid attention to what has been a masterclass in politics  by Merkel. Whether its been luck or savy intelligence is debatable, but she's used every crisis to further Germany's soft power without having to increase her hard power, and weakening rivals considerablly while playing them against each other. Her handling of the Russian issue has been handled incrediablly well, as well as the Urukian situation, she also has China eating out of the hand of her palm, while growing relations with Iran and Indian creating respective counterweights to the Saudi backed alliance and Turkey, an enemy of Germany. Has Germany had its failures? Yes, it hasn't been able to break up the Franco-Spanish-Italian block in the EU nor cut off Greece from Russia. Covid might do both , and it will change the EU radically if it happens. 

Yes, hard power is still intact, but its absolutely the LAST resort we want in any Asian situation. China is a delicate situation, but soft power can handle it. If your a neoliberal, you scare the living shit out of me for even mentioning a war in Asia. Staying out of it will be healthier then getting involved.  

As for the domestic political situation- don't underestimate democrats desire to fight each other. Bluedogs will balk at the left, the left will balk at the bluedogs, the inbetweeners will scramble to work something out, and it will end up being a mess. I trust Nancy to lead the house- but whoever leads the Senate is going to have be considerably skilled. Chuck is not that. He'll get the rank and file democrats to accommodate either one or two of the groups, but  he will have to struggle for every 51st vote if we win 3-4 seats this time around. 

Listen I hope I am wrong. I have been watching politics for the last 20 years of my life, and I know the formula down to the tee for this country. America is not hard to understand- its an individualistic system with a severe lack of understanding of cause and effect. Its a toxic situation with all the problems we have in both voting and an under educated populace. 

I actually believe healthcare will pass after this crisis. Whether it will be universal or not will be interesting."

He advertises himself (and is advertised by the media) as an absolute centrist, generally center-right (that one's more media trying to push him to moderate republicans than Biden himself).

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of his supporters also do a terrible job with this, considering I just had a 2 hour argument with a staunch ""politically active"" Biden supporter who said he was voting Biden because he was against a minimum wage increase, expanding healthcare, and that they think government-supported affordable housing programs are ""just government funded ghettos like the Nazis"". 

These are all things Biden has in his platform, and yet it seems the overwhelming majority of Biden voters haven't even cared enough to see what it is that he supports, and just wanted the ""normal"" aspect, and many are actually AGAINST Biden's policies when told what he supports but just feel that he's the right guy for them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm personally not *opposed* to a Biden presidency, although I'm also not exactly for it, I'm not complaining if he is fairly elected (majority or plurality). He's just really hard to sell because of the reputation, the same way Sanders is hard to sell because of his false reputation."

You can be a progressive and not support Bernie Sanders. I've been fighting for progressive positions and progressive democrats since I was 18. Many of those positions Bernie holds now we were fighting for and setting the groundwork for then.  


People aren't incrementalists because they want to be. They are because that's the reality of how our system is designed. it demands compromise, hard-work. You think that's wrong? Okay, but how are you going to do that?

I‚Äôve been studying candidates for over 55 years, comparing their promises, their body language, their repetitions, and their attacks with or without the use of truth (mostly without), and it has helped me to understand their character in short order.  Neither Sanders nor Warren would get anything accomplished, both of them being far too confrontational to garner support, even from some congressional Democrats.  Bloomberg and Gabbard have created reputations for themselves (remember Tulsi declining to vote on Trump, or ‚Äústop and frisk‚Äù?) so poor they should never even considered running.  I‚Äôm glad that Klobuchar finally saw the light, but had hoped Pete would at least see how Super Tuesday would fare for him (I saw where he still got about 10% in California), so who does that leave?  I‚Äôm still trying to decide if I even want to go to my state‚Äôs caucus next week.  Losing Pete hit a lot harder than I expected."

1382,"This is such a ridiculous viewpoint. A higher education is almost essential in getting a career for many people, since not everyone can work a blue collar job. Youre comparing Student Loan debt vs your car or house mortgage, and I dont see how those correlate. Yes, they are both debt, but one is basically essential to getting a career, and the other two are fruits of your success in getting a job. Many people take out loans as a way to pursue higher education, and not everyone has the access or possibility of getting scholarships. Can we not give everyone equal opportunity to pursue higher education without the fear of being in debt your entire life? For some people student loan debt is the only option. There is no reason that forgiving student loan debt should also mean your entitled to a forgiveness on your credit card debt, car, or mortgage debt, because theyre completely different things."

1396,"&gt; Bernie can't really go too hard after him in the debate

The summary of his campaign was that he didn't go hard enough against Biden which ultimately lead to his failure, and I don't suspect he will during the debate either. What I got from his speech today (which was essentially him admitting defeat) was that every single exit poll showed support for Sanders policies, but people wanted an electable candidate in Biden.  He wants to address what Joe plans on doing about those voters' policy stances, can't alienate them and risk losing the general election."
1397,Congrats!
1398,"No, not possible. If Joe got every single delegate on March 10 (including Democrats Abroad), which obviously won't happen, he'd still be like 900 delegates shy of the majority. Though that doesn't include delegates left to be assigned in California and the other Super Tuesday states still counting.

So no, he can't be the presumptive nominee by 3/15, and I'm sure they'll have to debate (and I'm sure Sanders is counting on a really strong performance to change the narrative)."
1399,"I was just correcting a false notion of the Canadian system.  Yes, they don‚Äôt allow for duplication of services.  

Again, it doesn‚Äôt matter.  Americans have spoken time and time again, we want for-profit health insurance companies between us and our care providers.  It‚Äôs really that simple.  I‚Äôll never understand why, but it‚Äôs not going to stop me from trying to elect someone who‚Äôs a lot better than Trump.  My side (Warren voter, here) lost and America has spoken in favor of for-profit health insurers.  Maybe we‚Äôll get another chance after a (hopefully) Biden presidency.  Until then, a lot of people are going to keep dying.  It sucks, but that‚Äôs America."

First of all, there were well over a hundred people there voting.. probably more than 150 in all honesty, and that‚Äôs with people coming and leaving non stop.For those curious.. 85% for Joes demographic would be my estimate. Take that for what it‚Äôs worth. 

They had plenty of volunteers outside directing traffic (as well as campaign people making last minute pushes), volunteers directing people along, and people confirming identities. My wife and I had about two minutes of wait time. They had plenty of anti bacterial lotion and safety rubber fingers for those doing electronic voting.

Biden is going to win the nomination, and we don't need to eviscerate their icon on a personal level to do it."
1405,"No, people all want that.

It's just that Bernie doesn't have the proper funding mechanisms for it; and when it fails to be funded, this would damage any other credibility from future candidates proposing similar universal healthcare and affordable college tuition.

It's the policies that are the problem, and not the issue that the policies are trying to address."
1406,"I joined this sub to try and learn more about Biden's policies and see what kind of discussions were going on. I'm really not feeling great about any of Biden's policies or his chances against Trump in the general.

All hope is not lost though... 2024 might be different. Suffering through four more years of Trump might get people to finally wake the fuck up and nominate an actual progressive Democrat who will work for us rather than strictly fulfilling the will of their wealthy donors.

Bernie is a once in a lifetime candidate. It's too bad you guys are blowing it just because the MSM told you Biden is more ""electable."""

1422,I feel like I‚Äôve made most progress communicating the idea that Joe Biden is a bridge builder unlike any other in Washington the past 20 years and that Washington is so fundamentally stacked against all forms of progressive law that he‚Äôs literally one of the only people in America who will be ale to get his platform passed. I cite the partisanship obstruction on Obamacare and how he got those votes to get it done. I cite his success going up against the NRA. I cite his ability to bring world leaders to the table for accords and nuclear treaties. I tell them that Bernie moved the entire party further to the left but that only Joe has what it takes to move from promises to policy that becomes law and helps us all. Democratic voters have seen GOP obstruction so often that I truly believe the brand Biden has as a results-oriented man who gets things done is appealing to many and reassuring. That ‚Äúroll up the sleeves and get it done for people‚Äù image he has is appealing in this partisan era and seeing all of these former rivals line up to endorse him really helps play into that image even more.

Worse yet, they've trained themselves to ignore and deny any evidence that might show the obvious differences, even going so far as making up--and now in the information age it's as easy as sharing already made up--false information to attack and belittle anyone not beholden to their personal ideology."
1451,"This group of comments is exactly why VP talk was banned for several weeks.

Everyone has their pick and they start getting iffy over it. Plagued with infighting on this stupid bullshit is wrong.

Now, Biden did bring out the getting issue and we'll be a bit more open to the topic, but if these continue to devolve into a dick measuring contest, they can just as easily be banned again."
1452,He needs to drop out of the race and get evaluated by a doctor. He seems to be in the beginning stages of dementia.
1453,"I'm not going to spend much time responding to this cause I'm tired but here goes. Biden is not more progressive than Obama, he's less Centrist. Being a progressive today involves supporting specific policies, it's not a broad term, it doesn't just mean someone who gets things done. Biden would have been progressive not long ago but the spectrum has shifted and now he's a centrist and a moderate, not a progressive.

Nominating an establishment candidate is how we lost the house, senate, and presidency in the first place. Trump was the anti-establishment candidate and that title benefited him immensely against Clinton. Would Biden win against Trump? Almost certainly, Trump is no longer anti-establishment, he is the establishment. But would Bernie fail to win the house and/or senate? Noone knows, it's been nearly a hundred years since we've had a candidate like Bernie Sanders, but FDR won four terms so I don't see why he wouldn't be able to win.

Once again I'd like to emphasize that Biden is not a progressive, because being a progressive in the modern political landscape of this country implies supporting policies like Medicare for All. Getting things done doesn't make you a progressive, that definition is so broad and encompassing it hurts."

I suspect you won't hear from hum until bernie taps out at the very earliest. Which is hopefully soon. We need unity ticket this moment."
1458,"As far as I can tell she‚Äôs all talk. :/ still waiting for her to actually do something constructive besides blasting twitter. 

I miss the old guard."
1459,"I think part of it is the disillusionment of growing up through the financial crisis, followed by coming of age during the rise of police brutality, Trump's election, increase in student loan debt, etc. after being taught for many years that racism ended with MLK and Obama, that working hard would leave you fulfilled, etc. So we (I use the royal 'we' here) end up distrusting ""traditional"" power structures, despite the reasons for the failures being unrelated from those structures. We disown capitalism because we feel like it's failed us, when it really the more specific problems in the otherwise okay system that failed us. 

Bernie ended up feeding into that disillusionment, allowing our generation to be susceptible to more radical ideas and making them believe that he was the *only* option, that he was the *only* one fighting for us, and that everyone else is against us. It'll be interesting to see how it pans out when our generation grows up and actually finds steady jobs."

"""
1498,"As a 'youth' voter, I'm pretty consistently disappointed in their turnout so far."
1499,"Genuine input here, so hear me out:

If you think that Bernie voters are going to come over to Biden, you sorely misunderstand why they vote for Bernie in the first place. They do not view things like you do.

This isn't about who is their preferred flavour of Democrat, this is about rejecting ineffectual centrism that always capitulates to the whims of big capital at the expense of people. This is about breaking the US-system that has dominated for decades, and resulted in two parties that basically represent the same thing.

To Bernie voters, there is no real difference between Biden and Trump in outcome, only in their style. Biden is the civil, friendly face of American hegemony and capital, and Trump is its nasty face.

You have to understand this: Bernie supporters aren't going to go over to Biden, *they simply won't vote*. I've been following the campaign closely, but were I eligible to vote in the USA and Biden was the candidate, I wouldn't vote either. Bernie has, by far, *the largest* bloc of voters who will not support *anyone* other than their candidate.

And, as a result, Biden will lose to Trump."

&gt;We may not agree with every policy that was decided before we were allowed a say, but the sacrifices made by the public servants who did, have enabled us to dream bigger and reach higher.  And yet their mistakes have caused us pain that no apology can make right.

&gt;These inadequacies can not be our excuse to retreat. They must be the reason we rally. If not, it will be our generation who will have to apologize.

&gt;Apologize to the children who have been separated from their parents, put in cages, and robbed of their future. I am confident that we won‚Äôt be forgiven for helping Donald Trump get re-elected by saying ‚Äúsorry but Biden‚Äôs policies just weren‚Äôt progressive enough for me‚Äù"

1511,"That's like saying we make more money than those in the 70s. Technically we do by amount, but not we adjust for inflation. The progressive bar moves just the same as we lose more opportunity and wealth. Adjusting for changing of popular opinion, average debt, wealth inequality, level of opportunity, amount of money in politics, level of global warming, cost of health care: Biden is Gore 2.0."
1512,I can't believe making fraudulent medical services disclose what their doing was struck down. The judiciary is honestly the worst like 60% of the time.

You will find some discussion about our concerns with the small but very real and active subset of Sanders supporters who do engage in cyberbullying and trolling, but we certainly understand that most Sanders supporters are not like that. We don't have anything against progressives, in fact, many of us are progressives. Being a moderate doesn't necessarily mean you don't agree with progressive goals, but believe that the best way to achieve those goals is through incremental progress rather than trying to achieve everything at once. Anyways, sorry if you got the wrong idea from this sub. You and any other progressive is certainly welcome here."
1531,"Well Bernie isnt exactly as consistent as you believe, he was anti immigration, he voted down the immigration reform bill in 08, he was pro gun and when the aca was passed he was pro public option. 

Biden was influential in passing the aca while bernie sat on the sidelines, and was instrumental in the paris accords. So  Bidens already done more to fight for healthcare reform and climate change then Bernie. Bernie talks a good game but he hasnt done much to fight for what he talks about."

1540,"&gt;My god it would be glorious if Trumpism was defeated with a historic groundswell of voters coming to the (political) battelfield to lend their Voices.

This is something I think people don't place enough importance on. It's not enough to simply eek out a win against Trump. We need to lead a landslide against him and his Republican bootlickers in Congress and the states so both toss them out of office, but also show them that this kind of politics won't win in America. 2018 was a start but had ambiguity due to the GOP increasing their Senate majority and winning some key Gov races. We need an unambiguous pounding coast to coast, up and down the ballot.

Biden is the candidate best positioned to deliver that kind of landslide win."
1541,I wouldn't mind him running if he weren't so eager to go negative against the presumptive nominee.  He damaged Clinton in 2016 and he'll try to damage Biden.  His brownshirts are running around now mocking Biden for working from home like any sane person would.
1542,I hate when elections are rigged by the voters so that the person who got the most votes wins the most delegates. Stupid voters.
1543,Lmao okay. Biden‚Äôs now the youngest in the race but that‚Äôs a bad thing!!
1544,People said the same about Clinton. And ‚Äúminorities‚Äù is a really blanket statement. Latinos for example are not nearly as homogenous as African Americans in their voting patterns.

""Got to go to college to get a decent job.""

""College is for finding out who you want to be!""

""Follow your dreams!""

In the real world, a generic liberal arts degree isn't worth much when everyone else your age ALSO has one. Four years in an isolated University town isn't going to teach you shit about yourself. And unless your dream is to starve, make sure you can earn a living before chasing those dreams. 

So of course they are angry. The educational systems failed them, and at great personal cost. 

But that's where my sympathy ends. It's a harsh reality to face, but it *is* the reality. Complaining on the internet won't change anything. Action will."

1558,"You mentioned how, ""this is a public HEALTH issue."" Which requires the public to visit a doctor, which many aren't able to do, this correlating with the price of visiting a doctor. The large majority of the American public aren't able to visit a doctor for a simple test. If Universal Healthcare was around, we would be able to have no fear, or worry how we will pay for a test which will let me know, if I need to further any treatments...which will also cost, out of pocket money, if they aren't insured (ex: contractors, small business, and etc.)...and the majority of Americans are uninsured."

I disagree. He did better in every debate since NV. And why does this upset people? For one a prolongued primary takes away funding from the GE and right now there is actually something more important going on than this primary.

I disagree with you as to why he didn't, but me showing you a poll that *some* people agree with me and not you doesn't actually make you wrong."
1582,"Not sure about the enforcement mechanism, but a tax on carbon emissions will more than nudge the companies in the right direction.

Not sure if he‚Äôs including this but most economists recommend the carbon tax to increase by about 5 to 8% per year, so the price of emitting would double every 12 years or so.

That is something thats actually far dumber than voting for Trump because you're a conservative and he will do what you want for the country - thats voting against what you believe in, just because your favorite lost and someone you personally dislike got the nomination. Would Hillary have won if they voted for her? Theres no way of knowing that, but its despicable nonetheless."

1591,"Makes sense.  Bernie has a bad record on gun control. He voted against the 1993 Brady Bill that imposed mandatory background checks and waiting periods for gun purchases.  And he also supported a 2005 federal law that shielded gun manufacturers, distributors and dealers from civil liability for mass shootings."
1592,"I really thought this was going to be a think piece designed to get Bernie supporters to regroup for the next election but listen to it...

A Trump presidency, worst case means I'm getting deported to Mexico because my grandpa is from South America. But like...

I don't know what to do, they're getting ready to
 die for this."
1593,"I feel you and had to leave my candidate when she dropped out (Harris) and my next who is still in (Klobuchar). It's very important for me to have a woman President. But the reality is it's kind of him or Sanders now. I think Biden was actually more open about supporting marriage equality (contrary to Obama when he was his VP) and ahead of Hillary too. I feel like he'll basically be an Obama or Hillary as his views are very similar. How many of us would have given anything for a Biden presidency on 11/9/16? I look at it as how would I fell if I didn't support the leading non-Sanders candidate at this point were Trump to win again. In that context, a Biden presidency would be amazing! Sure I have concerns about his age and cognitive ability, but compared to Trump he's a brainiac Olympian."
1594,"I disagree. You may think they have similar style and they‚Äôll have similar effects on their respective parties‚Äô establishments, but you have to admit Trump and Sanders have radically different agendas. If it came down to it I‚Äôd much rather the White House be occupied by someone trying to give my parents healthcare than someone trying to deport my friends. The fact that you can ignore this difference is a little scary"
1595,"What reasons are those? I‚Äôm legitimately curious (since being transgender, forgive me if I‚Äôm wrong, should only affect one‚Äôs views on trans issues, not fiscal policy, foreign policy, etc.)"
1596,Any states still counting?
1597,"Consider me in that group.  I just assumed I would go back to Bernie if Pete ever dropped out, but they were just so damn nasty and Bernie did nothing to make me think he doesn't give it all a nod and a wink behind the scenes.  


The ends don't justify the means if it requires hate and vitriol."
1598,Omg the world doesn't deserve someone as kind as you! This makes me feel better. :)
1599,Sanders needs dropout now and back Biden.
1600,"Before people downvote this person's comment: as a Biden supporter, I just want to say that this is a valid question regardless of which camp it came from and would serve as good points of discussion. I, too, would like to hear some thoughts. These types of questions are what make great candidates even better."
1601,"&gt;why are you voting for Joe who says that he will veto medicare for all 

Joe didn't actually say that. I'd suggest watching the interview with Lawrence O'Donnell yourself. 

&gt; while Bernie wants to make medicare for all possible also free college,cancel student debts etc.. 

In the US the President does not have the power to do any of those things. They must be proposed and voted on in Congress. 

Sanders currently has 14 Senate co-sponsors for Medicare for All and zero to two for his other signature proposals you mentioned. He needs 50 or 60 to pass them, depending on what happens with the filibuster and whether a bill can be passed through the budget reconciliation process.

The chances of him getting those votes for any of those proposals are one in a million. It's not even a matter of him getting Republicans on board -- a majority of Democratic members of Congress don't even agree with his proposals. And Sanders is notoriously terrible at building coalitions and convincing people to support his proposals, which is why in thirty years in Congress he has only enacted one actual substantive bill into law -- one which was not particularly progressive. 

Joe, meanwhile, has a very productive track record at getting his legislative agenda accomplished, both as a Senator and as Vice President. His proposals have the support of most Democratic members of congress and his strong working relationships with his fellow Democrats (and even some Republicans) make it far more likely he'd be able to progress his agenda. One needs only to look at the sheer number of endorsements Biden has received from Senators and Representatives vs the paltry few for Sanders to confirm this.

As for Biden's actual agenda:

Welcome to uncle Joe‚Äôs No Malarkey Zone ‚Ñ¢

We got:

$15 minimum wage

400Bn to renewables and nuclear over 10 years

100Bn to high speed rail because Amtrak is cool

A carbon tax, which most economists agree is a better course forward than more regulation

A repeal to citizens united

A repeal of right to work legislation, which weakens union power

A moratorium on deportations

Universal pre k

Universal community college and trade school

A student loan financing system whereby someone gets college for free but pays back 5% of their income over 25,000 per year for a max of 20 years or until they pay back 150,000

Price control on inelastic drugs like insulin

Allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices

A public option that guarantees nobody pays more than 8.5% of their income for health insurance, if you are at less than 150% of the poverty line it‚Äôs free

Decriminalized weed and expungement of convictions

Increased funding for mental health and addiction services

Repeal of trump tax cuts and further tax increases on the wealthy

Ending cash bail, the death penalty, and private prisons."
1602,"Progressives aren't the type to shut up and vote for the lesser of two evils when we are told to, especially when that candidate doesnt have our interests at heart. And after being burned two primaries in a row, I can see most checking out in the general. Biden is not going to beat Trump with no Progressive/independent/youth support, which kind of kills his electability claim."
1603,The ESS community has itself begun to get unnecessarily toxic. I like(d) it as a place to see others‚Äô venting  but at a certain point some posts become obnoxious gloating.
1604,"Same. Im disappointed that Biden will be the nominee, but Sanders supporters being excited to harass people online but not excited to actually go vote has soured me on Sanders, as well as his Joe Rogan ad. Regardless, I already voted on Super Tuesday, so I'm just waiting for the general election shit show. In the meantime, I want to work with anyone on the Left to actually get shit done."
1605,"&gt;but it‚Äôs seriously difficult to overstate what an overwhelming favorite Hickenlooper is for the nomination.

So which primary candidates do need money then?"
1606,"Most of my friends are online, even the ones in town, so not much is different there.  I'm talking to my parents on the phone a lot more than normal.  Big Biden fans in VA.

My best friend(who lives way up north) asked me to help his mom out after his dad had a stroke, and I've been going over there a couple times a week since last september to give her a hand, but mostly to listen to her talk about stuff.  Her husband's nursing home has been on lockdown since last week, so she hasn't been able to see him.  She seemed really down when I told her we'd have to spread these visits out more."

1634,Lmfao
1635,"Same!

I also believe that Warren will do the same thing she did in 2016 and let Joe know she'll be a pain in the ass if he doesn't nominate progressive candidates for the CFPB and other financial protection jobs.

I just love that I can trust Biden to listen to those around him, learn from his mistakes, and put the right people on the right positions (with Warren's advice, of course).

I really hope he chooses Abrams as his VP, cause I cannot wait to vote for her for president."
1636,"Looking like he'll use the whole down ballot and keeping the house as a signal to vote for someone other than Bernie. If he does endorse Joe it won't be tonight, maybe after Tuesday."

1640,What would i despair about? All latest news i can see on actual media outlets is his response to covid-19. I'm guessing in one of the places exclusively trying to target Joe with propaganda some new allegation had popped up that was so ridiculous not even controversy-hungry media picked it up? I'm actually so glad that in spite of remaining in touch with US media i have not even heard of this before that post.

1644,"I hope you don't mind, I'm copying some comments I made to another Pete supporter 2 days ago. I voted for Biden on Friday because I could tell that's where my vote was needed in my state. It's been a rough primary for me, but I feel üíØ certain in my vote. 

:When he speaks like he did yesterday at the townhall, his compassion shines through. You can't help but feel empathy towards him, and feel his empathy towards others. The best qualities about Joe are not exactly exciting, but still powerful. His personal story is powerful. His level of experience is comforting, stabilizing. His empathy is powerful. I teared up at his open letter to the rape victim at the center of the Brock Turner rape case. It was extremely compassionate and validating. I love that he embraced gay marriage before the Obama administration ""evolved"" on it. He is funny- if sometimes unintentionally. And you know, he has a nice smile üòÇ. The right VP could help add energy to the campaign. But it will be important that they sync well together, and embrace a shared vision and campaign. The benefits of someone who is not overwhelming with charisma is that he can help lift up other races in the country. Democrats are pretty stupid in that many generally act like the president is the only office that matters. This started to change in 2018. I would love for Biden to get in and lift up senate candidates, congressional candidates, STATE REPRESENTATIVE candidates. I can think of two amazing candidates in Texas who could be competitive if their community knew about them, but they are in such expensive, gerrymandered districts with such little $ that it is difficult. If his campaign is smart they will find these candidates, visit their cities and campaign with them in their community. That helps create an exciting campaign that is not based on one personality."
1645,"Bernie seems pretty effed in Michigan:


‚ÄúPer the Michigan Secretary of State's office: 24,109 spoiled ballot requests as of 2p.m. today. That allows people to have their vote scrapped and vote for a new candidate.

1654,"Honestly, yeah, maybe so. Most gun owners are not ""gun people"". And I think most gun owners are okay with sensible things like expanded background checks, things that don't interfere with their rights (and look, I'm well aware that there is a very good historical argument that the NRA's stance is not historical at all when it comes to the individual right to bear arms, but as a resident of Kentucky, lemme say that horse is out of the barn.) 

The NRA is and has been crazy alarmist about any and all Democrats, labeling us all as gun grabbers. Joe not being afraid to push back to a guy's face is authentic and real, and might play well to people who aren't crazy alarmists, which is the - dare I say it - silent majority of gun owners."
1655,The primary is run by the party where they have control over everything and can play all the little games they want. There‚Äôs not going to be any endorsing and directing of delegates in the general election. People vote for the person the tv tells them to.

1664,"Here's one that may convince folks who, like me, consider LGBTQ laws one of their priorities: Joe Biden is the only candidate who while discussing Russia paid serious attention to the issue that is almost never talked about. When we talk Russia, we start getting into the 2016 election meddling business, we most certainly talk a lot about how Putin is a dictator, how his relationship with Trump is disturbing, but have you ever heard this being discussed on the debate stage? 

  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-gay\_purges\_in\_Chechnya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-gay_purges_in_Chechnya) 

Quite frankly it's deplorable we do not talk about it. But Biden is the only candidate i am aware of that had adressed this with due seriousness and attention and in this he is unique. That's pretty big for anyone who cares about LGBTQ laws."
1665,"Sorry- but anecdotes aren‚Äôt representative of reality either. Just because you know several people locally to you doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs how the millions of other people in any of the other 49 states feel.

Florida has a law that anyone who drops out after.....god, sometime in December, stays on the ballot, even if they didn't ""suspend"" anything. It's because of how crazy early we send out mail-in ballots here."
1670,"&gt;Joe Walsh, the Illinois ex-Congressman who recently attempted to challenge Trump in the GOP primary, predicted that Trump's disastrous speech and Biden's response would be remembered as an inflection point which boosted the former VP's chances of occupying the Oval Office at this time next year.

And we'll have an occupant that he won't claim is a Kenyan.  Walsh is trying to be a statesman, but he was pulling the birth certificate BS one short year ago.  Don't forget what trash Walsh is."
1671,"One very important statistic is the gain:deficit ratio, that is the number of delegates a candidate has just one in the last round (either last ballot at a convention, or the most recent set of primaries once the parties started having primaries to choose delegates. 

&amp;#x200B;

In all the conventions involving the RNC, and in all the ones involving the DNC after the DNC went to majority rule (that is didn't require 2/3 of the votes at a convention), the first candidate to get a G/D ratio of 0.36 or greater went on to nomination.

&amp;#x200B;

I posted a tweet the other day with Biden who was at 1180 at the time with some of 3/17 delegates undecided, as well as some from CA and CO and a few others, and he was almost at 0.36.

&amp;#x200B;

With the updated numbers, he is now above 0.36, and according to theory, will be the next nominee.

He has a realistic plan on universal healthcare (as opposed to Bernie's, which is far to the left of every country in the world), a realistic plan on climate change, etc. 

Bernie also supports policies that are patently insane to me - he's just as much of a protectionist as Donald Trump is, for example. 

I really wish we had an option that wasn't nearly 80 years old but of the two I'll take the one who got VAWA passed and personally accelerated the legalization of gay marriage over the one who has passed 3 bills ever and whose supporters spent months calling Pete Buttigieg 'not gay enough'."

""If Biden and his son were corrupt, wouldn't they have wanted to keep the corrupt prosecutor instead of replacing him with an honest one?

How is getting rid of that prosecutor so sketchy when everyone, including democrats, Republicans and other countries wanted this guy gone?. Who wanted him to stay exactly?

The fact is people pushing this nonsense wont be able to answer any questions on this."
1712,"I love how people here accuse Sanders supporters of being the most hateful group of supporters. Obviously there are hateful people on his side, but what you just said is just as hateful as the things many of them say and it isn‚Äôt helping anybody. Bernie may not align with your views but he is staying in this to push the agenda that he believes will help people and to call him pathetic for doing that is not helping anyone"

1723,"As a rock-solid Pete supporter for the past full year, I still do not get the idea that Pete hasn‚Äôt the experience necessary to be POTUS.  There have been several prominent presidents in the past with very limited Washington experience‚Äîone that immediately comes to mind is Obama‚Äîand Pete has said, repeatedly, that the job could be an extrapolation of what he did for eight years, that perhaps someone who successfully brought a city back from the brink is exactly the change we needed, plus, unlike Trump‚Äôs dumpster fire, Pete‚Äôs plan was always to pick the best, the smartest, the appropriate people to surround and advise him to make the best possible decisions for the American public.  Had to get that rant off my chest, but, that being said, I do not for one minute think that a president Sanders would be able to get anything at all accomplished, going back to Washington with both fists in the air and a grimace on his face, insisting on turning everything inside out... basically what Trump has done.  I can appreciate the respectful relationship I saw for months between Pete and Joe, and Pete‚Äôs endorsement didn‚Äôt really surprise me, even as far back as New Hampshire, but I‚Äôm still not sure I‚Äôm even going to the polls next week, now that my guy is out.  I‚Äôm 66 years old and have never seen a candidate like Pete, been this energized about politics, or ever donated to or planted yard signs for a candidate for president.  My health is morphing to the point that I may not be around in eight or twelve years to see Pete run again, so if Biden wins, it would at least be good to see Joe understand how inclusive, wide-reaching, and needed Pete‚Äôs Douglass Plan is (I‚Äôm an old white fart, by the way), and figure out a way to get Pete to help him implement it."
1724,"I‚Äôm fully aware of that. At the end of the day it‚Äôs a meme. Just trying to laugh a little while showing the strength and dependency of the moderate base. Once the field thinned out, Biden‚Äôs job got much easier."

1727,"Yeah it's too bad and hurts every day people more than we think because scammed people are not as likely to give to causes in the future. I think I sent $5 to one of his fundraisers before I learned of his past. Deray said something so true in that article about Shaun King.. the person who paints your house before he steals your car has still committed theft.


&gt;I tried previously to engage offline to resolve these tensions, but his behaviors did not change. There is a formula that he employs when people ask questions or highlight contradictions: issue an unconditional denial, attack the character of the person asking questions, argue that white supremacists are attacking him or his family, respond only to the least salient of all points raised, then issue a statement akin to an apology.

&gt;But he does not often answer any of the questions or offer any resolution of contradictions raised, but instead, deflects. What‚Äôs more, he often bullies and intimidates those who ask questions at all, turning his ire especially at Black women, attempting to scare inquirers into silence.


&gt;When asked about the repeated organizations and lack of transparency on funding, he has replied noting that ‚Äúfailure is not fraud,‚Äù as if to suggest that questions raised do not warrant serious responses simply because he may have been an ineffective leader. But at a point, those who attempt to lead but consistently demonstrate that they cannot effectively lead should stop. We have reached that point with Shaun."

1732,Hey if you tell people what they want to hear they will slurp it up like the gospel. The fact is the Republican Party was forced to go all in on this administration and it‚Äôs exposed them for what they really are and I‚Äôm thankful for it. This is the end of the GOP (hopefully).

1734," 

There is,  of course, diversity of opinion within any group of voters. But the  collective role played by African American voters in this election has  been particularly decisive. It was black voters ‚Äî first in South  Carolina and then in Virginia, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina and  Alabama ‚Äî who saved Biden‚Äôs candidacy, saved the possibility of a  center-left Democratic Party and saved the hope that U.S. politics can  consist of something more than anger and grievance.

Some African American support for Biden is based on familiarity. When people in crowds chant, ‚Äú[We know Joe!](https://twitter.com/Timodc/status/1234916762375712768),‚Äù  they are saying they have seen his empathy and decency demonstrated  over decades. That type of trust cannot be bought with paid advertising.

But  apart from affection for Biden, African American voters have a  reputation for favoring center-left, establishment candidates over  liberal alternatives. They tend to view the stakes of certain political  results ‚Äî such as the reelection of a president who feeds racism as a  political strategy ‚Äî as very high. And their broad reaction to this  heightened sense of risk is pragmatism in avoiding destructive outcomes.  This is a healthy political instinct."
1735,Touch√©. Had forgotten Baker was still governor.
1736,I agree with your last paragraph but that isn‚Äôt how people see it for some reason. I always thought it was weird yang never had a moment. All the other decent candidates had their moment except for yang in my opinion.

Or you just another Democrat hypocrite moron? 
Or maybe it's just that you think the only ""normal"" people are moderate democrats? Yes, that probably it, and you still have no idea why the moderates can't win an election against some moron president in office. Not only are you an idiot, you're a hypocrite.

She can endorse who she wants, but her endorsing Joe holds no sway with me and gives no pleasure. I honestly think there's a case to be made that he should reject the endorsement, or at least ignore it.

I'm completely open to Gabbard *supporters* coming here and participating in politics. But when they voice a soft stance toward Assad, or when they support discrimination *by statute* against Muslims in India, they are no longer welcome in my view.

So if they happened to support Gabbard for whatever acceptable reason, sure, totally welcome. But her most troubling *stances* are not welcome. At least for me."

1839,"Who could possibly argue that Bernie wasn‚Äôt heard? He‚Äôs run a strong, vocal campaign two elections in a row. Does he have the *right* to stay in until the convention? Of course he does. He has the right to bash Biden, run as a third party candidate, start a SuperPAC, or go back to Vermont and start a bed and breakfast. If he stays for much longer though, especially after the delegate math gets to the point where securing the nomination becomes a statistical impossibility, that starts to suggest that he views spreading his own message as being more important than actually defeating Trump, which would make any future effort he might make to get his own supporters on board with Biden seem disingenuous."
1840,Wake me up when *Steve* Gutenberg endorses Biden.
1841,It‚Äôs definitely tone deafness. That‚Äôs like saying Hitler created a thriving economy. Is it true? Perhaps. Would you praise Hitler for this act? No. It doesn‚Äôt undo the millions of people who he killed. You definitely wouldn‚Äôt tell a Jewish person this because they suffered through the tragedy. It‚Äôs a terrible thing to say no matter what. He‚Äôs putting being ‚Äútechnically right‚Äù over everything.
1842,Biden is the manliest of old men. He‚Äôs literally Captain America when he got old in End Game. Google it. If you don‚Äôt see appeal in that your sense of charisma might be dead.
1843,Get better or get out.

1848,"&gt;We can worry about the arrogant billionaire tomorrow.

Which one of the three now?"
1849,"What‚Äôs the difference between spending decades advocating and trying to pass racist policies and eight years of having a black man as a boss? Seems a bit weighted in one direction there and it doesn‚Äôt look good.

And ‚Äòanother way to spin this‚Äô is he‚Äôs a racist man whose willing to work for a black man if it means being Vice President of the United States. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fair, but if we‚Äôre gonna start listing options that‚Äôs about 40% as unfair as this could be portrayed. 

Talking about spin isn‚Äôt proving something wrong, more just saying there are optional truths you can choose. Once you say there are options, some folks are gonna get real mean. I think certain Trump voters prove this pretty well by choosing not to believe reality and instead blaming everything on whatever minority they can. 

I prefer to rely on verifiable facts. Biden worked with racists and it built his power. Biden warned against desegregation creating a ‚Äòracial jungle‚Äô. Biden just this week promised a black cancer survivor he‚Äôd speak with her after an event about his housing plan after she explained she‚Äôd been evicted after her second cancer diagnosis. He left immediately after and his staff refused to setup a meeting with him after hearing him say to the entire crowd he promised to meet with her. 

None of this looks good. It looks a lot like he expects the African American vote but isn‚Äôt willing to do more than say he had a black boss once."
1850,"I'd say a high school hockey team had a better chance of beating the 1980 Russian hockey team than Bernie has at beating Biden. Hell, a team of people who had never played and just randomly hit the puck probably do too.

He hasn't ""made it this far"". He's doing worse than in 2016 and just riding the name recognition and spending far more money than anyone else to eake out a series of losses."
1851,It‚Äôs a valid statement - no offense taken at all!
1852,I feel this. üëçüèº
1853,There are many people making up false things about Sanders. So there are conspiracies working against Sanders.
1854,God those replies. Hurr durr just like John Kerry.  Yeah let's start with a less popular candidate. That will help.
1855,"&gt;I don't think the bar could be much lower here

Again I'll point out that this is often what happens in elections, regardless of whether you like it or not. We don't just vote on policy. Character is very important. That's how it is. 

I also believe that Biden's policies are superior to that of Sanders. I don't think he is the 'safe option' - I think he is the better option. I wouldn't dismiss all voters' preferences for Biden by saying they think he is safe. Some of us think he is better."

1860,"Would you be able to name an issue, Mr. Biden has spoken of and how he plans to deal with said issue, which shows he is a progressive?"
1861,Anyone who permits Trump to stay in office because Joe made political decisions they dislike *a really long time ago* probably isn't worth spending time convincing.
1862,"I‚Äôm a progressive and I will be voting for a progressive. Me and at least 10,000,000 other progressives. 

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm a Bernie bro, it‚Äôs that the Democratic Party doesn‚Äôt deserve my vote. I will not relinquish my leverage. I wouldn‚Äôt vote for a non progressive candidate until Medicare for all is on the table. 

I‚Äôm not yelling, or being stupid, or stubborn. I could never be ok with voting for someone who has advocated for cuts to social security, veteran benefits, and any other social benefit that is that important. I could not, in good conscience, vote for someone who doesn‚Äôt believe that medical care is a right. 
I could never vote for a person who worked for an administration that may have or has removed children from their parents for seeking refugee status I. This country.

Joe will loose to Trump. Not because ten million progressives are going to vote for Joe, but because the DNC can‚Äôt see they have to make concessions to make this country better to win the progressive vote."
1863,"Unwilling to give it clicks, but i bet he's mostly upset he will not be at the forefront of these horse-trades and deals.

Realistically, he won't align with mr.sanders, and he'd be seen as weak for aligning with warren. üòì"
1864,"You know who‚Äôs a major funding source for the Democratic Party? LGBTQ voters. Specifically the ones who backed Pete from early on. What about us? We‚Äôre the only minority in this country without federal laws protecting us from discrimination. We‚Äôre targeted globally for persecution. 

I‚Äôm tired of us being erased from the conversation simply because we don‚Äôt fit a certain vocal group of woke twitter warriors definition of ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù. Almost Every person being suggested as VP fizzled out early because of lack of support or isn‚Äôt even vetted. Pete came in 3rd, and has the highest favorability rating of any candidate and that‚Äôs including Joe. 

Even when talking about cabinet positions, Pete‚Äôs erased because he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot experienced‚Äù. I‚Äôm just tired of it. I didn‚Äôt back Joe just to have him be VA secretary or HUD, or Trade representative, something that‚Äôs either deadend, invisible, or a landmine for scandals. And frankly, if he doesn‚Äôt get something significant, I‚Äôll feel betrayed."
1865,"So during the debate, Joe said he ""wanted someone who is prepared to be president"" on day 1. He actually said this very thing about Harris not long ago (I think when she endorsed). That makes me think it's going to be her."
1866,Isn't that what was said in 2016 and Trump still won? Biden's health is not the greatest and Trump will use that against him. The DNC/Establishment owns most of old media (Not Fox) and has not been telling the full story of what is going on with Biden. Most of those people are the voters who are voting for Biden.

""Biden's campaign told POLITICO that in his remarks on the recording, he was simply ""restating his cannabis policy,"" which includes eliminating criminal penalties linked to marijuana, erasing marijuana-related criminal records and ""letting states set their own policies regarding legalization of recreational marijuana while further effort is made to study the effects of cannabis use.""

What i meant was a subclass of semi-automatic weapons, not all semi-automatic weapons. The appropriate term is ""assault weapons"". The text quoted by me goes in detail to answer your question about features. Specifically

 "" Such military features clearly distinguish assault weapons from standard sporting firearms; these features are what enable shooters to fire many rounds quickly and accurately, with or without the use of sights, while retaining control of the weapon. For this reason, assault weapons are frequently the guns of choice for individuals who carry out horrific public attacks ""

Possible motive? President Trump has refused to use a wartime law to require major manufacturers to make vital equipment to combat the new coronavirus, reportedly after corporations successfully lobbied his top adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

Another possible reason: Thus far, the Trump Organization, run by the president‚Äôs adult sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., have closed properties in Doral, Florida, Las Vegas, Ireland, Scotland, Bedminster, New Jersey, and Palm Beach, Florida, the home of Mar-a-Lago. According to the Post, those hotels and clubs represent six of Trump‚Äôs top revenue-producing businesses, bringing in about a collective $174 million per year, or $478,000 per day.

1893,Thanks for the response.  I like that last point.  Useful perspective.
1894,It speaks volumes of Bernie that he didn't stay to thank the moderators for their work.
1895,It's time to unite the party and focus on getting Trump the HELL out of office in Novemer.
1896,i didn't know Jill Biden had an Ed.D.
1897,"After ST, Obama doesn't need to endorse until there is a undisputed nominee. He can remain impartial still."
1898,It shows the ‚Äúcharacter not recognized by device‚Äù question mark in box for me
1899,I'm surprised more states aren't using this to push for vote-by-mail.
1900,Would it be safe to say that the OP does not in fact believe women?
1901,"I know it‚Äôs hard to resist gloating, but we‚Äôre better than that. The candidate of unity and healing. We can‚Äôt let this sub turn into a bastion of division between blue voters."
1902,"It will not be surprising if biden pulls a clinton 2016, just pathetic. Bunch of people keep making the same mistakes"
1903,The majority of polls have them in a statistical tie in Texas. It's definitely going to be contested this year.
1904,Catching 'Rona &lt; M4A
1905,So a polling account on Twitter posts hypothetical tickets vs Trump and all Bernie supporters quickly shoot it down despite Biden being ahead by a wide margin. They use the same baseless claims about Biden losing. I don't see how Bernie would do any better when he never won over the majority of the party and yet they expect Bernie to be the most competitive in a general election. I used to support Bernie and shit like this grinds my gears. Biden showed he is the most competitive since he actually brought back important voting blocs back into the fold.
1906,"You're right, but they do like energy and tenacity and both of those are her strong suit."
1907,"Would you rather ""lick door knobs in China"" than see Sanders elected? Lol"
1908,You mean he's willing to pretend to adopt it to steal their voters? He could have adopted those policies at any time but didn't until they dropped out.
1909,And 99% in! Aren't straight voting primaries so much better than shifty caucuses?
1910,"God I hope Biden sweeps tomorrow.

That other campaign needs to end."
1911,Biden‚Äôs own president praised some things Castro did. Lol
1912,"Klobuchar:

- Woman to tick off diversity box
- Not only is she from the critical Midwest and Rust Belt region, she's also proven to be quite good at handling purple areas of those parts
- Experience in Senate will help with pushing through legislation
- Moderate enough she won't scare off some moderate Republicans willing to vote for Biden
- I want to see comedic passive-aggressive Buttigieg vs Klobuchar shenanigans in a Biden administration
- Old enough to be experienced, young enough not to have to deal with the ""OK Boomer"" effect"
1913,"You know there has been a lot of talk about a progressive as VP for Biden. But none of a moderate for Bernie. Now you do mention that but I honestly believe that is delusional, that chance that Bernie wold chose someone Like Pete as a VP is just 0. Bernie literally thinks the dem establishment is the enemy. He‚Äôs not gonna chose one for his VP.
I do however think that the dems are more open towards the progressives; which can be seen by the fact that the dnc has upended the entire primary process (less super delegates, more debates, easier access to debates, more transparency asked for by Bernie); and that the ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô candidates have moved to the left on so many issues. So I really wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Biden‚Äôs vp is a progressive. But it won‚Äôt be Bernie, he has burned too many Bridges, warren however? Who knows. Btw Stacey is also a progressive so I‚Äôll still put my money on her."
1914,"I'll hold any judgment until after the results. As of now, these are just speculations from aides and not coming from Bernie himself."
1915,"see, that's the spirit! Still pretty rude about it, but better."
1916,"FDR, Truman, IKE, JFK, LBJ, Carter, Clinton and Obama all tried. Its not the corps who didn't even exist in scale until Clinton that have been the issue but the GOP and GOP voters.  The corps are a by product of the GOP philosophy of market driven instead of federal programs.   Point out one journal that explains the cost of transitions not just the savings post transition.  Then take that cost and multiple by 3.  I say expand what we have, tax the super rich and focus on climate change."
1917,I think you misunderstood. That was the Obama/Biden policy. Trump continued it.
1918,"Doesn't even have to be Russians, just people grandstanding online who won't actually do what they say offline where reddit can't see them."
1919,Lol obviously yes
1920,"Look, this is the official candidate sub.  If you want spicy memes and kvetching about how Bernie killed our dogs, go to r/neoliberal

1924,"The term ""adjustments"" is a euphemism - read the context and you can clearly see what he's getting at."
1925,"Biden has been in most of the back of our minds, just not our preferred. I was in for Pete, but I obviously wanted Biden to do well and would‚Äôve made similar comments."
1926,"Agreed. He basically has, let‚Äôs set our sight a little further!"
1927,Decriminalization is a good first step.  Let's people know that he supports people's rights to use but doesn't force the states to legalize. Most states will follow the lead eventually leading to legalization. It's about baby steps because everyone has different viewpoints and it takes time to get everyone on board.
1928,It's already been mopped.
1929,"You have to break a certain threshold (5% I think) to qualify for that public funding. I do not believe it has happened in modern political history.

Public funding initiatives are happening already in certain localities, I know in the Seattle area they experimented with that idea. I don't think the problem with third parties is their lack of funding, but rather they start on the outside of political alignments where there is no support to begin with. You have to start in the center (similar to Obama) to gain national support, plain and simple. Localities are where third parties should start because political alignments do not correlate necessarily with national views."
1930,"I don't think Trump can hit Joe on SS, seeing as Joe supports expanding it and Trump supports shrinking it. The primaries have proven that the older voters that decide elections haven't really been swayed by Bernie's SS attacks too."
1931,"I like Obama.   But it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm a blind follower willing to overlook our politician‚Äôs faults.  At the end of the day they‚Äôre all just politicians.  They‚Äôre not gods, lol."
1932,The Joegurnaut dosen't stop.
1933,This is some serious malarky
1934,"Obviously do everything we can to get out youth vote, but they‚Äôre not reliable and can‚Äôt be counted on. We need to ideally get crossover votes from republicans"
1935,Please take your conspiracy‚Äôs elsewhere.
1936,Source?
1937,"I feel like I can understand the ""establishment"" point of view a lot better now. When Biden repeatedly (and I do mean *repeatedly*) does better in polls against Trump than Bernie does (even if it's 1 or 2 points better than Trump, that matters a hell of a lot in swing states with straight ticket voting), it makes my blood boil thinking about how the Bernie campaign is risking our potential seat gains by wanting to nominate a more unelectable candidate. Not that Bernie can't win; we really need to win this 2020 general election in a decisive landslide, and it's looking even clearer that Biden is the only candidate left who can do that the best."
1938,"Then what? We get another status quo president, go back to a far right Republican, then get another status quo president right after? When does it end?"
1939,Happy to know you‚Äôve been clean for 7 years brother! You have amazing strength üí™
1940,I really think they did more harm to him than good. They went from idealists to ideologues
1941,"bernie's surrogates literally are filled with russian apologist, not surprised.

I think his latest surrogate is 9/11 truther. This man can't be a president, imagine what kind of people he is going to put in his cabinet."
1942,You misspelled ‚Äútruth‚Äù
1943,"Almost like a republican voted republican, again. Oh my bad sorry I meant to say a republican bored for Joe Biden"
1944,he should be replaced with Clyburn
1945,"The red states could simply pass a law to name their electors. Remember.

Emergency powers do not equal emergency capacity. Laws are on paper. 

The election in November will be fine, but I don't think elections should be delayed."
1946,"On the other hand imo it'll hurt him HARD. That tone only works with diehard progressives -- who are already backing him if they ever get around to voting -- and far right hyperconservatives, who are voting Trump. ""Normal"" average Generic Vanilla Flavor Democrats aren't into that shit, it just makes you sound crazy. 

Actually that's interesting. If there's any strategy to it at all beyond just Bernie being Bernie and good life choices be damned, it could be that they decided to risk alienating Vanilla Flavor Dems in order to double down on trying to get his base mad enough to actually vote. Can't say I think that'll pay off, if it's what he's doing."
1947,"As we Pete supporters like to say, those folks don't follow the Rules of the Road."
1948,"Define the ""establishment"" is it the DNC? The guys who schedule debates? You give them alot more credit then they are due. Each politician is beholden to their constituents. And almost 3 in 4 Americans supported the invasion of Iraq at the outset.

https://news.gallup.com/poll/8038/seventytwo-percent-americans-support-war-against-iraq.aspx"
1949,"The Twitter replies mentioning abortionü§î Republicans are fine allowing felons to buy semi-automatic weapons at gun shows but attack Democrats for not wanting women to die seeking illegal abortions. Make sure to throw this back at them, they don‚Äôt get to claim moral leadership."
1950,Thanks! Really love seeing overturning Citizens United on there
1951,"She got 5th in Iowa after dumping all of her resources there, that‚Äôs not convincing she can win past MN. And with the abuse allegations being very credible, you‚Äôre looking at an unexciting candidate with a guarenteed October surprise.

Not to mention an all white ticket doesn‚Äôt look good."
1952,"One candidate to bind them, and through the primaries, unite them."
1953,"Agreed. I live in mass, a Biden endorsement wouldn't hurt her at all."
1954,I think white and black women might feel leapfrogged
1955,"It's hard to say because it's subjective for everyone. People give different weight to different policies.

For example, to me I think Biden has a climate change plan. But if you asked a Bernie supporter they would say he dosen't have one because they don't see it as grand enough."
1956,"Joe OWNED Bernie. Did you see that part where he was like ""you've got 9 SuperPACs"" and then Bernie was like ""name them"" and then Joe was like ""Oh get out of here."" FUCKING REKT. 

How about when he DESTROYED Bernie when he was like ""I would never cut Social Security,"" but then later he was like ""Ya, i'd cut that shit"". FUCKING DESTROYED REKT TO DEATH OMG BERNIE DROPOUT YOU'RE DONE. 

For real though. Y'all are making your bed, and I can't wait to watch you sleep in it."
1957,"There have been national crises over the past 3 years, it‚Äôs just that most of them were of his making."
1958,Betos debate performance and the media using the ‚Äúhell yes we‚Äôll take your AR-15s‚Äù soundbite was his biggest problem. He was polling decently before that.

1965,Bill Maher is not a white supremacist. What the actual fuck are you high on?
1966,"The fundamental difference is that Clinton behaved divisively.  

The election was hers to lose, yet she called people ""deplorable,"" and ignored her traditional base who were suffering.  She came off as elitist, and was.  It wasn't her positions.  It was her.

That's where Joe Biden is so different.  Hillary hadn't driven a car since the 1990s.  Joe not only drives, but chooses to ride Amtrak.  Joe graciously received both Buttigieg and Klobuchar yesterday.  Beto took him to Whataburger for dinner.

Joe is the real thing.  In an era of the anger and hatred, it's refreshing.  

Pete had to stand up to Sanders about the homophobic attacks the campaign launched against him.  Sanders wouldn't apologize or even acknowledge them.  

There's a reason why Pete is not only supporting Biden, but Joe wants him in his cabinet."
1967,Elaborate.
1968,"Idk. She was ‚Äúfight the fight worth fighting for‚Äù candidates prior to her revision of m4a plan.

And, she was pretty defensive about M4A and deflected the incoming attacks on m4a by making it as something that is tough but worth fighting for. (And added some unnecessary comments involving ‚ÄòRepublican Talking Points‚Äô.)"

1973,"Hillary would have won if she got the 10% of Bernie supporters who voted for Trump in 2016 due to the close margins in the swing states. So, I would be carefully discounting any voters that Biden should definitely try and get on board."

1976,Just dawned on me that I've never seen the plural of soliloquy spelled out before
1977,"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro‚Äôs great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen‚Äôs Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ‚Äúorder‚Äù than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ‚ÄúI agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action‚Äù;"

Don't forget lack of preparation!"
1979,"I haven't heard of the Douglass plan, so I'd like to hear more about it.

Andrew Yang was also on the breakfast club. lol

I believe those guys just wanted anyone other than a white person to be president.

I know one of them really liked Cory Booker.

I don't think he handled well when questioned about the black police firing though.

I'd say Obama is good and bad. He wasn't perfect, but he did bail us out of a recession and is a great speaker.

I disagreed with him on how he bailed out corporate banks vs the people. 

I'd also like for us to move towards cryptocurrency as well and cut our ties with the Saudi's.

Also the situation with Edward Snowden, I would hope we have a president who pardons him.

Yes, he's a whistleblower, but I believe it was necessary in that we understand that our own government is spying on us and Obama did not pardon him.

Overall Pete isn't bad, but disagree with him on some key issues, mainly UBI.

Wasn't he funded by 40 billionaires and multiple SuperPacs as well?

I also don't like that he's ruled out nuclear energy when it comes to climate change.
We should be modeling after France whose healthcare is #1 and they are miles ahead of us in terms of energy and nuclear technology. Shutting down power plants would cause fracking and also make us rely more on coal."
1980,He needs to leave by May if voting follows the current projections.   Bernie doesn't have much of a case this time for a contested convention.   He can win more contests but Biden is winning by larger margins in bigger states and Bernie if winning only does it by a slim margin.
1981,"I've yet to be see one of these viral clips that actually makes him look bad aside from ones clearly taken out of context.

As for debates, Biden only has issues in these primary ones with strict time limits and people he doesn't actually dislike. Check out his old debate with Ryan if you want to see what he's capable of when he has full ability to tear someone apart."

1995,You're going to lose to trump bc you're not addressing the concerns of the lower middle class and you clearly do not care to at all.
1996,"It's not fair, but....the media and misogyny (and ""likeability"") played a big part. The media tears down everyone, but were particularly harsh on Clinton. There was literally a running special on two different major TV news shows when she had pneumonia, and barely a blip when Bernie fell in the shower...the heart attack only became a thing when he didn't release all his records. People brought up her age all the time, even though Biden and Bernie are several years older, but some journalists call it ageism when it comes to the men. Meanwhile, part of the media literally calls him ""Uncle"" Joe and he has a reputation of being gaffe prone but with a gold heart. 

I was not a fan of Hillary, but she got a very raw deal. The thing to remember is that Hillary also won the popular vote by 3 million, and only lost the electoral college by around 80 thousand in swing states. She also ""won"" the working class over Trump in general, but not specifically WWC. She was very strong with AA voters, but Biden has almost the same numbers with AA voters and is carrying not just the working class...but particularly the white working class guys in the rust belt. He's beating Bernie, even. A lot of people in Michigan also think well of him for the auto bailout, and there are signs Michigan was going to flip blue no matter what anyway (the Gov. crushed her GOP opponent)....but with Joe it definitely will. 

So in that sense, he has two areas where he's stronger than her (white working class voters, particularly men, and the media/likeability). 

The last one is NC and FL....NC demographically is becoming more Dem friendly (young people moved for tech, and a large population of Black voters) and Obama won it in '08. It looks like Thom Tillis will be unseated by a Democrat in the senate. Lastly, he's always polled in FL much higher than Clinton which means he starts off at an advantage for the general...Plus, former felons were given back their right to vote in Florida...which means there are over a million new voters. Former prisoners, sadly, are disproportionately Black...and Black men and women tend to almost always vote for Democrats. Even if only 40 thousand vote, that could make a world of difference as FL can be razor thin. Bill Nelson lost his senate seat in 2018 to a Republican by only 10 thousand votes."

Do a town hall instead of a debate... Biden performs much better at town halls."

2014,Hey I always want more Joe.  The more he speaks the more I like him.
2015,"&gt;As for a jobs guarantee, I'm genuinely not sure how you think it's socialist. Could you explain?

In vague terms, I remember encountering that Soviets were extremely focused on eliminating unemployment. If you can't keep proletariat busy, what are you good for as a socialist government?

[https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/pre1998/1992-806-36-2-Moskoff.pdf](https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/pre1998/1992-806-36-2-Moskoff.pdf)

This article doesn't directly explain it but it shows Soviets commitment to ensuring jobs.

I recall this point similarly being made about Yugoslavia, maximizing productivity by making up jobs and fuzzying the numbers, and with Chinese having people build endless roads and buildings in past decade or so to combat unemployment.

edit: Maybe I was a bit unclear, when I say staple I mean in practical terms. Right to work is a general human right, but socialist regimes seemed dedicated on fulfilling that right, even when there's no justification for it. Like building roads and buildings that will sit unused.

&amp;#x200B;

But to further expand this specific issue, why I think it's bad... specifically job guarantee combined with fair (15 $/h) minimum wage.

I believe private sector is more than able to create jobs if there is a need for them. But if private sector can't do so, government is supposed to guarantee jobs for everyone that wants to work, even if there's no demand for their specific set of skills? All while ""slowly"" killing off non-renewables industry.

It causes excess workforce in public sector which is then supposed to be funded by private sector via taxes. If private sector didn't manage to create these jobs, what are these people actually doing to be productive? Even if they are productive at one point, how long will they stay productive?

Think [this video](https://youtu.be/n-mUZRP-fpo?t=68) demonstrates nicely how it looks in practice.

If you have unproductive useless government jobs where you can't reduce wages or cut hours you're just wasting money and probably creating inflation. And going by experience from my country (and probably many others), once you land a government job, you're set for life ([Iron rice bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_rice_bowl)). So you're set for life on a useless government job paying at least 15$ per hour.

Additionally, it gives government more and more power because it directly employs people who vote for it. And people working useless dead-end jobs will keep voting for their socialist government because they are directly dependent on it.

My city Zagreb (in a post-socialist country of Croatia) has a same corrupt mayor for 20 years because of this, people vote for him because he directly employs them or their family members and friends and decides on their paychecks. Dude was even re-elected after returning from prison. He's on his 6th term at the moment while being prosecuted again. He knows how this stuff works, in Yugoslavia he was member of the party.

All of these measures just help government tighten its grip."
2016,"Enemies are friends in reverse.  They'll reveal things about yourself that you don't like.  You've gone from saying that data is biased to I'm being unkind.  I'm not saying you're dumb or anything like that.  You're moving goalposts.

Between Biden and Bernie, Biden is the best shot we have at getting the Senate back.  Bernie in the hot seat will ensure McConnell is still majority leader, and our 2018 gains in the house will recede.  I'd much rather win, and win big enough to get our nation back on track."
2017,"clears up the line for election day.  A lot of people will just drive by and if the line is too long will skip it.  There are a lot of mildly interested voters that won't wait hours in line.

The problem with inheritance taxes is that they're too susceptible to disinformation.  People deal with them maybe once or twice in their lifetimes.

2059,"&gt;Bernie's most aggressive supporters are doing Trump's work for him

Look I'm a Bernie supporter, but a great deal of those people are *actual* Trump trolls. If you've ever gone to the comment sections on Breitbart, the vitriol and talking points on there are almost identical to what you see on twitter from those kinds of ""Bernie bros"", it's shocking really. And most of the time when you click on their handle, they have some sort of Pro-Trump wording in their bio.

That said there's trolls who support every candidate. I don't assume every Biden supporter is an ignorant asshole if I happen to run into a single one on twitter, and you shouldn't assume the same for Bernie supporters.

&gt;Yet it is by Sanders since he refuses to distance himself from any supporters.

He's already disavowed this behavior multiple times."
2060,Megabiden is getting strongerrrrrr!!!
2061,"I had to make this exact pivot in 2016. Until Thursday, I was a Warren Democrat in this cycle.

Biden wasn‚Äôt my 1st, 2nd, or 3rd choice. However, he is much more progressive now than people give him credit for. He builds coalitions, people like him and want to work with him, he has effectively passed progressive legislation, and he has the trust of a majority of Black voters who are among those who stand to lose the most if Trump wins.

And I think Biden stands the best chance of flipping the Senate and keeping the House.

I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre on the team. Let‚Äôs fight hard together as progressives within the Biden camp!"

&gt;Here's a stat for you... Joe Biden won the *late deciders* (last few days)... *in Vermont.*

Fun fact:

The margin in Vermont was Sanders +28.7. The margin in Virginia (where [Sanders was up by 9 points](https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/2/26/sanders-ahead-in-virginia-and-colorado) in late February) ended up being Biden +30.2. Biden won Virginia by a greater margin than Sanders won in his own home state.

Biden received more votes in Virginia in 2020 than Sanders and Clinton combined in 2016."

2072,"Biden's strategy is pretty simple.

First, the reasons why we lost in 2016 was losing the white rural working class, low democrat turnout and high republican turnout.

Biden, so far has got high democrat turnout and because he is generally liked and Hillary was so hated it makes it difficult for Trump to get as high Republican turnout.

Based off of the midterms, 2016 and polling, Democrats massively outnumber Republicans but Clinton was a bad candidate.

Biden is trying to get 2 kinds of voters.  The first one is the conservative suburbanite who doesn't like Trump but voted for him in 2016 because he was GOP.  These are the ones that have partially already turned in 2018 and are causing record high turnout in suburban areas this primary season.  These alone along with decent turnout wins Biden the election.  Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania (or NC or AZ).

Trump is not trying to gain any new voters and any democrats who didn't like Obama are already gone to Trump so there is no risk of losing more voters as Trump has spent the last 4 years playing to his base.

Biden polls well with working calls white rural voters and suburban voters which reduces Republican turnout and means many will be less likely to vote because if they don't love Trump (many don't) because Biden is liked, they won't vote against Biden either.

That is basically the road to victory, winning key swing states through gains in the suburban population.  Biden does very well with older voters and this should help him eat into Trump's older base.  Biden has always been popular with Boomers, even when they were young, so they trust him and will be more likely to vote for him than vote for Hillary.

Democrats lost cause of bad strategy and a bad candidate last time.  Biden's strategy has been working and he has good fundamentals for a candidate which is likable and authentic."

1. ""Biden has dementia"" 

1. Bernie or Bust movement

2099,"I‚Äôm not going to attack his supporters, but can I politely point out why Biden‚Äôs foreign policy is so much better?"
2100,That's not true. He had stated his plans in detail from the very beginning.
2101,"It comes down to this: Attitude reflects leadership. Pete made a proactive point of establishing Rules of the Road as guidance for campaign staff and supporters alike. You could see the effect of that leadership daily in the subreddit and it was broadly said that Pete supporters exemplified those ROTR.

If the Sanders campaign cared about those same values, they could be setting an example and leading on it. Instead they wore t-shirts for their wine cave website. It comes from the top, and it is hugely disappointing.

I supported Sanders in 2016 but in this election leadership, empathy and setting a positive example matters - we can't have unity without it. The line that the toxic supporters MAY not be real or numerous or representative is a weak defense that borders on gaslighting.

So anyway, I am leaning towards Biden tomorrow and appreciate this thread."
2102,"It sounds like Bernie is going to refuse to drop out until June again. He really wants Trump to win again together back at the Dems for being more popular than he is.

Feels like high school and not at all a grown adult."

Yes, some people will be saved, that's why I'm voting for Biden (IF he makes it to the general), to save some lives. But I voted for Bernie to save ALL preventable suffering and death. Anyone that didn't vote for Bernie in the primary doesn't have a standing talking about saving lives. Anyone that didn't vote for Bernie in the primary doesn't care about ALL Americans health."

2110,"Lines are oppression now, shitlord.

God I hope Biden's victory shuts the far left up (at least temporarily).  A lot of their ""ideas"" are electorally toxic and the left's bad ideas will be tied to moderates by less than scrupulous actors."
2111,"News flash! Voting for the candidate you want isn‚Äôt ‚Äúunamerican‚Äù. Fear mongering the base into voting for a candidate whose mentally unfit and has an unflattering political past (to put it lightly) is though. Bernie has all the right to run as an independent if he so chooses to and has no responsibility to the Democratic Party especially after the shit they pulled this election cycle. Joe Biden shares none of Bernies progressive visions and saying that we should all suck it up and vote for Joe is the only disgusting thing here. Good luck to Joe Biden in the general election if he happens to win the primary. Without the backing of a large chunk of the progressive base, a otherwise close race will be called halfway through election night."
2112,Thank god somebody finally shared the same idea i thought of üòÇ. Yoooo joe!!
2113,Abd I believe it was closer to a half billion rather than a billion.
2114,"Maybe the Biden campaign didn't but the Klobuchar and Buttigieg base did and it's undoubtedly what paved the way for Biden last night. Biden's success last night is due mainly to the black community, followed by Pete's base, Beto's base, and Amy's base in that order. 

So yes, a lit of work was done by a lit of people that led to last nights success."
2115,"Biden never said we don‚Äôt need a universal health care system, his platform advocates for one actually. It‚Äôs not Bernie‚Äôs single payer system but it‚Äôs still universal."
2116,"&gt;I didn't say you had bad parents, I speculated that you may have gone astray from their values, because of the manner in which you spoke to me was most unbecoming of a decent, respectable individual.

Don't give into fear mongering and scare tactics, this influx of money/resources is HUGELY great news."
2122,Is your kid under the age of 5?
2123,"I want to tag on one specific example here because I think it's really relevant to you, /u/fuzzy_lymphnodes. Let's talk about college for a sec.

Bernie presents his plan as ""Free College for All."" By the way he describes it, your understanding of the plan is probably this: the Federal government will pay the tuition for every American to attend any public school in the country.

Right? That's what we all think?

It's simply not how his plan works.

The way his plan actually works: if your state, Ohio, decides to make public college free for all Americans, the Federal government will chip in 1/3 of the additional cost for them to do so. Ohio's on the hook for the 2/3s.

I live in Georgia, not Ohio, so I can't say for sure, but I'm *guessing* your state isn't looking to foot 2/3s of the bill for free college. I'm *guessing* your Republican governor would veto that, even if your overwhelmingly Republican General Assembly voted for it in the first place.

See, that's the problem here. Bernie's tricked us all. He made us believe in these promises, but he can't keep them. It makes me really angry."
2124,"Yeah it's odd. Even though the caucuses only counted, the primary got higher turnout"
2125,"I think the biggest factor once the primaries is over is going to be Bernie out there publicly supporting Joe. Some might go rogue, but I think the vast majority of Bernie supporters will listen if Bernie explains to them how existential a Trump re-election is."

2133,"Hey guys, joining from Pete‚Äôs camp. Happy to support Biden!"
2134,"I don't think it'd be a 50-50 split.  However, her time in the Senate probably showed her that while their goals might be more closely aligned, his methods alienate people from working with him.  Biden can and will get more of her agenda done in office than Bernie would.

2139,"&gt;Clinton went through every state and territory contest against Obama and doesn‚Äôt get shit on for it.  

I can think of 2 reasons for that: 
1) 2008 Hillary *suspended her campaign* in June, nearly two months before the 2008 convention. 2) During the 2008 DNC convention, [She called for the suspension of roll call vote and have the all delegate votes go to Obama.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=xngbl3HQs-Y). This is why no one questions Hillary's commitment to the Democratic party and Democratic voters. It's a display of unity that we unfortunately didn't see in the 2016 convention. 

&gt; Also, more Clinton voters 

538 found that [only **74 percent** of Sanders‚Äôs primary voters... voted for Clinton in November 2016.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bernie-sanders-was-helped-by-the-neverhillary-vote-what-does-that-mean-for-his-chances-now/). 

While CNN says that [**84%** of 2008 Hillary Clinton voters during the primaries overwhelming voted for Obama in the general election to 15 percent for McCain](http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/04/exit.polls/)."
2140,"Why are people who dropped out still on the ballot? I know it was already printed before Pete and Amy, but Booker?"
2141,"This links has the whole rally. Biden speaks with 16 minutes left, and says what he says about re-electing Trump 10 minutes left. I‚Äôm not saying this is a big deal, but we should try to keep our discussion based in reality. Unfortunately Biden did mistakenly say that we can only re-elect Trump. The video isn‚Äôt edited. Make up your own mind here. Please don‚Äôt listen to me. If anything the video posted here is edited because it only shows Biden correcting himself, not making the mistake.

2145,"When Bloomberg was still running and blanketing the TV with ads, I've heard so many smug comments pitying the old people for watching TV.

While meanwhile forgetting that the internet is also ripe with propaganda, ads, and misinformation (maybe even more so) ."
2146,We don't exile people anymore but we really should. Comey put Trump in office I'd just like to find a way to banish him forever. Why does he still feel the need to poke his head up ever now and then?
2147,"The women who didn‚Äôt want to come forward about Trump hopes he wouldn‚Äôt become president and felt compelled when he became the presumptive nominee. They didn‚Äôt want to come forward earlier because doing so opens a person to the full rage of internet attacks and threats against their lives and families. It‚Äôs an awful thing to go through. It‚Äôs not opportunistic because there‚Äôs no big payoff for accusers. Most of the attacks against her here are either conspiracy theories or typical slander against victims; she didn‚Äôt come forward right away, her story changed, her supporters have an agenda, he says he didn‚Äôt so it‚Äôs not true, she said something dumb in the past so she can‚Äôt be trusted. All of these tactics are used time and time again to discredit victims of sexual violence. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs definitely true, but I‚Äôm not seeing any real arguments addressing the claims in this entire thread."
2148,"I was literally banned from the sub simply for supporting Biden and criticizing Bernie. I wrote that people should stop giving money to Bernie because it's now throwing good money after bad, and the bitch-ass mod banned me, because it's a propaganda sub that wants to control the public narrative in order to try to influence the election. Reddit rigs elections more than Russia has ever even dreamed of."

I also believe they wud have sung a different tune if bernie qud have in SC.

&gt;

2160,"&gt; Running a good campaign still isn't proof of competence

Yeah just keep telling yourself that lol. 

&gt; like the nasty smears you're repeating against Warren here. You're clearly willing to lie about female candidates to advance your guy. 

1. She did lie about healthcare, and my guy had to call her out on it multiple times for her to correct her platform.

2. She lied CONSTANTLY about his fundraising, and led the campaign against him on his NDA Which she knew would put him and his family in financial ruin and destroy their ability to start a family if he were to break it. She was evil to him this entire primary. So don‚Äôt complain when I point out her history. 

And that‚Äôs on top of her PAC being solely funded by a billionaire who gave thousands to the Arizona Sheriff who committed human rights violations. But Pete was in a wine cave right? 

3. Her DNA scandal is well documented. No reason to deny it.

&gt; God forbid we have a candidate that actually thought about how to get healthcare delivered in a practical way instead of promising voters magical results.

She didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the entire reason her campaign tanked. Pete‚Äôs public option created universal coverage and reduced the deficit, he was the only candidate to accomplish that.

&gt; Still don't get your point about classified info. There are a lot of reasons someone would have access to them and almost none of them involve doing what the president has to do.

At this point I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm even bothering with you. If you can‚Äôt see the importance of running a successful campaign and dealing with national security issues as vital to being president, then it‚Äôs clear I‚Äôm talking to a wall."
2161,"Idk, sure the debates were claimed as Clinton victories but Trump didn't do terrible in those debates. He had more speaking time than her in the first two and was able to drive home his ""nasty woman"" rhetoric. Bottom line, he really didn't let the debates hurt him, so far Biden has been clowning in the debates. I really hope he can clean it up."
2162,"As a Biden suporter, I'll willingly admit that Bernie's ideology has been consistent, and in many ways ahead of its time. It's never been about 'the people in power at the time'-- it's about the fact that the country as a whole didn't support what he was trying to accomplish at the time. Our government is a *representative* democracy.

In recent years, the ideology Bernie's been championing has become a lot more mainstream. I actually agree with most of his goals. But the problem he's faced is that many people (including me) don't see his *policies* as realistic or achievable. He's running on a populist platform of radical, sweeping change-- which just isn't realistic in our government. Donald Trump is a populist, and he hasn't been able to do most of what he promised because that's just not how our government is built.

Things move slowly in our government. This understandably frustrates young, bright-eyed idealists-- but in many ways it's a strength. If Bernie could just swing in and radically change everything in 4 years, the next guy could come in and erase everything-- and much worse. Seeing things like Brexit happen make me immensely glad our government is built like that.

That's why Biden is exactly the candidate we need. He's pragmatic and represents incrementalism. He's running on a platform to the left of Obama, and is going to actually improve peoples' lives because his policies are realistic."
2163,"That might be true. But calling him an asshole isn‚Äôt the best way to begin a conversation with Sanders supporters, either before or after he drops out."

2167,"**Joe Biden (The Onion)**

The Onion's portrayal of Joe Biden is a satirical caricature of Joe Biden, who was the 47th Vice President of the United States between 2009 and 2017. Also known as ""Diamond Joe"" or ""Uncle Joe"", The Onion's Biden is not a straightforward exaggeration or parody of the real Biden, but rather, a distinct character with outrageous qualities who shares little in common with his source. The Onion portrayed Biden as a blue-collar ""goofy uncle"", a muscle car driver, a raucous party animal, a petty criminal, and even a drug-dealing gang member. The character became one of The Onion's most popular creations of the Obama era, garnering critical acclaim and large numbers of page views.

Yang also needs some political seasoning.

A position as Energy chief or some high level post that allows him a place.to grow his brand. More foreign policy and an increase with other minority groups are also a factor."

The most effective method seems to generally be to ignore it, most of these trolls just want the attention. Sure Russia has been using it to divide us, but it is only divisive if we give it authority. We should treat it like the meaningless trash it is.

Do you not think candidates have been using ""Bernie Bros"" to criticize Sanders while avoiding a discussion on substantive differences? I think that is the point Casca is making here. I think you can both condemn the online harassment and question its relevance to a broader political discussion."

I genuinely feel bad for these people. They're in a tough place financially, and instead of using the money for necessities or savings, they're doubling down on a man who they think will save them by becoming President."

I do vote by mail but waited until today to fill out and drop off my ballot."
2270,"It's paywalled, part 2:

&gt;Mr. Rooney said Mr. Biden was ‚Äúmoderate, well-reasoned and genuinely likable ‚Äî none of those things are what Sanders are.‚Äù
&gt;
&gt;And echoing a number of leading officials in both parties, Mr. Rooney said that if Mr. Biden wins the nomination, it would illustrate the degree to which 2016 was a referendum on the Democratic nominee rather than on Mr. Trump.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúThe question is how many people voted for him because they didn‚Äôt want Hillary Clinton,‚Äù he said, arguing that Mr. Biden‚Äôs center-left politics effectively made him ‚ÄúHillary without the other negatives.‚Äù
&gt;
&gt;Mr. Trump‚Äôs advisers argue otherwise ‚Äî and indeed it was their enthusiasm for digging into the record of Mr. Biden‚Äôs son Hunter that led to the president‚Äôs impeachment.
&gt;
&gt;But what alarms many Republicans about the political impact of the virus is that it will so overwhelm the news that it will be difficult to highlight their opposition research about Mr. Biden or draw attention to his gaffes.
&gt;
&gt;One prominent party strategist working on a number of congressional races this year said a series of polls taken in the last two weeks showed the president‚Äôs approval ratings receding to where they were before the 2018 midterms, giving back the gains he made in the aftermath of his impeachment acquittal.
&gt;
&gt;This strategist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about Mr. Trump, said he worried the virus and its effects on the economy would make this campaign entirely about the president, much like the 2018 midterms.
&gt;
&gt;And no modern president may perform better with a foil or worse when measured in his own right than Mr. Trump.
&gt;
&gt;Nonetheless, there have been some constants in terms of how Mr. Trump is perceived by voters.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúThe president‚Äôs job approval has bounced around between 42 percent and 46 percent ever since the spring of 2018, so variation within that range should not be interpreted as anything particularly significant,‚Äù said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. ‚ÄúIf he should break above 46 percent or below 42 percent in the polling averages, then I‚Äôll start to take that seriously. ‚Äú
&gt;
&gt;Representative Chip Roy, a Texas Republican facing a potentially competitive re-election, said it was premature to make sweeping assessments about an election so far off. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lifetime in politics, especially today,‚Äù he said.
&gt;
&gt;But he did offer Mr. Trump a dose of tough-love advice and, in doing so, he suggested that the president‚Äôs prospects might hinge in part on how he handles the current health crisis.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk about politics, just march forward and do your job,‚Äù Mr. Roy said, adding that voters would ask, ‚Äú‚ÄòDid we react properly?‚Äô That‚Äôs how the judgment will fall.‚Äù
&gt;
&gt;Mr. Rooney was even more pointed, urging Mr. Trump to show leadership and take drastic steps to curb the spread of the virus. ‚ÄúHe ought to be doing what other countries are doing,‚Äù he said, such as urging people to stay home, closing schools and demanding public events be rescheduled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a serious health risk here and you‚Äôve got to ask: Where is the United States?‚Äù
&gt;
&gt;But former Representative Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican swept out in the 2018 suburban backlash to Mr. Trump, said that Mr. Biden‚Äôs ascent had greatly complicated Mr. Trump‚Äôs prospects.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúJoe Biden will be very palatable to some of the same moderates who voted against Republicans in the midterms,‚Äù said Mr. Yoder, predicting that Republicans would need embittered Sanders supporters to stay home because ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not going to see a flip back of suburban independents.‚Äù
&gt;
&gt;Mr. DeWine put it more bluntly: ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs Biden, you‚Äôll have disaffected Republicans run to the polls to vote for Biden because they‚Äôre just looking for normal and sane,‚Äù he said."
2271,Warren would be a great choice.
2272,"I'd love to know what the swing counties in question are, that'll be very telling indeed. Hoping they're in swing states as well (NC, WI, MI, PA, AZ, FL, etc.). But I feel very good about the demographics Biden's doing well in (liberal, non-white, moderate, suburban women, and older voters). That's a coalition setup to win."
2273,Sheriff‚Äôs in town. Gonna lock up all malarkey.
2274,"Least surprising. Bernie knows he fades away when he drops out so he'd rather be a sore loser and stay in to get more attention. Biden will continue beating him in every race, honestly Joe should focus on Trump and totally ignore Bernie"
2275,"Yang's math didn't add up, only way it would be even halfway financially possible would be to cut benefits. I believe he gave inconsistent statements on what would be cut."

2277,"I'm under 30, and my impression is that most of my friends, coworkers, dates, etc in my circles also under 30 are a very diverse group politically, ranging from center-left to far left. Even for those who are solidly left, are not necessarily pro Sanders.

For context I'm in California for reference and my circles are mostly PoC. At least at my office it seems among the millennials the support is split between Biden, Warren, and Sanders."

2285,Malarkey!
2286,"Very true, Pete was eloquent to a degree no other candidate could compete with. It was one reason why I liked Pete, and I thought it would be a breath of fresh air if he was in a debate with Trump. As for Biden, we all know that he will never win an award for public speaking. When I began to consider Biden I was worried that his lack of verbal skills was a sign that he had cognitive issues due to his advanced age. But after reading the article linked at the end of this comment, I feel that isn't the case. Biden speaks pretty openly about his stutter and how he sometimes makes verbal gaffes because he is trying to prevent an onset of stuttering. After learning that, I decided it wasn't fair to hold Biden's lack of verbal skills against him. As for his age in general, I would prefer someone younger. I think the Democrats do better with younger candidates. But it seems pretty clear that the race is coming down to two very old candidates, so I'm out of luck on that one. I'm not going to try to make bets on which candidate is in better health, that strikes me as immoral. https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/joe-biden-stutter-profile/602401/"
2287,"You are again intentionally obfuscating this issue, as things stand it is entirely simple. If a candidate is in support of banning the most common arm in the United States then they stand in opposition to the very core of the second amendment, the two ideas are mutually exclusive. 

Calling a ban on AR15's sensible is a dog whistle meant to de-legitimize opposition movements because under that label all opposed are de-facto not using 'common sense'. Banning a rifle platform that is responsible for less than 5% of gun violence, when even that 5% can only be reached when you count all rifles, is not common sense. 

Joe is in open opposition to the very core principles of the second amendment, that is punchy enough for me."

2306,"They were massively helped by a media conspiracy driven by the Clinton campaign and DNC to tell the public that Clinton was already the presumptive nominee before any states had even voted. She also got the questions to one of the debates ahead of time. The fact that the DNC fired DWS and changed their superdelegate system was an admission that the '16 primary was unfair.

Look, Clinton lost. If Biden is going to win this year, you are going to need some people who supported Bernie in '16 to support Biden now. That's me."
2307,"Biden is way to the right of Obama. He was chosen by Obama to appeal to moderates who thought Obama was too progressive (although every one found out 3 years later that Obama was just another corporate neoliberal, and that ‚ÄòHope‚Äô was just a slogan).

If you wanna continue the FDR and JFK‚Äôs legacy, vote for the only progressive in the race."
2308,"Keep things neat and polite in all VP discussions.

2309,"That's a good question. Biden was instrumental is getting Obama to support gay marriage. Biden was one of the first to come out in support of gay marriage. Biden got millions of people health care when he helped get the ACA passed. My health insurance now covers things it did not before, like mental health, and I can't be refused insurance because of pre-existing conditions.

Meanwhile, Bernie has opened 3 post offices in his 30 years in congress because he can't work well with others and does not believe in compromise."
2310,"I was going to start quoting from the section on Joe's website that addresses immigration, but there's just so much it's hard to simply bullet point.  
  
So I suggest you read: https://joebiden.com/immigration/  
    
As well as: https://joebiden.com/centralamerica/  
  
His website is actually an amazing source on his stances with **very** comprehensive explanations on how he plans on addressing the issues at hand."
2311,"The problem with that theory is that Bernie has been expected to do very poorly in the races tomorrow for a while. It isn't until April 28th when Delaware, New York, and other northeastern states where he's supposed to do relatively well will vote.

In practical terms, I expect it to be about a tie in those states, whereas Biden's wins tomorrow and elsewhere will be absolute blowouts. Therefore, it won't have an effect on the outcome, and predictions that Biden is 99%+ expected to win are correct. However, it does give Bernie an excuse to stay in. We don't know exactly how much of his campaign money he's funneling to Jane, but campaigning is lucrative for them, and by now we know that expecting socialists to actually bend to the greater good is like expecting Lucy to actually let Charlie Brown kick the football."

2320,"Biden's spent his whole life building relationships and coalitions with politicians across the country, and has broad appeal to both Democrats and disaffected Republicans. He also has high positive name recognition (he was one of the most popular VPs in recent memory), which was emphasized by him winning states on Super Tuesday that he didn't even campaign in, during a time when he was struggling for funding. Furthermore, his legislative history, while it has some black spots (like the 1994 Crime Bill people often bring up...which Bernie also voted for btw), it shows someone who's actually productive and motivated.

Compare that with Bernie Sanders. Sanders didn't vote until he was in his 30s (so he could vote for himself, mind you), has spent the past five years catering to his base instead of building up support (under the false assumption that young people would turn out in droves, despite ample historical evidence that that never works), and his 29 years in Congress are marked by only *three* bills that were introduced and passed. Two of which involved renaming post offices in Vermont. Additionally, Bernie's supposed ""consistency"" on a lot of issues speaks to a broader issue of him never being seriously challenged, what with his relatively safe seats in Congress over the years (it's easy to come out in support of LGBTQ+ rights when you don't have to worry about your constituents turning against you). Sanders even considered running against Obama in the 2012 primaries, which shows how much he actually cares about the Democratic party."
2321,"Not being endorsed by Beto and compliment his gun policy would be a good start. He called for explicit confiscation of legally owned firearms. That's the endgame boogieman for 2A advicates.

Folks who like their guns and like the 2A have no reason to vote for Biden on those grounds. 

""Holding gun manufactures accountable"" for activity committed by people is dumb and will do little but price the poor out of gun ownership. 

Limiting firearm purchases to one per month, buybacks, banning online sales of firearms are not desirable to law abiding citizens. 

Red flag laws also blatantly disregard due process.

I like Biden a lot more than I like my guns but my honest answer for anyone who values legal ownership of fire arms above everything would be to vote for someone else. 

He makes no concessions to legal owners. Statewide reciprocity of CCW should be fine. Everyone under his purview would have background checks. Hell, they'd even all have smart guns apparently. Why should legal gun owners be further inconvenienced? We're only for common sense regulations right?"
2322,Looking at this I'm not sure why Bernie fans seem to imply only Bernie can defeat Trump. Seems like Joe is sweeping and getting a ton of people to the polls

2325,"The response is heavily dependent on who is making that criticism. I'm a huge nuclear energy advocate (one of the big issues I disagree heavily with Bernie on), and thus don't support the GND. However, I am an advocate for massive action against climate change as a priority. Most people within my personal life who I've discussed politics with (including progressives) have come around to nuclear energy, so the sentiment of Biden being in favor of it does help. 

However, there are those who don't share my view on nuclear energy. Especially since the GND polls very well, this becomes a different frame of argumentation to go on. The comparison game to Trump does come in handy for this one; rejoining the Paris Climate Accords isn't doing enough. However, having an administration who believes in the threat of climate change enables for a substantially different position for climate activists to start from compared to this current one. Thus, if people care about having any chance based on the two trajectories, a Biden presidency is the best shot. I do try to discuss nuclear energy with them though.  If they can agree on that, the conversation becomes easier."
2326,"yeah we dgaf about where Obama falls on your opinion of extreme right standards or whatever tf ""centralist half"" means. we just want to prioritize healthcare, education, environment and a scaled back military industrial complex. sorry if your Bernie friends were mean to you."
2327,I think I voted in 2016 for Clinton I don't think there was that push online to go do it.
2328,"This doesn't sync well with what I've seen...

People actually seem really happy with Joe, and very relieved that the party has united behind a single candidate. He's just such an honest, positive, and likeable guy, a welcome antidote to the wall-to-wall corruption, negativity, and greed we've been getting for the past three years.

Joe's really been energized by the positive reception he's gotten, and it's clear he's a force to be reckoned with now.

The exception, of course, is the remaining hardest core Bernie supporters and the Russian/GOP troll armies that egg them on.  But they were never going to be an easy case, and in the end aren't significant."
2329,"Good list. But I don‚Äôt know about the second one. God willing, when Sanders drops out he will endorse Biden and we can probably expect his supporters to vote as they did in 2016.

The Biden campaign could try reaching out to the Sanders supporters who won‚Äôt vote, or were going to vote third party, but I doubt Biden could change more then a handful of minds. And by moving to the left, he would alienate many more moderate voters. 

IMO Biden‚Äôs best strategy is present himself as a viable and moderate alternative to working class and suburban voters. If that means Biden has to buck the demands of some leftists, well so be it. They had abysmal turnout rates anyway. It may even help Biden down then line to clearly separate himself from Sanders as it will frustrate GOP attempts to paint Biden as a socialist.

TLDR. Moving to extremes to boost turnout has failed for Sanders, and Biden should not seek to replicate that failure by moving left after he‚Äôs all but won the primary."

We as Democrats owe Senator Sanders so much for, if nothing else, simply moving the national discourse leftward perhaps more than any other human being in the last 50 tears. Joe Biden's healthcare plan would not be considered moderate if not for Bernie. His carbon plan would not be considered moderate if not for Bernie. His education plan would not be moderate if not for Bernie.

Eight years ago, these ideas weren't even in the table, and even Democrats were hesitant to vote for them out of how radical they seemed.

2351,no way. what
2352,"No, because those are all manufactured concerns. Biden has been gaffe prone for decades. He is not declining. Healthwise, he doesn't look anything as old as Bernie or Donald. The debates may not even happen. Trump is trying to get out of them. He debated Palin and Ryan just fine in the VP debates, and the presidential debates don't really have that much of an effect.  


He didn't do anything for Ukraine. Hillary Clinton had emails on a server that she shouldn't have had (just like most of the intelligence community did). Biden had nothing to do with Ukraine. It was just a conspiracy hypothesis that Trump has disseminated.  


Also, these ""problems"" are only a fraction of those that Bernie has. High propensity moderate voters are much, much, much, much more important that low propensity young liberal (non)voters and a much larger portion of the electorate. Disenfranchising the former guarantees a loss of Congress. Being rigid and uncompromising is also highly problematic. Bernie gets nothing done as a Senator. He will get even less done as a president.

see maltas reaction to pete or the town of Obama reaction to obama.or keyans reaction to obama.or indonesia reaction to obama.

second the VP could be a cruical tool for outreach to the Chinese people perhaps not openly but stressing how america let no Chose a Chinese person to  rise to the top   would make Chinese people feel positively towards the US .

the Chinese communist party would then find it harder to rile up anger towards  the US on matters of dispute as the Chinese american VP could be brought  in to respond and say ""we love china the goverment is just fucking up""

To which Biden responded saying that's not true, and later clarifying ""everything was on the table"" but that, ""I did not support those cuts.""

I think a lot of people would've accepted that he had different views back than he does now, but to blatantly say he didn't support it seems a little egregious. For the record, here are verifiable statements Biden has made on social security:

&gt;‚ÄúWhen I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well,‚Äù he told the Senate in 1995. ‚ÄúI meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans‚Äô benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once, I tried it twice, I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.‚Äù 

And

&gt;Q: ""Do you think it's fair though for voters to question your commitment to Social Security when in the past you've proposed a freeze to it?""

&gt;Biden: ""No, I didn't propose a freeze.""

&gt;""You did.""

How do you view such statements if there's video evidence? Perhaps I'm being misled on the interpretation of freezing federal spending, but he's also lied about advocating for freezing it as well. I'm happy to listen to and accept opposing arguments however."

Nah. The media has been engaged in a desperate smear campaign against Bernie Sanders and his campaign ever since the elections started, the criticism is incessant and continues today. I can't count how many times I've seen the talking heads crucify him. 


Guys like Joe Biden have decieved voters into believing that attempting medicare-for-all isn't worth while. Of course it is. The reverberating effect of having a president who sought this out would be impossible to ignore. His policies are not too far left, nearly every modern, civilized nation on the planet has adopted these policies. 


Joe Biden doesn't want to improve our health care at all, he just wants to stick a band-aid on it. Can't really fix an amputated arm with a band-aid. Joe Biden aslo does not advocate for the federal legalization of marijuana. How any of you can vote for a president that still does not support this is baffling. Federally illegal marijuana is a policy deeply rooted in racist politics and authoritarianism. Plenty of established research is publically available on the short and long-term effects, Biden has no excuse for this stance other than pandering to the right-wing vote. 


Mark my words; Biden will lose 2020. We are staring down the loaded double-barrel of what will inevitably be another 4 years of Trump. To be perfectly honest, if this is currently the best the DNC can provide as representation, then I will be leaving the party and they will lose a vote permanently. This entire campaign has been a repeat of 2016 and I'm done with the corruption. This system cannot work for us."

2441,"This has already been posted in this thread, but here you go:

&gt;**Decriminalize the use of cannabis and automatically expunge all prior cannabis use convictions**. Biden believes no one should be in jail because of cannabis use. As president, he will decriminalize cannabis use and automatically expunge prior convictions. And, he will support the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes, leave decisions regarding legalization for recreational use up to the states, and reschedule cannabis as a schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts.

2478,Negotiating with democrats. Being a president who isn‚Äôt all bluster like trump or sanders.
2479,But Biden did not go on the attack and pay the race card on the front runner when he went out.  It has been hugely insulting to me to see Harris play the race card when she has a fraction of the experience of Joe and play the race card for something she agrees with him on.  Harris' primary performance horrified me in a way that few do.

So, when thinking about candidates, I believe that's what we should evaluate. I don't believe he would pick a woman or POC simply for political reasons.

2492,"One of my friends said this eloquently: money will get your campaign most of the way there...but not all the way there. 

Bloomberg had a strong ground game and endless resources, but despite his political competence he was a very flawed candidate. Once Biden turned it around in South Carolina, many people went back to what they knew and trusted, and that is Joe."

2496,Thanks for the link. That's good news.
2497,"Joe Biden and candidates like him are  centralist. Like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, they will continue to ignore problems that truly plague the working class. Take for instance the student loan crisis - which Biden helped orchestrate--Obama and Clinton had a total of 16 years to do something about this crisis. Many of us will be paying for our student loans until we die because the money we spend goes toward interest. My interest rate is 6%. Every single dollar I've paid on my student loans has gone towards interest. My credit score is 720, but I can't refinance because my debt to income ratio is too high. Even doing something as simple as canceling the interest and ensuring that my money goes toward the loan is valuable. Obama and Clinton had 16 years to recognize that there was a problem and do something about it. In order to do that, they will need to ACTUALLY CARE. Joe Biden has helped create laws to protect the banks and ensure that student loans cannot be included in bankruptcy.

Joe Biden is nefarious. Plain and simple. He has always promoted racist policies. He was the first white ""liberal"" to oppose the integration of schools by upholding segregation of busing. Why do you think that one most racist senators of all time Strom Thurmond was good friends with Joe? The company you keep speaks volumes about you and he was hand selected by Thurmond himself to speak at his funeral. Has CNN or MSNBC even mentioned this? Many black people of my generation who were born after the Civil Rights Movement are still being handcuffed by Jim Crow. People cry that slavery so detrimental to our people, but ignore the fact that had it not been for Jim Crow and institutional racism, we would have risen decades ago.

Our parents and grandparents did not have access to a college education--equal education for that matter - which in turn left opportunities for jobs that paid above $15 an hour minimal. My grandmother raised 7 kids by herself working 3 low wage jobs. She couldn't afford to send my mother to college. My mother is also a single mother and she in turn worked low wage jobs. Which continued the cycle of poverty. I broke the cycle of poverty, but I traded one chain for another.

Not only did Biden's polices of supporting segregation are morally wrong, it systematic blocks people like me from opportunities for equal education. While Biden was working to support segregation, Bernie was working to fight housing discrimination in Chicago. Black people were often denied opportunities to rent houses in various areas of Chicago. His fight against this injustice spread to other areas in the country. Which allowed families like mine to move into the suburbs.This alone provided me with a better opportunity to obtain a better education than what was given to my mother and her siblings.

They attended school in Cleveland's inner city. Despite the fact this was after Brown vs. The Board of Education, the teachers were allowed to separate the black children from the white children and call the black children names like apes and the n word. Who expects anyone to learn in such environment? Needless to say, their education was subpar which in turn leads to low paying jobs. This ultimately leads to a cycle of poverty. We cannot afford to ignore the fact that the system is broken and needs to change. 

Voting Blue regardless is a foolish mantra because it ultimately does matter who. Trump is not the only opposition we have. It's the people who pretend to care about our issues to gain our support and continue to do nothing."
2498,"Pete's support (and Amy's, and Beto's) was a big fucking deal. But I think Clyburn's impact resuscitated Biden's campaign. Not just winning SC, but because of JC that margin of victory and voter turnout ripped Bernie's ""only I can generate voter enthusiasm"" argument to shreds. If Biden didn't win SC so emphatically, those folks likely wouldn't have suspended their campaigns. 

POC saved Biden's bacon.

2513,"That is exactly what I am saying, when he had a chance he tried to get rid of them since that is his stance. Later on he had no other chance to get the nomination other than appeal to the delegates, who are responsible for the nomination. That is in no way flip flopping, he never abandoned his stance"
2514,"We need to flood the zone with positive ads for Joe and chainsaw-level attack ads against Trump in the fifteen states that actually matter.

It is dismaying to hear, time and time again, the Democratic front runner say ""Do not vote for me"" when pressed on problematic stances he has held before. Does he not tell her to vote for Trump or is there some context I'm missing?"
2521,"&gt;Aside from his voting record being the opposite of democratic principles, I am horrified by the videos of him putting his hands on young girls.

His voting record is basically a record of the mainstream positions of the Democratic party over the last 40+ years, some of which obviously look like mistakes in hindsight. Of course, the lists you see of Biden's voting record from the Bernie camp only show the things that might look bad in 20/20 hindsight, not any of the positive accomplishments. It's propaganda, not a balanced view of his record in the context of the times. I'm not denying that he's made mistakes, but to call it ""the opposite of democratic principles"" is just wrong.

&gt;I am horrified by the videos of him putting his hands on young girls.

Some people are just touchy. As someone who likes personal space, that kind of thing makes me uncomfortable too. But it has been common as an innocent behavior, especially in Biden's generation and older. Since the MeToo movement I think he's become more aware of how some people are likely to perceive it differently than he intends it, especially because so many guys (not Biden) have used some faux-innocent version of similar behavior as a prelude to actual harassment. Understanding this, he's made a mostly-successful effort to break that habit.  

What is important is that Biden has had a long life in the very public eye as a Senator and Vice President and never had anything approaching a MeToo allegation of sexually-motivated misconduct against him. It's all just been innocent platonic affection that looks bad in light of shifting societal values, by a man who didn't realize those values were shifting until people educated him. If there were some more nefarious version behind it, we'd have heard about it by now.

&gt;I'm undecided if I will vote for biden in the main election if he becomes the candidate. 

It's hard to imagine anyone who sincerely believes in liberal values could write that. Do you have any idea who Donald Trump is and what he's done?"
2522,Can you elaborate now so I can repeat you when I encounter people who claim Sanders would be a centrist in euros?
2523,"The source of the study says this in their summary: 

&gt; Of the 194 million U.S. adults ages 19 to 64 in 2018, an estimated 87 million, or 45 percent, were inadequately insured (see [Tables 1 and 2](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/2019-02/Collins_hlt_ins_coverage_8_years_after_ACA_2018_biennial_survey_tables.pdf#page=1)). 

But fine, even if I grant you that the number is exaggerated.  That still means there are ***tens of millions*** of people in the US who are one accident or disease away from losing their home, or their life.  One candidate was fighting to make sure they all had health insurance.  Another candidate admits that in the best case scenario for his policy, 6 to 9 million people will still be uninsured

&gt; He‚Äôll also build on the Affordable Care Act with a plan to insure more than an estimated 97% of Americans.

2589,"The question was about how to deal with this national crisis.

Bernie, rather than focus on the crisis, was trying to pivot the question to specifics of M4A, even though it's tangential when other approaches (like making all testing and treatment in this crisis free) work just as well."
2590,I literally just cried reading this. Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
2591,"You must not have paid attention to the 2018 elections. Bob Casey in a midterm election got the same amount of votes in the Philadelphia-area. as Hillary Clinton. Bob Casey meanwhile is as anti-Philadelphia as you can get, being from Lehigh County and being Pro-Lifeish. There is a lot of Trump hate in the SE part of the state."
2592,"Whats something Joe would want to work with Republicans on that they are interested in working on?  


Whenever centrist democrats work with GOP they get Trumps, or Bush's tax cuts and endless increases in military spending."
2593,"Pete, Amy and Steyer dropping out before Super Tuesday and endorsing Biden have him a huge boost. Biden also said he was the most electable candidate, which his good results and turnouts proved.
After super Tuesday Bloomberg also dropped out and endorsed Biden. So basically almost all of the supporters from the other candidates went to Biden."
2594,"A message Bernie and his supporters need to hear but refuse to acknowledge because ""rigged"":

***""The direction of a democracy is determined by the voters who show up.""***"
2595,What about the numerous women he groped and smelled right out in the open? Serial abusers often parade their behaviour. Like trump talking about being attracted to his daughter. Seems like we need to consider that Biden may have done this.
2596,How do I retweet this reddit comment?
2597,"Lol. Sorry, memes don‚Äôt work on us over here."
2598,"Joe is an endless wellspring of empathy. When he connects with someone, he truly means it."
2599,I'm hoping for Tammy Duckworth. She isn't shy about calling out Trump on his bullshit.
2600,"Yeah this is what got me about the exchange... It's the most obvious question, there's no way in hell you wouldn't expect that question."
2601,Still not wrong to show A) why Biden is more suitable for presidency B) his policies.
2602,"check out r/neoliberal for much much more greatness. be prepared to read, learn and see the greatest memes of all time."
2603,"Yes. The whole ""you care about mean people online while children are dying for lack of healthcare"" thing really angers me. I mean, can't I care about both? The best policy means nothing if Trump wins."
2604,"Whoops I didn‚Äôt see that that‚Äôs awesome thanks for pointing it out! And of course. Pete was my #1 by a good margin but for 2nd at this point it wasn‚Äôt even a competition. I‚Äôve always liked Joe and well now I get to back him, so there‚Äôs always a bright side. So I‚Äôm grabbing my aviators and riding with Biden!"
2605,I‚Äôm shocked. I thought for sure she‚Äôd rail at the media and the DNC.
2606,One of the Senate Tammys. Either Duckworth or Baldwin.
2607,"If Joe Biden wins, his legacy will be paving the way for the first female president in the history of our country. Pretty good legacy tbh."
2608,"They don‚Äôt even have a post about it lol. Speaking of, they don‚Äôt have a single post about this week‚Äôs wins in the 3 states. They just ignore the losses like they don‚Äôt matter."
2609,*Fact*.
2610,"Very true. I like Bernie and will be voting for him, but on certain subreddits and Twitter apparently I'm not die-hard enough for those Bernie fans. It's really, really odd to be lectured and told off by people who are on the same side,  and makes me think something fishy is going on. I seem to encounter this on social media.

As far as IRL goes, my husband gets a little too heated when talking about politics, so I have to remind him to chill out. He's never been an asshole about it, but when he starts talking about things he's passionate about, his voice gets really loud. I also told him to stop bringing up Sanders with EVERYONE we hang out with. Like can we please have a double date night where the husband's aren't debating about Capitalism vs Socialism. 

Other people are entitled to their own opinions and beliefs and can vote for whoever they want. People seem to forget that things aren't black and white. There's asshole Bernie supporters and nice Bernie supporters. I've been trash talked by a Buttigieg fan and called names by Warren fans. But then I also have really great friends who love Buttigieg and very liberal friends that I love dearly who went for Warren, and you know what? That's okay! I'm so happy to see people engaged in politics and critically thinking about who deserves their vote. 

And on the flip side, my most favorite student told me recently that his parents are Trump supporters. He told me their reasoning, and while I whole heatedly disagree with their beliefs, they still managed to raise a bright, talented, funny, and compassionate kid. 

With all that said, I'm sorry some Bernie supporters are jerks. It really bums me out because it doesn't feel good to be like lumped in with douchebags and it doesn't represent Bernie's message of taking care of those in need.

Anyway, good luck to Joe. And my condolences to Warren supporters, I hope we haven't heard the last of her as she is an incredible, intelligent, hard working woman."
2611,What is telling is how Fox is staying away from this.
2612,DEBATE ME
2613,"Good, they shouldn't move the elections. Just makes a mess of things and gives Trump the precedent to try to move the election."
2614,Watching him assemble the moderate megazord has really been a remarkable experience. A truly unprecedented shift.
2615,"I was just about to say, that's the lady that looks like Conan"
2616,"You like seeing people die from preventable disease in the richest country in history? We should just keep going like we are right? 

Unreal."
2617,It's Chucks.   Warren waffling is going to hurt her. She seems to have a hard time getting her priorities straight.
2618,This is why they're ramping up the propaganda against Biden. They are terrified
2619,"Fellow YangGang member here, but I cannot in good conscience support a warmonger:  
[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/17/joe-biden-role-iraq-war](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/17/joe-biden-role-iraq-war)"
2620,"First things first. Thank you for your honest and genuine comment. The more we learn to communicate effectively the stronger our nation is as a whole. Moving on.

I understand your sentiment but I have the following counter-argument:

The longer Bernie stays in the race the less time there will be between Biden being the nominee and the general election. This matters because some people will need time to come to terms with the fact that their preferred candidate isn't going to win. Without that adjustment period people are more likely to give in to their knee-jerk reflexes and simply not vote out of spite. This is why it's important for Bernie to drop out once it is obvious that he can't win, because it gives people time to realize that even if the policies that Biden is supporting aren't exactly what they want that they are close enough for them to vote for them.

Second point, Bernie and his supporters are using campaign tactics that are actively trying to create an image that Biden is crazy/dementia/mentally incapable of being president. This is exceptionally dangerous for the long term viability of the Democratic campaign and is honestly irresponsible and morally reprehensible. If the Bernie supporters want to campaign on the issues then they should spend less time name-calling and mud slinging."
2621,"‚ÄúExtensive‚Äù testing does nothing about regulating the process: https://www.loc.gov/law/help/restrictions-on-gmos/usa.php

Without guidelines on the process, it is easy to change the composition of food without labeling it as including the new additives."
2622,Why would Sen. Sanders even want to run against Joe at this point. The amount of endorsements is becoming a record breaker.
2623,is she a Dem?  or a agent?
2624,Bernie is a trump agent.
2625,"It's the smart thing to do for her on political ambitions, the party, the country and the world.  Let's hope she has that foresight."
2626,We can only hope.
2627,^this is how you get people to come to you. Not calling those other candidates rats and various other homophobic or sexist things or along your followers to freely do so also helps
2628,"Welcome! We don‚Äôt have to agree on everything and many of us aren‚Äôt huge fans of Joe‚Äôs history. Still we have a common goal, and that‚Äôs what matters. Glad to have you with us"
2629,I'm going to level with ya: I'm not going to watch. I'm so sick of this primary. It's time to focus on the general.
2630,"He took a presser and outlined how he would prepare America to stave off future pandemics like this. Beyond that, there‚Äôs not a lot he *can* do while out of office."

2636,"It's a +9 average by combining all those states together, not +9 in each state. Same thing goes to every category (diverse states, blue wall, midwest)."
2637,Nevada picking up midwestern voters? Not be sarcastic just genuinely questioning it. Idk. I would like Whitmer for VP as much as Klobuchar. But I just think klobuchar is popular in the Midwest and now has name recognition.
2638,"China is communist, or did you forget that?"
2639,They've been dirty. Trump has made them filthy.
2640,He doesn't want to lose his favorite past time: bashing Democrats.
2641,YES!
2642,Lol a bunch of rich white guys telling the poor and minorities how privileged they are.
2643,Too late.
2644,They are counting on us to tear each other apart.  But I don't think that has to happen.
2645,Why?
2646,DNC has actively been rigging and altering vote results and you are out here saying that Bernie continuing to run is cynical? That is such a bizarre argument
2647,This is potentially a good meme to win over some bernie people tho
2648,"It's called dealing with shitheads.

It's exactly what we want.

Trump is a shithead and the current republican Congress and Senate are being shitheads.

It's time to clean up the shit.

I've got 0 understanding as to why the progressives believe this to be a successful line of attack; I'm sorry, not progressives, Bernie, Trump and Republican supporters rather. 
 
It's crystal clear who is needed."
2649,Look at the deficit is grew by far the largest in the last 3ish decades during obama and has significantly stopped growing under the presidents this statistic shows a bad picture while there has been some growth in reality
2650,"You do realize test kit production isn‚Äôt dependent on the healthcare format of a country right?

The reasons we don‚Äôt have sufficient tests is because the Trump Administration declines to use the WHO tests and failed to use the National Defense Authorization Act early enough."

2659,Only one I think is likely to go to Bernie is Washington. Hoping the margins in the other 5 are massively in Joe‚Äôs favor though.
2660,"I think he should choose a woman. Definitely one to the left of him. Personally I think Tammy Baldwin would be perfect. Woman, progressive but pragmatic, openly gay, experienced Senator from Wisconsin"
2661,Is there a way to track the growth of a subreddit? Like a graph or something?
2662,"I appreciate the increasing interest in policy among voters these days, but the fact of the matter is that most Democrats are very similar to each other, policy-wise. Biden and Bernie probably agree with each other 95% of the time, and while the remaining 5% can and should be hashed out in a primary, it's not the unfathomable gulf that people have made it out to be."
2663,We welcome everyone!
2664,"According to Joe Biden. All men and women are created by ‚ÄúGoyoonothething‚Äù

2667,This sub really is turning into our second home! It's good to see so many of you over here! üíú
2668,"Sorry should have clarified! If Warren is chosen as VP in say late May, she can vacate her seat. 160 days later, the special election can take place in November. As soon as Biden is sworn in, there already has been a Dem in Warren's old seat for almost 3 months."
2669,Political Twitter is terrible. It has been for a while and I'm afraid it's getting continually worse.
2670,"I think he actually does, but unlike Trump, he actually knows how to use a prompter so you can't tell he is using one."

2674,"It's still up, too."
2675,"Plus, it would be perfectly timed now, since Warren just dropped out and a lot of people are talking about when will we finally have a woman president. It could help attract that segment of Warren's supporters."
2676,He was forced to pick a religious right true believer. Some people think he deliberately picked an idiot in the hopes that he could replace her with a national security focused choice later.
2677,"20 year old Biden voter in Greene County here! So glad to see others voting on a paper ballot. I got many shocked stares when I requested one at my polling location and was even asked by the volunteer if I was ‚Äúsure I wanted a paper ballot‚Äù because it‚Äôs ‚Äúextra check in work.‚Äù I told her that after what happened in Iowa, I wanted to make sure my vote was tallied properly and more secure. A few other volunteers laughed but I insisted. Thanks for voting and showing that young voters matter, too! 

#MOforJOE"
2678,"Never forget! And don't worry about being dated. I commented a few mins ago ""we're heeeeeerrrrrre"", and I'm gonna feel super old if no one gets the reference."
2679,Before Bernie does... LOL
2680,"uhhhh...hahaha! 

Well okay IDK how you think a socialist is gonna beat Trump hahaha"
2681,"1. He can pass legislation and change policy nationally.  He passed the Violence Against Women Act.  He was a main driver of Obamacare.  He nailed the Obama administration down on allowing full gay marriage.  For all Sander's bluster, the only legislation he has proposed and passed as a senator was naming a post office.  The issue is that other politicians [don't like him](https://news.yahoo.com/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-nobody-likes-him-144423210.html).  He thinks ""revolution"" will pass legislation, but that's just nonsense.  He's lived a career of empty promises.

2. Biden is a positive unity candidate.  He hasn't smeared.  He hasn't attacked.  He isn't attacking Sanders for his heart attack, getting on the wrong private jet, owning three homes, etc.  Yet he endures attacks on him calling him senile for having a stutter,   edited videos of Biden supposedly praising Trump (Twitter actually flagged them as edited and fraudulent), and claims he wants to slash social security (rated false by Politifact).

3. He can win the national election.  Polls show he would win Florida, North Carolina, and Michigan.  Biden is wining the Black vote, White vote, Independent vote, Democratic vote, and anti-Trump Republican vote.  The only demographics Bernie wins are voters in the Whitest counties, and White youth under 29 (including Hispanic White).  This won't win the general.  Furthermore, Biden is projected to keep the House and may tie the Senate.  Bernie is projected to lose 40+ House seats.  The reality is that Bernie turns off more moderate voters than he picks up at the extreme left fringes."
2682,Thank you!
2683,[In an office room for TYT](https://i.imgur.com/wayS3Vy.jpg)
2684,I really do remember that. Makes me think of the partisan blinders I must have been wearing.
2685,Yes please!
2686,One thing I find funny is that a lot of supporters of other candidates come here expecting a lot of OG ride or die Biden supporters and then try to pick fights. It‚Äôs funny because almost all of us liked other candidates better at one point and basically no one here is Biden or bust (if that is even a thing). We will keep welcoming them here but it‚Äôs that much easier because most of us got on the Biden train less than a month ago and still like a lot of the other people in the Democratic Party and think they would be great in the administration.
2687,"My husband and I are both working from home as of tomorrow.  I adjudicate unemployment claims, so I have decent job security."
2688,I‚Äôm okay with memes but I don‚Äôt love this gonzo style stuff. Let‚Äôs keep it classy!
2689,Anyone but Harris.
2690,"Great Work.

  
The thing is we need to pull together.  Over the next few months things start to get worse‚Äìyou are forgetting people‚Äôs names even though you have worked with them for many years, you are making stupid mistakes at work, you are forgetting to go to meetings, you are finding it really difficult to do the simplest of tasks, you continually forget where you parked the car. Again, you are told by friends and colleagues and doctors that it is down to stress; that you need to slow down, maybe take time off, etc. But you know there is something wrong and you know that it is more than stress. So lets focus on Getting President Joe there."
2691,I don't very much like the fact that you are saying that Trump only has 18 charges so jo's don't matter. I think we have to take these charges seriously. The base of the democratic party is black women and women in general. It feels bad to just ignore claims without first looking into them.
2692,"Meh, I love her too much for her jabs at Bloomberg.

She's also a better version of Bernie.
She's about as much to the left as him, but has managed to get more done in 10 years then Bernie in 30. And she doesn't seem to have a BernieBro problem."
2693,Oh how I love this.
2694,This is very ironic.
2695,"it's okay, you can say secret service, we're all thinking it"
2696,"Jokes aside, how much more proof do we need that that sub was basically used as a propaganda tool by bad faith actors? Now that Joe has an insurmountable lead, the flood gates were almost quite literally closed in terms of pro Sanders and anti anyone else posts."
2697,is there a vp that could help getting those states?
2698,"This is bad but it sounds worse than it is. ""would not commit to voting for"" ‚â† ""refuses to vote for"". Their candidate's campaign is losing and that hurts a lot. People who time need to legitimately grieve before making objective decisions, even if that objective decision is...you know, not supporting Trump."
2699,"God, I wish he was in charge right now.  This would be so much less scary."
2700,"They're protesting everyone, Bernie got one as well a few weeks ago"
2701,"A debate at this point doesn‚Äôt help Joe in any way.


At worst, it inflames Bernie‚Äôs hard-core supporters and solidifies their negative perception of Joe so they don‚Äôt vote for him.  Even worse, Joe makes a flub on stage with extemporaneous speaking and it ends up in a Republican attack ad.


Joe has plenty of time for debates.  He can start working on his general election debate prep when he‚Äôs not worrying about Sanders."
2702,"nah he's the nominee already you see, Trump is the big bad wolf! /s"
2703,"Adding Mike Bloomberg was a very stupid idea. Republicans will vote for Trump anyway, but the progressives may sit this election out if moderates focus on Bloomberg's endorsment."
2704,"This is about as surprisint as ""Sanders wins Vermont"", except for Biden it's like a dozen or more states with several times as many delegates each."
2705,^ Correct. I am genuinely voting for Joe. Longtime huge fan of him.
2706,"Nothing and nobody is perfdct. Joe applied to the current issues, Bernie didn't.

Bernie has/had to get off his stump speech and put some new ideas out. Moderate toned stuff and a proper focused stuff. Also Bernie is still extremely soft on foreign policy."
2707,I'm afraid unless severe changes in diet and physical exercise are made there will be issues with president rising.
2708,It‚Äôs not communism to want the best for every single person in America.. we want people to be able to go to college without tens of thousands of dollars in debt and have health care..  I‚Äôm here to try to learn from Biden supporters..
2709,Are any states still counting?
2710,You‚Äôve accomplished so much
2711,"&gt;Biden tops Trump

I see they‚Äôre both going for the LGBT vote"
2712,Shame on us. Never again. And we have to be just as diligent in this primary. Take nothing for granted.
2713,"Yeah, same. I like Bernie on this, but might have to live with Biden. The ""Weed's a gateway drug"" just adds more to the criticism he's a dinosaur. I went through the the ""Joe's plan for ..."" section of his website and can't find shit."
2714,"I wish we could get more people who believe in absolute anti-interventionism to hear these sorts of stories. Yes, diplomacy should always be the priority, and war should be a last resort, but in cases like Bosnia and Kosovo, if there's a genocide happening and we are in position to stop it, we absolutely should."
2715,"Hooray, another AZ voter! Be sure to drop off your ballot instead of mailing it."
2716,"I like your response, it was enjoyable to read and I fully understand your point of view and agree with some of those points. I loved Pete, and a few other candidates as well, including Bernie. But Joe, I don‚Äôt like what he represents; it will feel just like it felt voting for Hillary, empty. I will not do that to myself again, I‚Äôm sitting this one out. Please don‚Äôt get discouraged, I am positive that some might read a message like this and rethink their position. It is that good! Thank you for taking the time to do so."
2717,BS knows that.  He just wants to keep attacking Biden.
2718,OMG I didn't know this flair existed thank u
2719,Bernie should drop out
2720,"Is no one going to point out the irony of how a speech talking about the dangers of constant attacks on one another... was manipulated into an attack piece. They literally do not listen, do they?"
2721,I hope this is more than a slogan.
2722,There will be no place for hatred against ice cream in this administration.
2723,This is not going to be a successful strategy for the Sanders campaign.
2724,"I will delete if this isn't verified in short order. But, if true, this surprises me 0%. Class gent, class campaign, class act."
2725,"Or you can just get them to follow the two evils idea to it‚Äôs logical conclusion: 

If Biden is only marginally different than Trump, and if he is running on a platform more progressive than Obama‚Äôs, then logic would dictate that Obama was Trump. 

Any sane person will instantly recognize how this forms a problem, but I guess there is the likelihood that the Berner thinks Obama is evil."
2726,"My god, i'm nervous as hell right now"
2727,"I'm hoping the Pete subreddit stickies something after the endorsement tonight. That place was magic for a political subreddit and reaffirmed my faith in humanity. Either way, I'm 100% in."
2728,"Did you not know any black people in positions of authority growing up? A teacher, a pastor, a boss? 

White people lose their damn minds every single day they have to defer to a black person in authority. It takes conscious effort for white people to unlearn and fight back against the racism at all levels of society."
2729,"I totally get that. But I also feel like we should probably play a safer bet or someone from the rust belt just to make 100% sure we hang onto those states. If this was 2024, I'd definately agree, but with soo much on the line it's probably better not to make a point about expanding the definition of ""normal"" and picking someone a little bit more safe. I'm glad it's going to be a woman, and I'm hoping it's a woman of color as well."
2730,Don't think so. It was fairly obvious beforehand he was going to pick a female VP and then he confirmed it. He won't backtrack and he shouldn't.
2731,¬°VIVA LA FIDEL!
2732,Oh for fucks sakes... Business as usual.
2733,"While Biden will definitely bring out voters, as he has demonstrated in the primaries, it's best to not take any chances when so much is at stake.

After all, polls had Clinton winning Wisconsin back in 2016, only for the state to narrowly go for Trump on election day. The same happened in Pennsylvania and Michigan.

I did some reading on Baldwin, and she definitely seems qualified. And she's even part of the LGBT community, which in my view would make her perfect for ripping the rabid homophobe Mike Pence during the debates.

Biden has many good choices in the list you provided, but I think picking Baldwin will guarantee Wisconsin and leave him to spend more resources in Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania."
2734,I'd appreciate some sources on your statement. I'd like to read about it.
2735,"This is a pro Joe sub, not anti sanders. Stay positive and don‚Äôt post stuff like this here.

We‚Äôre gonna get a lot of refugees soon."
2736,"Disagree.  Klobuchar is popular in the states that Biden needs to win.  Someone like Warren will help him win bright blue states by even bigger margins, but that's not what he needs."
2737,"Biden is still on an upswing (his poll averages continue to increase), and Bernie is still falling. 

Vote anyways! It's not over until Bernie drops out. Every delegate Biden wins brings that eventuality closer."
2738,"You replied to the wrong comment numb nuts 

ü§°ü§°ü§°"
2739,"If BS drops out, the rest of the states can move their primaries to June and do them by mail."
2740,"It was probably that and his lackluster performance in other states. A series of endorsements and a great debate night probably helped Biden in the final moments of the race. 

A lot of people forget most voters outside of Iowa don‚Äôt make up their minds until 24-48 hours before voting. Now is the time campaigns have a serious discussion on if they should stay in the race."
2741,I thought this said Selina Meyers for a second and I was like well duh
2742,"I don't disagree - I don't think Joe needed to do a lot in order for it to be considered a win for him (though imo he did pretty good). It's more that the prevailing sentiment among Sanders' supporters was that Joe would get stomped in a 1v1 with Bernie and have his supposed ""cognitive decline"" and lack of stamina exposed, in addition to getting routed on policy. They were positive this was going to be Joe's downfall, but the result was the complete opposite."
2743,Joe Biden would forget that coronavirus exists lmfao
2744,"I would love to see Yang for, Amy for, Beto for, etc shirts like this!"
2745,"Shouting about things that should happen is the only thing Bernie knows how to do. It's such an effective strategy, it's led to him introducing &amp; passing a whopping **3 bills** **over his entire career** as senator."
2746,Sanders need to drop out so we can focus on trump. No repeat of 2016 where he stands in even after it's mathematically impossible to win. And his supporters scream rig and make conspiracies etc. I hope Sanders can put his ego aside for the better of the country.
2747,"I didn't watch it, 'cuz I was hanging out with my significant other, and I am *so* over this damn primary. 

I'm assuming it went well, because I don't see anything about it in r/all."
2748,"Already jumping the gun before the elections we have Democrats elected in *Montana* and * West Virginia*. Two states that are way redder than Indiana a state Obama won in 2008 and a state that had Joe Donelly in the Senate before 2018.

Pete Buttigieg is a smart person definitely second only to Warren in that department among 2020 candidates. However it is **not in the slightest unrealistic to run for Statewide office before the Presidency**. The mayorship of a mid size town in Indiana in no way qualifies someone to be President of the United States.

2752,"Welcome to the discussion!

My wife's family are of Bohemian descent, and we rented a little black Skoda and toured your country for 9 days a few years ago. Breathtaking place, and the people were all so friendly.  Probably our favorite foreign country we've visited.

Where about are you from?"

2758,Look at my profile it's my second most recent post lol. Don't look at the comments look at the post.
2759,"He wanted to increase social security. From what I'm reading in other anti-Bernie articles, ""incremental adjustments"" is being interpreted as potential cuts because of ""as Congress has done in the past,"" but *""For most of the history of Social Security in the following decades, changes to the program were ones of expansion.""* (https://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/crsleghist2.html) And literally everything in this op-ed is about preserving Social Security (opposing cuts to Medicare etc., focusing cuts on corporate welfare and military spending instead, helping the elderly with economic security). How is this damning? It's the same thing he has always said. This just reinforces his consistency."
2760,"OP, there's no such thing as a ""former"" YangGanger. You can be YangGang and still support Joe Biden.

That being said, there's a greater chance Biden is considering Yang to be VP because of Yang's appeal and plus Biden and Yang have developed a friendship throughout the campaign. Yang said Biden's the closest to him, and they have phone calls just about every week."
2761,Has he really?
2762,"While not directly related to the Biden *per se*, it's directly related to the nasty online rhetoric Joe Biden must now embattle and we must fight."
2763,"I‚Äôm concerned that Joe might get it.

I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs taking plenty of precautions.  But with things like Bernie insisting on an in-person debate in a studio with no audience but plenty of crew I think I‚Äôm right to be worried.

If it weren‚Äôt for that, Joe could just announce that he‚Äôs going to run the campaign from his house for the next month and ride the momentum all the way to the nomination."
2764,"I understand the results in 2018 favored Democrats, but a wave election in a midterm doesn't always translate to a general election win.  Dems got wiped out in 2010, but Obama still won in 2012.  Plus Republicans are a cult, once their Dear Leader is actually on the ballot, I think you'll see a lot more MAGA hats.  

I think the question is, can Joe Biden inspire younger voters who stayed home in 2016?  Hillary really under-performed among young voters, and African Americans, when compared to Obama.  Maybe you're right, and it was just anti-Hillary sentiment, but if Biden's numbers look like her's, it might mean that younger people aren't buying what the Democrats are selling"
2765,"I think it would be a smart move. She's a woman, a mom, a vet, from a military AND immigrant family...it would be a smart choice to get both sides to vote for you."
2766,Here's to many more ü•Ç
2767,That‚Äôs very cool. I hope everyone brings some of the strengths of each individual campaign they were part of into Biden‚Äôs.
2768,Let‚Äôs sum this up about Hillary since we playing identity politics. A white woman lost to a black man with the name Barack Obama In the primary. Let that sink in for a moment so you can stop running with the ‚Äúshe lost because she‚Äôs a woman‚Äù thing.
2769,It's pretty clearly a best case scenario dream.
2770,Equivocating between nostalgia for a time when women were treated as baby incubators and civil rights didn't really exist to the Obama presidency is probably about as dumb as expected from leftist trolls. Pathetic.

2779,"This is actually a great, fair question I haven't heard before. I'll try to give you an answer later but it goes without saying that he'd clean house from Trump-appointed partisan scum hacks and replace them with good progressives. Since he's been in the political realm for so long and has 4 years of White House experience, this might be one of his biggest strengths."
2780,"He talks about his speech disorder. The problem is that people flatly refuse to listen (ironically enough). Fortunately, come the general election, when Saint Bernard is gone, people will hear Joe's  story. If Donald Fucking Trump with his middle-school-bully vocabulary criticizes Joe for speech patterns on stage, that glass house is gonna be shattered real quick."
2781,You ever wonder why Bernie supporters talk about their insights into trumps following so confidently?  Because it takes one to know one.

2797,"In what state that Trump won would Clinton have won if she got 100% of Stein's votes?

Edit: Spoiler, it's none. Stein was getting 1-2% in a lot of states, but the closest one where she got over 1% was Arizona. Trump won by 3.6% and Stein only had 1.3% of the vote. Gary Johnson got 4% there, which could have flipped the state, though he would be splitting with Trump as well.

The votes to 3rd parties were so low, and margins of victories in individual states so large (for the most part) that vote splitting had no real impact on the outcome of the election."

Also, the mans worked through a stutter his whole life and has never been too great of a speaker. My grandpa died of Alzheimer‚Äôs and it sure as hell didn‚Äôt look like Joe."
2807,Ok. My point is that I just can't sympathize with ignoring the candidate to focus on the community when voting for a candidate.

2811,He considered it. And he decided against it. At least for now
2812,From your lips to all the gods ears.
2813,Have you not heard Trump and his many minions claim that COVID is a hoax to get a Dem elected?
2814,"I wonder if that's going to come into play in the PA primary, not that it will likely matter by the time that goes down.  UPMC is the largest employer in the state if I'm not mistaken."
2815,That would be devastating to Sanders to even have it this close.
2816,I heard that even Kids Pick the President might be in trouble.
2817,Senators get a pension. Also mutual funds should be acceptable because they are externally managed.
2818,"So he did mention ND then, why didn't you say so."
2819,"I think a big part of the problem is that people don't know that he has a speech impediment, because he manages it very well. When you don't know that's what he's doing and you see him struggle to get a sentence out, it seems like he's forgotten what he was saying. The gaffes he makes don't help.

I'm not saying there's not also a lot of bad faith attacks. But I feel like they need to somehow make people more aware of his speech impediment to alleviate this concern. Not sure what the best way to do that is."
2820,"Texas is fools gold. I hope he doesn't pour resources into it. Arizona,, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin would be much easier to win. If he can win those 3 he probably wins the election."
2821,"But how do you explain his nonsense speech and the fact that he forgets what he says? I want a lucid candidate not somebody that forgets what he says. I need an explanation for that. Bernie and Trump compared to Biden sound very lucid they know what they are talking about and yes both can dodge questions but they still make sense when they give an answer. Trump may sound like a lunatic but he actually knows what he's talking about. Sanders is also lucid and keeps on focus during his speech, Biden forgets what he says pretty often and because of the race and all the travel campaign and debates I believe it will get worse unless the DNC start postponing debates or Joe stops going. I know this will get a thumbs down but at least I need an explanation, thanks."
2822,Bloomberg's attack ads against Trump were golden. Thats all we need him to do. Leave the positive campaigning to Biden.
2823,"I mentioned you in another comment elsewhere in the thread because I would really like to address your question.

2824,"There are a lot of unknowns about using a Wall Street speculation tax to pay for anything. Sanders may have an estimate of what he might get, but it's far from certain. And yes, the U.S. did have a tax like this up to 1966, but the financial markets look quite a bit different now.

And no one knows how it will affect index funds that have to be balanced daily  nor how it will affect pension funds. My Roth is in an index fund and the last thing I need is for it to lose value at this stage in my life. And my employer still has a pension fund that's in pretty good shape right now.

I'm not saying it won't work, but I will say that there are far too many unknowns about how the rest of the financial sector will respond."

2830,"I would have voted for anyone who got the nomination and wouldn't have lost any sleep over it, but I was Biden or Buttigieg from the very beginning. I can own the fact that I'm a neoliberal shill; the ""establishment"" narrative leaves me cold. I want the establishment. I want the *old* establishment, the one we had before Trump decided to ""drain the swamp."" I'm from Florida. I *like* the swamp, it has snowy egrets. Well, forgive me the slightly tortured metaphor, but as awful as this sounds, ""opaque bureaucracy riddled with power politics, venal careerists, and a soupcon of graft and nepotism, all overseen from on high by elected officials with strong democratic mandates who give out broad directives"" is, alas, unfortunately, *the most effective and just political system in the history of the world.* Bureaucratic politics is the price of having people who know what they're doing, and it's what we've got. I trust Biden to work with this machine more than I trust anyone else to destroy and remake it.

All I really want is a new version of the Obama administration, ideally with a more compliant Congress.

Look, I have two big issues. Issue number 1 is the environment and the climate, but I don't think any Democrat really has a strong pull-away advantage on that. Issue number 2 is diplomacy and foreign affairs. Trump has spent the last four years radiating hostility towards the rest of the world, turning friends into enemies and boosting the profile of our actual enemies. First and foremost, I trust Joe to find common ground with the rest of the democratic world and rebuild our connections with our allies. (I would like a president who would stand up to Saudi Arabia and demand they begin reforms, but let's get real - nobody was ever going to do that.)

And people bring up his gaffes, his clownish moments. So what? Look at the White House; clowns are what's on the menu, and I would rather have a gentle clown who can laugh at himself than a cruel one who laughs at the misfortunes of others."
2831,The people spreading that misinformation don't think about that he can't hold rallies. They probably still think covid 19 is a hoax or over exaggerated
2832,She will turn off many Americans. She has done horrible things.
2833,"I think you're seeing int he voting turnout that Sanders is really not the better choice though.  He has some super passionate supporters, but really isn't able to reach many people outside that set of believers.

Biden, on the hand, represents a more stable choice to restore the US to the normal that has really been pretty good to all of us over the last bunch of decades.  That doesn't mean that there are no challenges, nor that everything is still moving in the right direction, but on the whole most Americans have a pretty decent life.  For example, if one of your big problems is student loan debt it means that everything else in your life was sufficiently good that you were able to go and complete college.  That doesn't mean that the debt is not a real issue that causes real problems for people, but the conditions that let that problem arise put a decent floor under how bad your life can be.

So I prefer Biden to Sanders at least in part because I think that the systems in the US have helped a lot of people live pretty good lives, so I have no desire to revolt against it or burn the whole thing down.  I want to keep improving it to handle situations that could be even better, or to fix places where the systems are being abused, but that is very different from thinking that we need to have a revolution to improve people's lives."

I Just got home from the Dallas event. Here are some impressions:

-It was packed. The venue held around 3500 people. When my wife and I got there there were easily 3,000+ in line. Over the next hour the line probably grew by another 2k people or more. We were one of the last ones let in and there were easily 1500+ people still outside. 

-Everyone in line was super nice and excited. Honestly, at least in our section of the line, there were TONS of Buttigieg supporters. There were lots of Pete shirts and signs in the crowd. Pete‚Äôs endorsement definitely made an impact on the turnout at the rally.

-The event itself was really energetic. Amy got a good reaction and you could tell she was emotional and everyone was supportive of her. 

-Joe was the best I‚Äôve seen him. He was energized. He is obviously feeding off the energy of the endorsements. I was impressed with him. It definitely felt like this was the start of something special.

-Joe needs to employ Beto as official campaign hype man. 

-Overall, really great energy and there was a sense in the crowd that we‚Äôre going to make this happen. The fact that you had supporters from all these other candidates show up to one location, be super friendly with each other, and move their support to a different candidate was really something to witness. 

-On the way out  there were two Bernie supporters holding giant signs and screaming at people that they‚Äôre throwing their vote away. It was a very stark contrast to the positivity and belonging that was shared inside the event. Was interesting to witness. Couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if they are unaware they are doing more harm than good of if they are aware and are doing it because of some internal anger and desire for confrontation. 

-After we passed the Bernie supporters we found ourselves walking next to a mother and her little son. The little guy was wearing a Pete shirt. He was clearly bummed that Pete wasn‚Äôt at the event. (I think many of us shared his disappointment) But his mother was explaining to him that Pete was going to work with Joe. It was heart warming. So thanks little dude for making us smile."

I‚Äôve not heard any official announcement of Beto being the gun guy other than Biden telling him he‚Äôd like his input. Beto wasn‚Äôt just a pseudo sympathetic figurehead after the San Antonio massacre. He once again was on the ground where a true leader should be (I.e. not babbling endlessly on twitter and offering empty and meaningless thoughts and prayers). 

Trump will say what he needs to do appease his unhinged base. Voter turnout on Super Tuesday was a fairly good indicator the American people have grown tired of Trump and his smear tactics.They‚Äôve grown even more tired of mass shootings."

2870,"&gt; But once quarantine is lifted, and a vaccine is created, businesses will open up again and need workers because that demand never went away

So you seem to portraying a scenario where the recovery is going to be really quick once the quarantine lifts. This is probably where I think you're incorrect. The dip may be ""artificial"". But the businesses that close during it won't come right away like nothing happened. It's going to take months or even years for the economy to get back to where it was before the virus started. The value of the Federal stimulus is it's going to shorten that recovery period. Lots of people are going to be unemployed at the end of the quarantine. We need policies that lessen the burden on the unemployed and give more disposable income to the employed so they can spend money and speed up the recovery.

I agree that the method you describe of forgiving student loans would be harmful to private lenders. That's not what I'm advocating for. I'm not suggesting the government wipe out people's debt with private lenders. I'm not even sure that would be possible. Loan forgiveness can take on many forms. The government can forgive loans made as part of the Direct Loan program, without harming private lenders, since that money was directly appropriated by Congress. For government backed loans from private lenders, the government could repay a portion of those loans to the lenders. They're already guaranteeing the loans anyway."
2871,"I don't know about that but it wouldn't surprise me...he didn't invite Jesse to the White House.

2875,"You stopped reading after like three words, huh? I'm not the one who needs to learn something, pal."
2876,"Mhm, and soon enough he'll get wiped by Trump in the general once people realize Biden's a neocon with dementia üòéüá∫üá∏"
2877,"While I agree with Biden's sentiment I think I would have criticized Trump if he said 'you're full of shit' to someone he disagreed with (although I recognize the difference between an honest disagreement and someone misrepresenting your position entirely). A president, or in this case a presidential candidate, should be calm in the face of anger imo. This won't really hurt Biden though as it will be seen as a  'tell it like it is' moment in the primary. No one will remember it by the general."
2878,And giving free college just acts as a wealth transfer from students to admin. Exactly why I didn't support it in the primary.
2879,Open it in a private tab
2880,That is probably not enough people. I am talking about people who don't fit that description
2881,But do we know that for sure? Seems to me we‚Äôre just assuming what‚Äôs went on in ignorance of what Biden said outright

2883,Where's the other 16%?
2884,"Still bittersweet; bitter to possibly never have the chance to see Pete succeed (I‚Äôm old), and sweet to see the vitriol of Sanders‚Äôs ‚Äúbros‚Äù not be rewarded for their behavior."
2885,"Until I saw this debate I was glad Sanders was still in the race so he could continue to promote things like Medicare for all. But instead he attacked Biden from the left which will only help Trump. That‚Äôs not good. 

Especially with his continued misrepresentation of Biden‚Äôs stance on social security. Very bad."
2886,"Yeah, I live in a red state without the Medicaid expansion (at least so far, they might be coming around to it) so it's really top of mind for me. Whenever I see these partially-funded-at-the-Federal-level plans it jumps out at me.

It's not Free College for All, it's Free College for Wealthy Blue States. And that sucks."
2887,Yeah I know but I barley have anything but pull-up bar and some 10lb weight plates so I rather lift heavy as I can until gym closed which apparently is tonight. Started repping 225 for reps on bench press and didn‚Äôt want to just stop progress.
2888,"Bernie is a ""spitfire"" but that's not something to be proud of.  A president needs to be someone whom know how to build coalitions, coerce the reluctant and strong arm the holdouts.  Bernie is none of those.  He is selfish, divisive and unyielding.   We need a candidate, like Joe, who is focused on building a future that is inclusive,  aspirational and healing.  You have to remember most americans are living a very high quality of life, and while we want better healthcare, human rights and moral leadership - we still have a lot that we are afraid to lose.  We don't want a candidate that is focused on burning it down, we want someone to fix it."
2889,At what point do you expect us to fight back?
2890,"It worked! Thank you, will listen when I get home!"
2891,Yeah because Republicans are always so careful to avoid difficult constitutional breaches
2892,"The voters have seen 8-9 debates. This has been going on since spring. There is zero a voter needs to know that they don‚Äôt already know.

Joe can start the general election after tomorrow"
2893,Welcome!
2894,"quite a few actually switched and voted trump. Youre making the same mistake democrats made in 2016. Thinking progressives are too small a group to matter. When in fact if they had voted hillary or even just stayed home instead of voting for trump hillary would have won.

2895,"As a Bernie supporter who would support Joe Biden in the general if that's the way it goes, defeating Trump is not my primary objective. Trump got elected because enough of the country was so dissatisfied with how the Democrats, through poor trade deals and the ACA, failed to address the needs of poorer and rural Americans that they voted for an outsider that they thought would fix it. Trump lied, obviously, but that's no surprise. I'm more concerned with addressing the issues that allowed Trump to gain as much popularity as he did, or we'll see someone else promising to clean house again very soon.

The ACA hit many people's wallets hard, it's not THAT affordable and still can result in costly co-pays and high deductibles. I see expansion of it as a bandaid fix that won't resolve their issues and I think M4A would be a better solution. Unfortunately, focusing on only defeating Trump is reactive, not proactive. I'd like to see more talk about solutions instead of just, ""Trump is a bigot who must be stopped at all costs"""
2896,We need to change the vocabulary. The phrase pro-life needs to be changed to anti-choice. They use the phrase pro-life because it makes pro-choice people sound anti-life.

2900,Yes...it‚Äôs brilliant!

2903,"Not saying it's because she's a woman but...  

Well aside from probable sexism, I think she has the progressive cred while still having realistic plans to get things enacted.  This makes her a threat to Bernie in a lot of ways, and she doesn't have the baggage of being a self-described socialist either.  Add on a far less toxic fanbase and it makes her look much more palatable than him to the awful Establishment.  Of course they vilify her when she doesn't endorse him but then say they don't need her anyway, but also Bernie would be winning if she had."
2904,You're a Texan whats your feel about Bloombergs support? Is it real? How much support does he actually have? Are poll overestimating him or underestimating?
2905,Exactly. Strong leadership and a sense of responsibility.
2906,Thanks for adopting ROTR I am hoping we could credit Pete tho. Either way I am pumped to go canvas for Biden in April when we get closer to the PA primary.
2907,It‚Äôs pretty hard to listen to this interview and not want this man to be President. I‚Äôve never heard several of the personal stories he shares here. I also love the goofy and fun side he shows!
2908,Outlandish or not... Trump will use it against him just like the email hack with Hilary.

2913,"I hope this is not one of those rhetorical questions where you already have made up your mind on what to believe like so many of folks on Bernie-subreddits.

But here's why all women should be heard but not all allegations should be trusted.

I didn't have to do a ton of digging on this particular instance - Tara Reade alleged last year (April 2019) that Joe acted inappropriate with his body contact and she was one of the eight women who complained about Joe's behaviors. Okay, Joe has been known to not be cognizant of his personal space but far from a sexual predator.

Just about one year later, Tara Reade, the woman who alleged Joe touched her inappropriately, drops a bombshell that Joe used his finger to penetrate her genital. Where was this last year? Furthermore, I'm more than weary of these less than mainstream outlets picking up scoops - these outlets have every reason to rely on poor sourcing to be the first one to raise the flag. If you are successful, you get remembered as the next big thing and if you are unsuccessful, what have you got to lose? Prof. Blasey Ford was both vetted by WaPo and local congresswoman who then escalated to Senator Feinstein.

Then again, you may have made up your mind already - like I have, an open mind about credible facts rather than pitchfork at the earliest possible opportunity."

The Prime Minister of the Netherlands if from the VVD (which is center-right). Costa, from Portugal, is part of the center left party...which is called the Socialist party....but there are several parties considerably more left wing (the Greens and MAS). Macron is a neoliberal. Belgium is controlled by centrists, and their prime minister is a centrist. 

Most of the major Western European countries do not have a leftist government with the exception of Spain."

2919,"This post describes me exactly, glad to see there other people who saw things the same way."
2920,"What the fuck, they endorsed Tulsi? Kinda explains a lot.

He picked awful people because that's exactly what he wanted. It's not like he didn't know how toxic they were when he hired them. I think he wants to pretend he isn't extreme, but the way he's railed against the ""establishment"" and pretty much everyone else in the Democratic party over the last week or so really revealed a lot of his true colors.

He also has yet to learn the value of working with people outside of his organization."
2921,Can't rule out the republicans. He did say it was an option

The word doesn't mean ""good"" and then you just ratchet it up as far as you can. Same with ""progressive."" Sanders is more ""progressive"" -- so what? If we're using the word to mean ""has more plans to give people free stuff with no idea how to pay for it"" then we shouldn't want someone who is *more* of that."
2924,Bloomberg: allow me to introduce myself
2925,Ohh good I can sleep in tomorrow. /s
2926,I hope a lot does happen. I would gladly trade a Biden presidency for Trump handling the COVID-19 situation well.
2927,Does your hair smell good?
2928,As for how I can vote for him... I plan to use a paper ballot.
2929,"Like others said, I think they keep changing things and it keeps coming up as Bernie having no chance. I feel like they'll publish the most conservative models possible, and it will still show Biden at like 85-90%+"
2930,"Californian here, my very anecdotal personal impression from my friends, family, and coworkers is that she's still fairly popular here among progressives (who aren't super young voters) who see her as the sane progressive alternative to Sanders."
2931,"If I had UBI, all my rent/utilities, car/bike insurance, gas, and bike loan would be covered. It's a pretty big game changer for people that aren't on welfare too. I earn too much ($27,500) to be on assistance programs."
2932,"I really feel sorry for America. 

My country and multiple other countries are shutting down in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus while this guy thinks the economy is more important then human lives.

Even Trump seems to agree.

I dont understand his thinking behind this.

Economies can be rebuild. Lost human lives can not."
2933,"Yet strangely despite Biden having a better chance at a majority and on average winning more delegates, the model thinks Bernie has a slightly better chance at a plurality"

2938,"I have heard two theories about what Democratic voters want, for the past year.

1. Massive changes and reforms to the U.S.
2. A return to peace and quiet, or ""a return to normalcy"" if you will.

I guess we now know which one people actually want. Can't say I blame people for just wanting some quiet, competent leadership instead of a massive revolution (at least not right now). The last 4 years of someone ""shaking up washington"" has been exhausting."
2939,Jobless losers is quite insensitive. There are people losing their employment now because of caronavirus.
2940,"[He‚Äôs also a good son, apparently.](https://twitter.com/riegerreport/status/1239726859647995907?s=21)"
2941,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. Imagine seeing Bernie and Bloomberg up against former VP and one of the longest serving senators Joe Biden and not choosing Joe.
2942,"I have often been asked to define the term ""Black Belt."" So far as I can learn, the term was first used to designate a part of the country which was distinguished by the colour of the soil. The part of the country possessing this thick, dark, and naturally rich soil was, of course, the part of the South where the slaves were most profitable, and consequently they were taken there in the largest numbers. Later, and especially since the war, the term seems to be used wholly in a political sense‚Äîthat is, to designate the counties where the black people outnumber the white.  - Booker T. Washington."
2943,"&gt;I need to see the campaign and the party in general move more left.

I don't get this. Hillary's platform was well to the left of Obama's, and Biden's is left of hers. Sure, none of them are as far left as Sanders, but given that he's the most left-wing mainstream politician in America, that's not surprising."
2944,"Anything to break the rules, defy the Law, and cheat their way into staying in power and use the pandemic as an excuse for Bernie to stay in the race and be nominated in place of Joe. Too bad it won't work. I believe Joe is already nominated. Bernie's too stubborn to admit that he lost and has to drop out now."
2945,"I can tell a little about Ohio, since it's my home state growing up and still have family there: it's incredibly purple, irrespective of the massive gerrymandering that happened in 2010. Democrats in Ohio are not the ""revolution let's burn it down"" type at all. They're pragmatic and most likely former Eisenhower-like Republicans. But today's Republican party is batshit insane, so they've been democrats since W.

It's also Hillary county. So this year it's very likely to be Biden country."

2956,"You're right, if everyone has healthcare it isn't necessary. But until then, every little bit helps.

No blood no foul, though, you're more than welcome to hold your own position on the subject. That was just a policy I found really cool for Biden to hold to."
2957,It's something voters should know and acting like he's some sort of victim because he chose to work at McKinsey is ridiculous.

Also I think the electoral might have a slight anti-establishment bent from 2016 still.  She comes off as more fresh face than insider to balance Bidens establishment creds."

If Bernie was president it would be more unlikely that a Republican would ever get in again because they wouldn't be able to cheat anymore by using the electoral college.

3001,Keep it civil or catch a ban.

3004,"Nah, fuck Bernie Sanders and the Bernie or bust people he actively facilitates. By waiting 2 months after it was mathematically impossible for him to win and by staying in now, I've lost what little respect I had for him."
3005,"This presupposes that they would be inclined to listen to her. I think they wouldn't, Bernie shit on he so much as he does to everyone that they were lost. At some point we need to stop blaming Hillary for not being more entertaining or not pandering enough and blame Bernie for being a demagogue and the voters for being simpletons."
3006,"They said in the days prior to that debate that it was ""rigged"" by the DNC changing it to a seated format because Biden can't stand up (wish I was kidding) and that they still wanted it cancelled because Joe can't talk to any more than 5 to 7 minutes. 

They immediately moved to saying he is a super devious liar then swung back to he can't speak as soon as Trump's folks made some new video compilations. I won't even talk about what they are pushing today as it's so despicable"
3007,To the Hill. Joe says Hold my Beer.
3008,"I wonder if that's true among *young* black people. Because they seem to be sticking with Sanders.

I‚Äôm a staunch supporter of Medicare for all and believe it would improve the economy, a reasonable wealth tax, more affordable/free college (our economy is moving in a direction that needs more college degrees, the country is moving towards service and quaternary jobs), and think that his idea to add a .5% tax to stock exchanges is a great idea. Trust me dude, I‚Äôm a big Bernie supporter. 

It‚Äôs just disheartening to see how many of us are acting like trump supporters, being so focused on our guy that we lose sight of the bigger picture. I think the end of your comment likening trump and Biden as the same and it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt matter at all‚Äù who wins is a great example of that. Biden definitely does NOT have the same policies as trump. Do you really think Biden is going to drain money into a pointless border wall? Is he going to enact a Muslim ban? Is he going to sit by and do nothing about the coronavirus? I don‚Äôt like Biden much either, on a personal level, but this isn‚Äôt personal anymore. It‚Äôs politics. Our best bet, if Bernie doesn‚Äôt win, is to try to work our way towards what we need. It starts with getting Trump out of office before he loads the Supreme Court and the house with Republicans, which will make it even harder to install any progressive values"
3027,Same.
3028,Only one of these guys went on Lou Dobbs tonight.
3029,"What I don‚Äôt think you Joe Biden supporters get yet is that the majority of Bernie will NOT be voting for Biden. 

We are independents, and progressives, and democrats but democrats who only vote for conservatives we believe in, and even conservatives who believe in Bernie. 

We don‚Äôt owe anyone our vote and Biden won‚Äôt be getting it. 

I truly believe that Biden would lose to Trump and Bernie would win. 

Neoliberals are no longer viable as presidential candidates and they will soon be unviable as congressional candidates as well. That was the lesson of 2016 you haven‚Äôt learned."
3030,"There‚Äôs also a lot of young people who support Biden/don‚Äôt support Sanders who don‚Äôt talk about it online because they don‚Äôt want to be destroyed or accused of hating poor people. Me, for one. And several of my friends."
3031,"Hey, we may not always see eye-to-eye, but in the grander scheme we're all in this together. Let us join hands, regardless of who wins, and walk hand in hand to help keep the US on the right side of history."
3032,"Healthcare is the most serious and urgent issue. I think most people can agree with that. 

Truthfully, most people don‚Äôt want a revolution (nor would one happen). That‚Äôs not the way to build."
3033,The Democratic party damaged its ability to beat Trump the moment they realized that they make more money from letting Trump win against guaranteed-loss candidates.
3034,"Biden is the one who put them in there in the first place, wtf"
3035,"""Some of you may die, but that's a sacrifice I am willing to make."""

Why? The Patriots are so much better!"
3039,Just wait till Bloomberg‚Äôs pac is finished.
3040,"&gt;I am loving his message about him being the bridge for the future of the Democratic party

That kind of sounds like you think the US needs to have a government that provides more help to the people, but that something is stopping us and Biden isn't what you want, but you can't get what you want. I'm not trying to disagree, I just want to make sure I really understand you clearly and that I don't have the wrong idea."
3041,Welcome!‚ô•Ô∏è

3043,And we are the mean ones?

3050,Please don't vote green party. We need to defeat trump before we can make anything better. The more people who vote third party the worse our chances are.
3051,"Im tired of excitement. I want to sleep soundly at night knowing a competent, caring man is working on my behalf."
3052,Remember when people we‚Äôre attacking Obama at a McCain rally and he just shut them up and told him how Obama was a good family man?
3053,"If the implicit question here is why I am still picking Biden over Bernie,

It's because even  though I feel like what happened here is a wrong move it's nonething compared to the nationally damaging narrative coming out of Sanders camp. A narrative that is starting at the top. 

The whole idea that the media is fake and biased whenever they say something that is not 100 percent positive about Bernie.

The idea that anytime anything happens not in Bernie's favor that it's somehow the ""establishments"" fault. Everything is the establishment. 

The idea that any liberal who is not him is somehow a snake or rat or not a true liberal.

The whole us vs them mentality is the exact thing Trump does. Can you even imagine two candidates on stage who both claim the media is fake and that the establishment is against them both? That is so ridiculous lol"
3054,Everyone loves votes by mail in Washington. Security is not an issue for anyone that I know.
3055,"You're still insisting that being more charismatic and good at campaigning is somehow magical evidence that he is more suited to be president. That is not the case.

&gt; More people are willing to vote for a woman than for a gay candidate

The evidence suggests that this isn't true. Bringing up that he's gay doesn't negate sexism. If Americans are less willing to vote for a less qualified gay man than a woman it just supports that sexism is a factor.

Having access to classified information in and of itself doesn't mean that much, do you really think that any of the candidates running were people who would be security risks if given access to classified information? I have no idea what your point is here."
3056,awesome!
3057,Genuine question here (I'm an immigrant from the more libertarian-leaning side of the Yang Gang): Why should the government be involved in subsidizing raising a family? My instinct is to put a firewall between the government and family decisions because I believe that when people are asked to pay for something they (quite reasonably) start to want to have a say in it.
3058,Depends on the Senate
3059,"Cool, thank you!"
3060,"As someone who lives two blocks outside her former district (unfortunately my rep is far more milquetoast), and is now represented by her in the Senate, I completely agree.  Total class, great experience."

3084,Biden acknowledges younger people and offers very good input. Bernie supporters will say he‚Äôs pandering. There‚Äôs no winning with them and the fact that polls show 85% will vote Biden just shows they‚Äôre a very vocal minority.
3085,There was lots of reactions from Democrats in Congress regarding that decision. The reason why you saw ‚Äúlack of reaction from much of the DNC‚Äù is because that‚Äôs not the DNC‚Äôs job.

I don't believe it's 100% legitimate Sanders supporters tweeting snake emojis at Elizabeth Warren, claiming that Buttigieg is only pretending to be gay, or retweeting clips of Biden speaking that have been edited to make him sound more senile.

&gt;most people dont need Russian bots to tell them not to vote for michael bloomberg

Correct, Bloomberg is a piece of shit.

&gt;Most supporters are concerned with the DNC allowing someone else to become the nominee even if Bernie goes into the convention with a plurality.

Yeah, conspiracy theories about The DNC ""rigging"" the primary are a major point that Russian trolls pushed in 2016. They're doing it again.

&gt; a nominee that is appointed against the will of voters.

Yeah, no. If Candidate A gets 40%, Candidate B gets 30% and Candidate C gets 30%, automatically handing the nomination to a candidate who most voters *did not* vote for is in no way ""upholding the will of the voters"".

If Marine Le Pen had edged out Emmanual Macron in the first round of the 2017 French Presidential election with 25% of the vote should she have been inaugurated on the spot? Even though the second round revealed that no more than 34% preferred her over Macron once the field was narrowed to two candidates?

If David Duke had beaten Edwin Edwards in the first round of the 1991 Louisiana Gubernatorial election *which he came quite close to doing*, should he have become Governor? Even though Edwards won by a 20%+ margin in the second round?

*Ideally* what would happen is that it would go to a runoff with the top 2 vote-getters competing head-to-head, just like in France and Louisiana. This is what happens in lots of State and Municipal elections, including primaries, but it doesn't happen in Presidential primaries. 

Instead there's the antiquated convention method where the delegates, elected by the voters to represent the interests of their given candidate's voting bloc, continue to vote on additional ballots. Candidates can choose to keep their delegates bound to them for as long as they wish, but afterwards the delegates get to choose for themselves who they want to vote for. This is exactly what the *evil* super-delegates do once they're introduced in the second round, and they aren't any more undemocratic than the ordinary delegates are, as they are ultimately elected by voters. Every sitting Democratic member of Congress, and every Democratic Governor is a super-delegate, the others are DNC members who are elected in state/local primaries.

These are really stupid rules. I don't know why the rules are this way. I didn't have a hand in writing them, [but you know who did?](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/bernie-had-a-big-hand-in-writing-these-rules-i-didnt-write-them/ar-BB10vT9s)

These are the rules that everyone running in the primary agreed to when they registered. They don't get to complain now because they aren't getting preferential treatment.

&gt;having basic principles and respect for the democratic process

**Nothing less than an outright majority reflects a mandate from the voters** (see any number of runoff elections where the original plurality winner lost) - and even then a narrow majority of convention delegates might not, given some of the idiotic rules for delegate distribution which lead to Buttigieg receiving the largest number of delegates from Iowa despite losing the raw vote count or Bernie receiving nearly 70% of the delegates from Nevada with just over 40% of the final round vote. But at this point we're splitting hairs.

&gt;But let's not pretend there isnt a never bernie movement out there with plenty of Democrats saying they wouldn't support him. Are those just russian trolls too though?

Yes, sadly those people do exist, and I am **certain** that Russians and Republicans will work hard to signal boost them if Sanders ends up being the nominee. They're probably doing so already.

&gt;Memes arent convincing Bernie supporters to not like Pete, Amy, Bloomberg, Warren, or Biden. It's who they are or their policies or both.

There's no shortage of people out there who are convinced that Pete Buttigieg is a ""secret Republican"" or that Bernie is literally Stalin because of something they read on Twitter. I think you're seriously underestimating the effect that online echo chambers and filter bubbles can have on individual opinions. I'm not immune, and neither are you. The best way to combat this is to engage directly with people who disagree with you. Like you and I are doing now.

I don't think you're an idiot. I don't think you're brainwashed. I hope you have a similar opinion of me.

Apologies if there are any typos, I'm a little tipsy right now.

Have a great weekend."

3110,"You can see the core policies on the right hand column or just browse www.joebiden.com/joes-vision

TL;DR: Joe wants to give America public option that will completely cover low income Americans for free, pass a version of the Green New Deal, make it easier for people to immigrate here legally, create a path to citizenship for those who are undocumented, host a global democracy summit to reassure our commitment to our democratic allies push back against a world that seems to be trending towards autocracy, and make LGBTQ rights a core part of our foreign policy."

3113,"(1) The dems haven't done anything 2 the progressives. Coming together is called tactics. Bernie and his people should've known this and been ready for it. 

(b) Bernie should've changed his message to be much broader and friendlier in order to gain more followers and have access to Warren's total voters. They didn't. Bernie called her a liar and then his supporters are attacking her supporters.

That's called failure. Complete and utter lost of tactics and command.

Joe played it well and smooth and used his very solid mental capabilities to put together a group of moderates. It's the smart play. 

Joe succeeded and Bernie didn't.

I'm sorry that you got hurt in the process, but that's politics and that's the kinda thing we're going to need to fight the republicans. So be a bit more forgiving and kind. Honey will unlock many doors, vinegar not so much."

Can I just say how the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù narrative pisses me off. NO. Voters deserve better. Biden won super Tuesday because the Voters showed up for him.

American voters deserve better. They don‚Äôt deserve to be treated as if they don‚Äôt have minds of their own and can be manipulated by the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù and the ‚Äúmainstream media‚Äù. Just no.

Biden won Super Tuesday because Voters believed in his cause, not because they were told to do so.

They are socialists, it isn‚Äôt just a label they‚Äôre using

3164,"I guess you can call Virginia and North Carolina swing states, I don't think there is a chance of them swinging. They swung for Obama but North Carolina and gone republican 9/10 of the last elections.

Either way we aren't arguing about anything the results will be the results. I'm just saying im pretty sure Biden will get wrecked in the general as he doesn't inspire anyone and the more he talks the worse he will do, and Trump will depress the vote against him and get his people to turn out."

And from how late voters have been going the last few weeks we'll probably see Biden gain and Sanders drop some."
3171,"Multiple women are accusing Biden of sexual assault and there are endless photos of him creepily touching children. The chances of him winning when they are running non stop ads about his sexual assaults is going to torpedo him. Republicans don't care about voting for a sexual predator, but moderates and progressives do."
3172,"At the same time in all the Bernie subs (including r-politics) they are lusting for the Dallas county recount to boost Bernie back to a win lol.

3174,"That doesn't address the cost of going to an emergency room. Legislation for free testing was BARELY passed three days ago. Before that, as I said before, it was nonuniform across the country. Depending where you were, there was no guarantee that someone without insurance (or even WITH insurance at an out-of-network facility) would have their fees waived wherever they go. And that's just for TESTS. As far as I know, there is still no guarantee besides Pence's words that people won't be getting billed for other things. 

There are also more tests than are being administered. That could just be precaution, but we cannot discount the possibility of people with severe symptoms not getting tested before because of fear of cost or being told to go somewhere else. 

Regardless, these arguments and downvotes are not proving that we wouldn't have been better off with M4A, which is the point. Being limited to emergency rooms is worse than being able to see ANYONE with the ability to administer the test or give treatment. Having to be directed to a particular place based on your insurance is worse than having EVERY place available. Paying ANYTHING for the test AND treatment (or not knowing what kind of costs you're walking into) is worse than paying NOTHING outside of taxes. ""It didn't work in Italy"" is just not a good rebuttal at all. Remember how this discussion started. It's not about M4A being perfect and a solution to COVID-19. It's about Bernie making the point that it could've been handled better under universal healthcare, Biden responding with a reductionist comment about it not ""working""(by what standards?)  in Italy, and people then praising him for it as if it made sense."

Yes I'm sure every independent is going to rally for Bernie like every Bernie supporter rallied for him this far in the primaries.

&gt;People are going to continue to want change

You keep saying change as if there's some singular definition that everyone wants for change. Not everyone wants the same change as Bernie's supporters, clearly a majority don't.

&gt;Ignores the fact that the major factor in this election is consistently ""Electability"" and not ""Policy"" 

Have you ever wondered that maybe these two things go hand in hand? lol

&gt;Just stating there why the Dems have been losing in the past 40 years.

Thank you for your expert commentary.

&gt;Unfortunately at current I am ineligible! and like, not rich. Makes things difficult.

You need to use some quotes my man. What are you ineligible for? Biden's healthcare plan? The one where he expands medicare and medicaid for those under 138% of the poverty line, provides a public healthcare option and ensures healthcare expenses aren't more than 8.5% of a household's income? 

&gt;I was watching Obama take the ""high road"" and not fight the Republicans on such a critical issue. 

Tell me how Bernie was going to get any of his proposals through during a Republican majority House and a Republican majority Senate. I'd love to hear it. 

&gt;If Obama refused to do it, how do I expect Biden to appoint a SC Justice when the Republicans block it for bullshit reasons. 

How would Bernie do it? Everything you're crowing about applies just as well to Bernie. 

&gt;Policies that do little, surprisingly, do little.

Policies that no one wants to pass do nothing at all. The difference between Joe and Bernie right now is that one of them can form a coalition for their policies, and the other is Bernie."
3222,"Looking back, other than trying to get healthcare passed, Obama was extreme centrist. He didn't even wanna jump on pushing for LGBTQ+ rights until Biden supported it"
3223,"I've been using the word mollywhop lately. No idea what prompted it really, outside of becoming more involved as the primary season began and Uncle Joe's old style phrases. 

In honor of that, let's just say he'd take Trump out back and mollywhop him after PE."
3224,Joe Rogan isn't alt-right. He's had a lot of democratic candidates on his show and shows support for many of their ideas.
3225,"Yes, Sanders is the is indeed the oldest candidate, but that doesn't exactly make Biden a hot blooded youngster. It isn't comforting nor will it be easy to hide that he's 77 years old just because Bernie happens to be even older.

Plus Joe's age shows when he speaks. He's already had several gaffes in this primary season.

And the other problem is, moderates do a horrible job of energizing voters. Hillary and her campaign proved absolutely helpless against Trump base. They simply had zero answer to the 'crooked Hillary' slogans.

I hope Biden has an Army as energized as Trump because Hillary's army proved absolutely useless."
3226,Yeah right.
3227,"Your childish name-calling is not helping your tenuous argument.

3232,Biden has to drop out of his first run for president after spouting lies about his education and class standing at graduation. His credibility wouldn‚Äôt hold much water if that‚Äôs the angle you think should be played.
3233,Wow Biden's avenger squad getting bigger
3234,"Uhhh there's a lot of views between Bernie's socialism and Trump's authoritarianism. Like most of the views of the world. Why do you think the only two possibilities are the two extremes? You can think healthcare is important, but not think it should just be free for everybody paid for by increased taxes. You can think the environment is important, but not think intermediate term solutions like nuclear power are the devil. So that's why not Bernie. Not Trump because he doesn't care about issues in the first place."
3235,"She kind of is, dude"
3236,"Complete failure at expanding his base in four years is a big one.

3244,"Imagine being so privileged in your life that voting for Joe ""Nothing will Fundamentally Change"" Biden is good enough for you.

Now, imagine people so poor, destitute, and downtrodden that status quo isn't enough for them.

This isn't an attack on Biden or anyone who supports him.  He's quite obviously a better candidate than Trump.  But what folks like you are missing is that a lot of Sanders' support is from people who have been failed, time and time again, by broken promises from both sides (not equally broken promises, mind you) and they're at a point that enough is enough.

For these people, Trump is like someone walking up to a panhandler and punching them in the gut, while Biden is the guy who stops at the light and desperately tries to avoid eye contact, not even acknowledging that there's a human there.

To call someone like this ""Privileged"" is a huge disconnect from what attracts people to Sanders' platform and what turns them off from bothering to come out and vote (and I simply refuse to believe there's a significant quantity of people who honestly support Sanders' platform but will vote for Trump otherwise, aside from 4chan trolls who have Alfred's ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" speech memorized and view it as a life ambition).

Until Biden and his team recognize this disconnect and figure out how to address it, he simply won't gain enough 'independent' support to beat Trump's loony tunes show in November."
3245,Biden did win based on consensus. Mostly because he was winning before heading into the debate and people just want to see how he performs. And he did better than expected
3246,"FALSE!

The media is after Bernie!"
3247,Deceitful. Trying sound compassionate when I‚Äôm reality he doesn‚Äôt give a shit. Americans think they should elect a president based on how good he is at emulating a ‚Äúconfident empathetic man‚Äù when in reality the only thing that matters is their politics. Biden lies several times about his political career tonight. What an empathetic human being.

Literally nothing like that is happening. Stop getting your news from the likes of Rana Ayyub, Barkha Dutt or Pramila

Your point about in-network facilities with out-of-network practitioners is a great one - if there‚Äôs one huge regulation I‚Äôd like to see in health care it would be abolishment of the whole ‚Äònetwork‚Äô concept.

It will be just like 2016 where the superdelegates vote for the candidate actually leading, and they‚Äôll of course happily vote for Joe before Sanders.  The BernieBros will complain about how ‚Äúundemocratic‚Äù it is just like they did last time when they selected Hillary despite the fact she had a plurality (and near majority of delegates).


It won‚Äôt be a real brokered convention if Joe is the front runner.  The only way this convention will descended into controversy is if Sanders has the plus reality but doesn‚Äôt have a majority."

3297,"You're hurting your own far worse than us or anyone else. But that's why you never have power and are content to be a spoiler, those short term cuts are the most you can achieve, if if they slice your own wrists"
3298,"On top of this, Biden is a truly nice person in the real sense. Our society needs a return to loving and caring for one another. Biden excels in this."
3299,"Biden was a U.S. Senator. It was literally his job to maintain a working relationship with people he disagreed with. Is Obama a racist for working with Robert Byrd?

Martin Luther King, Jr. was a great American and a true hero. Jesse Jackson has made progress in important areas but has also expressed bigotry and driven wedges between people. I laud Jesse Jackson for the achievements that he has made but fighting against bigotry is not an excuse for your own bigotry."
3300,"Don't bother arguing with them, the good about Joe is most of his voters don't do social media and so all these hashtags and viral posts won't make much difference."
3301,"Exactly. It would make Bernie look like a child grasping for whichever victory.

Biden should remain poised, confident and focused on shelling out solutions to solve the coronavirus crisis.

Let Bernie continue to ramble out his M4A and shit. Americans now prioritized the china virus's impact on them now rather than some stupid ass vague ultra-expensive policy like M4A and free college tuition that will never get passed in Congress."
3302,Bush rode that wave to reelection
3303,Wow down votes on a great video. I wonder who is doing that?
3304,"To be honest, trying to figure out who I support or which ideological box I neatly fit in would probably give you a headache. Ultimately, it‚Äôs not about me.

Edit: for clarity, I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm supporting Warren. I‚Äôm referring to the person in the screenshot."
3305,Edit: I misread your post. Nevermind
3306,"I think once the general election debates start, people will remember the #1 goal, no matter who they supported in the primaries."

3308,FL is a dead lock for trump
3309,That works.
3310,Any other surprise endorsements Biden can pull off before Michigan ???
3311,I don‚Äôt think it should be a requirement to know the specific ins and outs of guns to argue for gun control
3312,"Thanks, what does the Biden campaign need in terms of volunteering right now? I feel suddenly useless now that Warren is out üò¢"
3313,"I'm very confused right now. I am disabled, and right now am about to have my EBT cut off in April because of new Trump rules for SNAP. I know we need change badly."
3314,"I'm youngish and voted Biden. I don't post about it on social media, but there's a good amount of moderates around you don't see openly"

What.p a weird, vague mess of a comment."
3322,"Know your facts, she has been trying to tell her story since 1993."
3323,"I mean Biden clearly didn't blow the money he raised from his supporters. I know if I donate to him he'll deliver some more wins like he did in Michigan I guess.

I know Bernie hired his family, was he giving them the money? It's pretty sketch."
3324,Biden wins Bama... I can‚Äôt wait for the Bernie tears
3325,Biden on Jimmy Kimmel tonight!
3326,"Well he should go through his endorsements by speciality and prominence and feature then e.g. Harris, Klobuchar, Buttigieg,Booker and even see if Warren would be willing to talk about the policy idea of hers (bankruptcy plan?) Joe adopted"
3327,"&gt;The debate will probably give sanders a small uptick

Enough of an uptick for him to win any states or probably not?"
3328,"Honestly I'm pretty sure Biden supporters generally follow the ROTR just sort of incidentally. They're the only supporter group who never ridiculed Pete or trolled us or spread around bad information. It's one of several reasons I'm moving to Team Joe, but it's a big reason. Kindness counts."
3329,"My thoughts exactly. I lived in Philly during the last convention. I remember the Bernie people out in full force. I feel like that won't be as huge as it was last time, but things are so unpredictable. Anyway, I enthusiastically look forward to voting for Biden in June and November!"
3330,Everyone!
3331,[Beto also called out Biden](https://twitter.com/adamcbest/status/1234658810649698307) but  endorsed him yesterday. Primary season is a different beast

3334,GO VOTE. In 2016 Hillary voters thought it was over. No way to lose... Then she lost. Go vote.
3335,"What are you talking about?! What do they deserve? They‚Äôre voters, not kkk members. The fuck?"
3336,I spent about 90 minutes on the text team yesterday!  I'm awaiting more texting campaigns today.
3337,"Today will tell. On ST, Biden was the one who brought new/increased voters. But you *could* chalk some of that up to Bernie supporters getting too comfortable and thinking they had it in the bag.  
  
Today is the first competition where both sides are fully aware of the battle and what needs to happen. I honestly just hope that Biden's base does not take too much comfort in the recent polls and thinks they can stay home."

If I come around and say: ""banks in Iran are interest-free, we should do the same."" Would I be saying that Iran's HORRIFIC government is a good thing? I'm sorry but lessons can be learned anywhere you look. You may be right that context is important and things sometimes wouldn't work elsewhere, but thinking about whether they could is not a bad thing to do. We imported democracy from Athens, haven't we? Even if under a different, better frame.

That said, Bernie said over and over that he criticized authoritarianism and is fundamentally opposed to authoritarianism. If you think he's condoning it, you heard it wrong. If you're not prepared disagreement, then you might as well not discuss anything.

Why bring race into it though? All candidates are old white guys. If anything, the guy you're shitting on is Jewish, who have, historically, been a persecuted minority."

I only noticed on the third time I was watching, because my eyes were too blurry from my own crying during the first two views. 

It's been a good year following and supporting Pete, and I'm so proud of what he has done for the entire party by being a candidate. 

Pete brings people together. Pete brought me here. Joe has one more vote coming his way tomorrow once the postman stops by the house. 

#TeamPeteForever

#TeamBiden2020"
3354,"For starters, look at the supporters. Biden is a coalition builder. Today highlights that more than anything. There's a *reason* Beto, Pete, Amy, and others are throwing their weight behind Joe and not Bernie. 

Bernie is notorious for having an extremely divisive base. His ideas sound positive - even fantastic - in many cases. Who wouldn't support ensuring everyone has access to health care and education? 

But reality is cold and calculating. The difference isn't in the end goal, which is a better future for the United States. The difference is in the approach, and the practicality. 

Joe Biden will look you in the eyes and tell you that the path isn't easy. That it won't be accomplished overnight. That it is a never ending journey of continuous improvement. Bernie will look you in the eyes and tell you it'll all magically work out, just vote for him! Free health care! Free college! Debt gone!

But that's not how reality works. How would it be paid for? How would the transition be handled? How would he navigate Congress and a divided nation?

Joe Biden has demonstrably *proven* he can do so, and I say all this as someone who has him as his *fourth choice*. I have absolute and total confidence that after a term of Biden that the United States, and the world, will be in an infinitely better place than it would be under another four years of Trump, or four years of Sen. Sanders. 

So Bernie and his backers may promise you the world, but ask yourself not just whether they could deliver it, but how they would. Biden will ask you to confront inconvenient truths and realities. But he will not lie to you. 

Bear that in mind as you decide who to support."
3355,"&gt;Told to get in line?

Again, do you have evidence of this?"
3356,yeah that‚Äôs what I was going for
3357,"&gt; If you largely support Biden's policies, and you are too young to rent a car and you have never voted before but refuse to vote ~~for him because you've somehow convinced yourself he's identical to Trump,~~ then you are a progressive.

FTFY"

3363,Obama did the same.
3364,Agreed
3365,I was thinking more like Guam and Bikini Atoll. :)

3370,Right? It's nice to look at but I think it may look a little better for Sanders after Tuesday.
3371,"I agree.

Washington was also always a Sanders stronghold so just the fact of it being close, if it ends up that way, will be significant."
3372,"He bested both her and Warren in literally all four states they competed in, not just Iowa."

3375,538 is great at rating pollsters.  I trust Silver.
3376,"Bussing and carpooling, for a lot of people the hardest part is getting to polls in the first place.

After that, I'd say all we can do is make their wait comfortable. Set up stands, provide food and drinks. Shoot the shit, making voting an event as well as a duty.

Then we work on legislation for the long-term goal of not letting things like this happen. Much of which is handled at the state level, so make sure we get the right people into the state assemblies."

3379,"End of the day, Pete and Warren were *very* close together on 4-year policy. 

Warren frequently focused on the second iteration of some of her plans while Pete only acknowledged that there'd be more to do after phase 1.

Somehow that made Warren progressive and Pete moderate according to the media. Tone was the primary difference between them, both of them were pragmatic first and progressive second."

3384,"We are gracious, but we are also adults 

We learned positions, we voted on policies, character, track records, how our ideology aligns and what we want the future to be.

I feel like information is what is needed. If a democrat finds something appealing in Trump, I‚Äôd question their judgement or intent.

This isn‚Äôt a cult of personality, we need to be a fact based group of people aligned and marching towards a common goal.

3388,"The problem people have with Bernie's comments about Cuba is that he doesn't seem to acknowledge the problems, and instead only talks about them in a positive light."
3389,"It won't even be red for a few weeks.

3390,"I know he isn't the Biden in 08 and 12. But he killed VP debate both times, like crushed that debate. So he has the debating skill and experienced attack from a Republican challenger on a  national scale which no other candidate has."
3391,He'll be the most progressive elected president of our country and will be able to actually institute many of his plans.

3394,"Not only that, they‚Äôre just bad ideas. Medicare for All would throw nearly 2 million healthcare workers into unemployment. It would cut our GDP by around 10 points. We already have a doctor‚Äôs shortage, and doctor salaries are high in part because of insurance companies. How are we going to stabilize their salaries while inviting more students into studying medicine?

Sanders has virtually no plan to stabilize a forced recession and I‚Äôd really love to know how he plans to fix the problem his bill would create."
3395,"This makes sense; Biden is Putin's least favorite candidate. If you love America and want to see what remains of our democracy protected, Biden is the logical choice."
3396,I‚Äôm a republican. Sanders is just to far left.
3397,i didn‚Äôt want to make this a live discussion i‚Äôm sorry everyone
3398,"&gt;I hope there‚Äôs room for me on the malarkey bus.



This is just another misconception and slanderous lie coming out of the reddit and twittersphere from the Bernie Brothers.  Joe is actually AGAINST Malarkey of all shapes and forms. In fact, he wants to complete iradicate Malarkey from our entire country! I'm not surprised his actual stance on this hasn't made it through your echo chamber! 


*I swear I'm just kidding, welcome to the team and we need your's and every other vote to beat Trump. I'm not as excited for Joe as I was for another candidate, but I am excited about Democrats finally coming together to do the right thing. Welcome!*"
3399,"I wouldn't consider Joe's stutter to be a concern at all. While I don't know what it's like to have one, my understanding of how he copes with it is that if he can't get the word out that he wants, he'll switch to a similar word. While this may sound odd to someone who isn't used to hearing Joe speak, I've heard him enough now that, when I do notice it, I recognize that it's just his brain doing what he had to train it to do decades ago.

His stutter doesn't have anything to do with whether he is of sound mind."
3400,"A couple of things:

Al Gore won the popular vote in the country by half a million votes.  He did not win the electoral vote, and really everything came down to Florida.  

There, after the initial count and maybe a recount (edit: in Florida, which if it went to Gore would tip the election), Gore  was the loser by something like 500 votes out of 6 million cast.  Ralph Nader was the Green Party candidate; so left of the Dems.  Nader disputes this, but I think had he dropped out, Gore would have won at least 500 more votes.  

The close vote triggered a recount under Florida law.  There were some allegations of irregularity in the recount which ultimately landed at the Supreme Court in the now infamous Bush v. Gore case.  I do not remember the specifics of the case anymore, but the bottom line is that the court, divided 5-4 on partisan lines, halted the recount process, effectively ending any hope for Gore.

Was the election rigged? Not to say that I like it, but the electoral college did what it was designed to do, much as it did in 2016 when Clinton won the popular vote.  It gave weight to a bunch of a small states.  Though I don‚Äôt know that a further recount would have changed the outcome, the Supreme Court ended up looking pretty bad."
3401,Older voters are better at voting period. They‚Äôll mail it in if they have to. It‚Äôs usually the younger folks who give up when it gets tough
3402,"Sanders ad that is running in Florida is suggesting that Biden has been advocating for cuts in Social Security for 40 years. That's not true as a blanket statement and if Biden says on a debate stage that he talked about temporary freezes to increases to SS as way to reduce the deficit during floor debates in the 90's isn't fair to his overall record of voting to protect benefits but would surely be used against him to make it seem that what Sanders is saying is true.

I just watched a Sanders advisor say that the reason for bringing that up is to show Americans the importance of consistency. So are we supposed to just ignore Bernie's voting record on gun control? People's opinions change and the reasons why they were one way or the other can be very complicated depending on the time and situation.

I was a very conservative Republican for about the first couple decades of my life, raised in a very conservative household. That changed in the early 2000's. I was also a Bernie voter in 2016. That changed as well. So to me consistency isn't as important as being able to understand that to get anything done in politics means being able to make some concessions on your agenda and reach across the aisle to actually get things done."
3403,y tho
3404,yang is a visionary
3405,"I have no problem with it. Joe, Pete and now Amy supporters are all on the same team."
3406,"Oh, ouch. So you are suggesting they're not qualified.  Wow. That's pretty disappointing. Hopefully the majority of voters can see that black women can be smart, ambitious, effective leaders."
3407,Biden is on track to outperform Hillary's performance against Trump by almost the same margins that he's outperforming Hillary's performance against Bernie. Trump should be scared.
3408,The rigging was the super delegates. Obama is free to do what he wants. If he wants to tweet his endorsement then so be it.
3409,Why doesn't Joe have a No Malarkey t-shirt &gt;:(
3410,Sexism will never be a bigger obstacle than racism.
3411," Russian bots were helping his campaign, but he didn't have any ties to Russia."
3412,"Yeah I'm here. If we have a Democrat majority everywhere, Biden wont veto progressive legislation that passes."
3413,"hi mods, congratulations on the the low karma flair and moderator approval shit. biden, if he is the nom, is going to lose explosively to trump. he's about as capable of withstanding examination as this sub"
3414,"&gt;Good list. But I don‚Äôt know about the second one.  
&gt;  
&gt;Moving to extremes to boost turnout has failed for Sanders, and Biden should not seek to replicate that failure by moving left after he‚Äôs all but won the primary.

With Point 2, what I meant was continue to do what he did in his Fairly Important Tuesday address, welcome/court them while addressing the rest of the voters.

No need for him to move further to the left.  His current platform is even more progressive than what existed under the Obama administration!"

3422,"Amy is what good representation looks like. She is able to reach across the aisle, and get stuff done for her constituents. A perfect balance of urban and rural interests, the Minnesota DFL and Amy are models for Democrats across the country. üíö"
3423,"So, I will be voting for Biden in the General election. I was an Elizabeth Warren supporter but sadly she is no longer in the race. I will be voting Biden because unlike Bernie, I think that Biden can get some stuff done in office. I hope you guys are okay with that."
3424,"That was January.  Felon-rights groups appealed and won.

Ron DeSantis and the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta upheld a lower court decision that found the state could not deny ex-felons the right to vote just because they can‚Äôt afford to pay outstanding court fines, fees and restitution, as required by the 2019 law."
3425,"The VP role is usually defined by the president. It can either be active and high visibility, or wallowing in obscurity. I have a feeling that whoever is VP in Biden's administration, it will be more the former than the latter."
3426,Awesome! It's big news that Biden is obtaining Bernie supporters before Super Tuesday.
3427,"I'm actually really excited about his plan for post-secondary education - it's so in depth and multi-layered, you can tell a lot of research went into it to make sure it was as comprehensive as possible while also being feasible. They also link to a lot of the studies they use to justify their plan. I really do think community college is a really valuable path for those who may otherwise struggle to pay for college, and the investment into that I think is a major step towards expanding education for the future

It's honestly really enthrilling to see such comprehensive, thought-out plans. Most of the other candidates had talked vaguely about their plans or the reasons why they work, for Biden's plan you can actually follow along with every part of every policy and that level of intricacy to me shows actual care in ensuring the best for the American people"
3428,"Just some quick thoughts about coronavirus, its a perfect example how out off touch the tea party-type republicans are, how far removed from reality libertarian ideology can be.

I dont believe the government should be in charge of everything (though im a Bernie-supporter, hah), but this ""run government like a business"" is so dumb in the real world.
Private business cant foot the bill thats coming in the Next few months, they cant survive not having profits, paying people sick leave for extended periods of time, the government, however, can do that.

The government should have a responsibility to make sure people get by in bad times, if government was run like a business, we'd all be fucked now."

3432,"Honestly, there's an argument to be made for Harris, Booker, or Whitmer as VP."
3433,"Bernies supporters are mainly young people, joe bidens supporters are mainly older people, thats why the bernie support seems much stronger on places like twitter and reddit since they are mainly the younger crowd."
3434,Biden is not an evil. His policies will save lives.
3435,"Ohio primary is being delayed until June 2nd.

It's happening. Bernie stays as a spoiler if other states follow suit."
3436,We ridin‚Äô! üèç
3437,"I‚Äôm a pragmatist and I just don‚Äôt see Sanders as being a viable president. 

None of his policies could be implemented in our current political climate.

Edit: Biden is the person we need to bring our country back together. I don‚Äôt want a revolution, I want everyone to stop yelling all the time."
3438,"I love seeing the black community out for Biden.  We are here because they saved and bolstered this campaign.

It's a shame Bernie bros actually smear this community as ""establishment"" and ""low information.""  It's like the looked at how Clinton lost the general election, and decided to adopt that for the primary.

I also love that Biden turns around always to talk to the people behind him.  He knows how to treat the people who have his back well."
3439,We need to protect him from the Bernie bros
3440,"I am not here to be convinced to like joe, I am here to get his supporters perspective.  Your probably right, your not going to make me change my mind, however you could at least let me know what it is about him that you support.

What the belief system was like with people wanting this guy to serve as our commander in chief,...  I don‚Äôt see how any one could like this guy and I feel like it‚Äôs all based on lies.  I think the results are fake.  I can‚Äôt figure out why people would want him as our president.  I‚Äôm confused?

Could you help me understand?

I was born in 88 so I never got to see the first time he ran for office.  But when I see things like this,...

https://youtu.be/lSUPfnYdXFU 

I see that he literally has been lying since the day I was born and it worries me.  Please don‚Äôt take this personal, I am not trying to offend you on your choices.  We are able to view each other with differences in opinion without judging each other or labeling.  I am not opposed to the Democratic Party, I am opposed to corruption.  I am a nurse, so I have a tendency to protect people."
3441,"Haha sorry. Figured I'd have sone fun. I actually posted it and thought ""watch this get reported by someone who only read the title."""
3442,"I would like to give Bennie that credit, but I feel that if that were his end goal intentions he would do like everyone else and actually endorse and maybe even campaign with him get us on the same team sooner. I would have never wanted Joe in the end but I knew I would pick him over Bernie. Watching my top choice get out and endorse Joe only made that easier."
3443,"How we can beat Trump:

We have a higher favorability than Trump

We have the almighty power of BloomBux

The right wing media hasn‚Äôt been smearing Joe for the past 20 years like they did Hillary 

We were able to win Super Tuesday with less money and an inferior organization than other candidates 

The 41 house seats flipped by democrats in 2018 were all of the center left wing of the party, they were like buttigieg and Biden, not Warren or Sanders

Biden has much more support from black voters then Biden ever did

Biden projects an aura of decency and dignity in contrast to trump

Biden has consistently beat trump in polls, usually with larger margins than Sanders."
3444,What do you mean?
3445,Gd you! Such a beautiful song. Take my upvote and get out of here...
3446,What about convincing the remaining on-the-fence Warren supporters?
3447,"So this topic is a bit complex. Sweden, Norway and Denmark make up Scandinavia. In cultural terms, you can probably include Iceland and Finland but it would be more accurate to talk about the Nordic countries if you are talking about all of them. Finland is the least Scandinavian culturally, due to many reasons like language and larger eastern influence. Still pretty similar to Sweden though, compared to lets say, Italy.

Estonia is kinda Finland's little brother, but that is of course an exaggeration. Very similar language and Finnish people travel there a lot. Estonia is still very different from the Nordic Countries (Finland included), because of their past in the Soviet Union. The 20th century took Estonia in a very different direction and the country has been finding itself again after the Soviet Union collapsed. It is a completely different place than it was in just 2006 or 2010. Nowadays Estonians have a capitalist mindset but that definitely was not the case when I traveled there as a child. And I don't mean that capitalism was not popular, I mean the people were bad at it. It is hard to say what Estonia will look like in 20 years but if I had to guess I would say they won't build the same type of Nordic welfare state that the Nordic Countries built. If the Nordic Countries are social democracies, then Estonia is politically a Neoliberal nation, which just shows the magnitude of change in the country. Just 3 decades ago they were under a communist economic system."
3448,"Yeah, I'm mostly just glad that I made up my mind finally lol. My go to joke this cycle has been this primary is about me coming to terms with voting for Joe and it looks like that's coming true. Especially since he's always been high on my list while I've cycled through Klobuchar, Harris, O'Rourke, Warren, and Buttigieg."
3449,Pete definitely needs to go full time with the beard
3450,"Just remember that Bernie's supporters have an outsized voice on Reddit than they do in everyday society. For god sake, r/politics is like a front for the Bernie campaign at this point. Cenk Uygur finished third in a primary for a Congressional Seat. Enough said."
3451,Just went over to JoeBiden.com and signed up.  I had been on team Pete but ready to join team Biden.   Real human compassion and great leader.
3452,"Couldn‚Äôt login to the training, just said that the host had another meeting going. Will try again next week."
3453,"Here from Team Pete! It's still raw and fresh, but I'm thrilled to see Pete getting right to it and teaming up with the VP ‚ù§"
3454,"To me morality is about actually dong things that help people, not just saying you‚Äôre morally pure because you won‚Äôt support anything that isn‚Äôt pure enough even if it‚Äôs better than the alternative."
3455,I like the second part of your comment better than the first part
3456,No worries! I‚Äôm just asking now because although I‚Äôm a Bernie supporter and haven‚Äôt given up he‚Äôs looking like the probable candidate so I just want to view him through your lens a bit.
3457,Florida!
3458,Why?
3459,"He did great! And you‚Äôre right, slowing down and some deep breathing would help him."
3460,"The UK has Queen Elizabeth, we have RBG.  üëë"
3461,"Of course he should, and will. I just think Bernie won't accept, because he's not a Democrat and doesn't do anything to progress his vision."
3462,Even AOC ditched Bernie and his campaign because of his toxic supporters.
3463,"76% reporting in CA, and Bernie's gap with Biden is shrinking from 10 to 8.9 points now"
3464,Thank you!
3465,*My president.*
3466,Biden will restore balance to the Force...of America!
3467,"Big fan of Warren, but I think we need her seat in the Senate and she can be a very effective fighter for progressive causes there. She would also be a very polarizing pick for moderates and independents who we will need to court for the general (and I think a lot of the Bernie progressive crowd hate her too for dumb reasons so picking her might not move the needle much with them)"
3468,"&gt;We fight for staple progress

I'm glad we're not on the wrong side of the office supplies anymore"
3469,"Ask not what Bloomberg can do for our Biden, ask what **you** can do for our Biden."
3470,She does not support torture
3471,No it‚Äôs Joe!
3472,I think there‚Äôs a small chance. I think the dems are getting a little too sure of themselves. We can‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a likely win because it‚Äôs not. It can happen but it‚Äôll be hard.
3473,This time next year she might be up to 8 percent.
3474,"Trump is still favoured to win, I'm not sure why people are so upbeat about this."
3475,I can believe that but can you post a link to one of their tweets?
3476,Yeah I‚Äôm disappointed in AOC. If she wants to point at one person then she has to do the same for the Sanders side.
3477,"So this is kind of crazy and not about Joe...but you may want to check out the Peace Corps. Many people with public loans can get them entirely forgiven or partially cancelled, and they are often deferred when you are in the service. It's sort of a case by case basis. HOWEVER, some private loan companies will ""honor"" (lol at them having honor, but can't think of another word) the Peace Corps and offer some sort of forgiveness/partial cancellation deal. You have to directly contact your loan provider if it's private, and not only rely on the Peace Corps, to see if they agree or have some sort of deal.  I know all of this because a close friend just went through it with his application."
3478,"Lets see how that holds up after the bodies add up in a week or two.

Im sorry if thats dark but... I am extrapolating from the numbers here..."

3480,Welcome. Former bloom supporter here.
3481,Grinned ear-to-ear at the picture of a four year old joyfully watching CSPAN. ü•∞
3482,Go fuck your self. That‚Äôs why I won‚Äôt vote for Biden. People like you shitting on others for no reason.
3483,"Let tomorrow happen first. Haha.

Given Super Tuesday's results, youth voters may be more inspired to come out and vote for Bernie. But likewise, the more pragmatic voters would also be more inspired to follow Super Tuesday's results to vote Biden and deny Bernie the lead.

So these polls can go either way."
3484,"I agree. Biden needs to call yang, endorse UBI, and have Yang be his VP. He would win by a landslide. Bernie wouldn't be able to beat Joe and neither would Trump."
3485,"Good point. I feel like her age is the biggest problem, though. Warren is older, and looks  younger, and Demings is about the same age and looks 15 years younger."
3486,Oooh I'd love to see Yang as Mayor of NYC. I hope he does.
3487,"Well he's going about it the wrong way.  He built a campaign staffed by people who only excel at lobbing insults and slander, he spent 2016 attacking the Democratic party itself, and even though he had lost and Clinton was running a quite progressive platform at the time he insisted on continuing to run and attacking her.

He's doing the same thing now, he's lost badly and yet he continues to sling mud at people who should be his allies. His supporters claim he never does it but man he really doesn't mind when his campaign staff and top surrogates do it for him.

I'm very progressive, but there is absolutely no chance I would ever support Sanders. He's an absolutely awful advocate for progressive ideas, and I think in the long run he's going to do more to harm the progressive movement than help it.  Unfortunately a sizeable segment of his supporters just can't see that and view him as some political messiah and not as the ineffective politician he's been for years."
3488,"All very good points.

Also you're the first person with that flair I've seen so far, welcome!"
3489,"""I wish my name was Hunter Biden. I could go abroad and make millions off my father's presidency. I'd be a really rich guy""

- an actual quote by Donald Trump Jr. (worth noting Biden has never been president to this point, so yeah definitely projecting haha)

‚ÄúI do not know what he learned while growing up as a Biden, but if what we know about his life indicates anything, it is that there are different rules if you are the son of a powerful Democratic politician. Money grows on trees, there are no rules, and the press will always cover for you if it benefits the political left.‚Äù

- An actual quote by Eric Trump (change Biden to Trump and Democratic to Republican and you can‚Äôt help but laugh at them) 

I hope Bloomberg spends the $300 million he has left in his war chest (I think that is the number, don‚Äôt quote me) digging up every bit of dirt on the Trumps he can and that they spend the rest of their lives as miserable as they made decent Americans under four years of this commander and thief."
3490,"And that's the ""presto socialism"" part I really don't understand. They think that people are going to all agree the answer to ""shits fucked"" is socialism, but why in the world would they think the general population would think that?"
3491,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20X2yYVEGII&amp;feature=emb_title
3492,"I voted for Bernie in my primary but I am firmly for Biden now and I‚Äôm not seeing any anti-Bernie sentiment here? I even wrote a quasi mea culpa last night here outlining why I voted for Bernie in Florida‚Äôs primary and I was very welcomed here. I think a lot of people here take issue with Bernie‚Äôs zealots that are willing to drag the entirety of supporters who went for *any* other former candidate down simply because ‚ÄúHow could you possibly not be for Bernie?!?‚Äù 

The disgust with that particular sect of his followers could be misconstrued as ‚Äúanti-Bernie sentiment‚Äù, but there has been plenty of informative civil discourse here with many others who supported former candidates."
3493,I love how for most of the opponents that have dropped out and those that have endorsed him Joe wrote a statement that's entirely about them and what they've accomplished.
3494,"Hey, Magoo.  Good to see you here.  Yes, thank you, this not only makes this space feel more familiar, it makes me feel we refugees from Team Pete have brought, and you have accepted, something of value to our new country.  To our successful collaboration!"
3495,"""We need to stop attacking each other *like Bernie is*.""

Yeah, no sense of irony there."
3496,"And then saying ""why would the DNC do this"" when the rest of the party's voters unite around someone else."
3497,"Unless a credible media outlet finds something, I think this sub should not waste oxygen on a story that only exists in the red rose  and maga twitterspheres"
3498,It WAS!
3499,"&gt; Biden's base will become complacent 

True..



Honestly, I see this as more of an anti Trump vote electorate that are more fired up to vote against Trump then they are for voting for Biden. 



and I'm ok with that. As long as it draws those people our and gets them to the polls."
3500,I‚Äôll be in the Columbus area knocking!
3501,"As a Pete supporter, it isn't really in the spirit of the ROTR.

However, after literal months of both Pete and Joe being called ""Repulicans"" just because they didn't outright support MFA or their classic rebuke to the toxic nature of the campaign being ""you want people to DIE over someone being mean to you on Twitter?!?!"", not to mention just their neverending blatant misuse of the truth, has really really frustrated me. And that part of me makes me very happy that there ""movement"" seems to be contained to the confines of Twitter. I'm all for progressive ideals (Biden would be the most progressive president yet) but not for the way Bernie and his surrogates want to get it done. There's much healthier ways to get change done than to alienate both parties on the spectrum."
3502,Sorry; didn't see this was a quote from January.
3503,"Joe biden literally asked Bernie if it was okay to name them, Bernie said go ahead and then Joe backed off. I dont see how accepting an offer Joe made and then immediately back pedaled on is stirring a pot that Joe biden literally cooked for himself."
3504,"i have no grudge with Pete.   what do I care?  

My point is simple, Joe Biden will get crucified if he picks any man. It must be a women."
3505,We need to spread things like this to counteract the insane propaganda machine against him
3506,"Has, not will, Joe."
3507,I can‚Äôt wait to see him for Sec of state or higher position.
3508,This is pulling too many of my heart strings.
3509,"Just saw on the local news that people are lining up outside of gun shops because ‚Äúif things get worse, people are going to be looting and I need to protect myself‚Äù."
3510,If you get a chance watch the RBG documentary from 2018. She‚Äôs unbelievable.
3511,"The polls also tout his youth support, but polls don't equal votes"
3512,It‚Äôs just reddit and twitter. Look at the results. He‚Äôs winning
3513,"We don't want to give them more reason to hate us. Even if they say the most spiteful thing to you, be the bigger person.

You know the saying: don't argue with ignorance because they will bring you down to their level and beat you by experience?

Well, I've spoken to a lot of my friends who are Bernie supporters/Bros: they're rallying based on emotion and sentiment, so don't fight their emotion with your emotion because they will beat you with their experience."
3514,"Yeah, I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd respond. Sad to see I was right."
3515,"Two reasons: first, we put up the best candidates in the general elections.  They aren't the candidates that I would choose to put up--right now I'm losing to a majority (of Dems) that disagree with me--but they are the best candidates.

Second, I know we'll have our day, and I know that the more work I put in now, the sooner that day will come."
3516,"The rest of the media had let Clinton's chances remain at 99% due to their own biases. It was very clear that Trump had a decent chance at winning from mid-September. The Comey letter was simply what gave him the edge he needed.

The fact that politicians and pundits still can't figure out how he won, and why they were wrong, is indicative of how much of a bubble they live in."
3517,"I think you're right that those states probably won't swing blue, but at the same time I think Republicans in swing states identify with the Republicans in deep red states. I think there might be a nationwide backlash amongst Republicans if significant tragedy hits those states."
3518,Don't let these losers get you down bro.
3519,"I would love Amy. But sounds like her star is fizzling. 

Warren would be amazing. But I'd be surprised if it's not Kamala."
3520,I love Bennet.  I heard he might run for Senate ü§ûü§ûü§û
3521,Twitter is an absolute cesspool
3522,I think ratios are less important than turnout in this case. Democrats tend to lose turnout among minorities rather than defections to republicans.
3523,"Yup, makes sense. Did some of the news networks jump the gun early by declaring Sanders as the eventual winner? 

Nate hasn't updated the 538 primary forecast because of this reason."
3524,"Off the top of my head, vulnerable Senate Republicans: Collins, McSally, Tills, Daines if Bullock enters...Gardner's? Am I forgetting anyone?"
3525,It appears I have been gaslighted...
3526,Hows moscow
3527,"He is really is a brilliant man. I always wanted to hate him because it seemed to me like he was unfair to Beto, but I have really learned so much from his twitter threads that I can't even dislike him."
3528,Michiganders hate malarkey. This is basically Bernie's nightmare scenario.
3529,The moment he drops out the healing can begin but until that point he‚Äôs still subjecting all of these voters to corona and aiding trumps reelection campaign.
3530,Mayor Pete
3531,It will count
3532,Also former Yang Gang. I picked Biden over Bernie due to the fact he actually has concern over the 4th industrial revolution.
3533,"Eh, recent state-wide polls have me worried though!"
3534,"Stacey Abrams is awesome but she has no federal experience.  Biden needs someone who can take over the whole presidency from day one if something happens to him, and I don't think Abrams is ready for that yet.  I think she's going to have a great career in the Democratic party though.  

Kamala, Duckworth, and Warren are the people who best fit the bill for the needed experience.  I think Warren's expertise with stopping financial crisis and creating federal agencies puts her at the top of the list for qualified VP's right now."
3535,I‚Äôm still banned about 8 months later. r/neoliberal is my home now
3536,I used to be anti Hillary until I learned about her as Secretary of State. She has done great work and service for our country and democracy.
3537,Too many people I know hear free college and immediately go to Bernie. It‚Äôs just upsetting because that‚Äôs the only thing they‚Äôre going on and there‚Äôs like no chance that gets passed in my opinion.
3538,"Oh, I rather like ""Diamond Joe""."
3539,Who also has the experience to repair our foreign policy and to handle a national crisis like the one we're currently going through.
3540,I second that motion.
3541,Is this true? I honestly didn't expect her to drop out.
3542,"Well, let‚Äôs hope they actually do! I won‚Äôt discourage anyone from voting, but I‚Äôll definitely discourage anyone from voting for Bernie! Have a good one! Vote for who you want!"
3543,"He did say Bernie had 9 super PACs, and provided no details post debate."
3544,"You didn't read the article. And here is Laurence Tribe verifying the claim:

https://twitter.com/tribelaw/status/1239955819371859970"
3545,You‚Äôre underselling how scared Trump is of Biden. He literally got impeached for his efforts to try and bring down Diamond Joe.
3546,"I‚Äôm the opposite of Bernie or Bust lol 

I voted for Biden in the primary &amp; will more than likely vote for him in the general (pending Biden‚Äôs VP pick). If Sanders were to somehow pull ahead &amp; get the dem nomination, hate to say this but I‚Äôd prefer 4 more years of Trump over Sanders. 

Know if Biden picks Sanders or Warren for VP, I‚Äôll be out."
3547,Do what you want I'm just asking that we don't give any reason they can use to justify their vitriol.
3548,Why is Warren in TX? Nobody's in SC and they wonder why they can't get the black vote. I swear. Ignoring the African American community isn't the way 2 do it!
3549,Seconded.
3550,"Voter turnout is *up* this time compared to last time. But sure yeah whatever. Believe what you want, man, I'm not gonna stop you."
3551,"This is a really good idea from Joe, but I am a student who is taking part time college because I don't have enough money for full time. 

I didn't take out loans to go to college and am going to local college, not because I don't have the grades to be recruited to bigger colleges. I have even been offered scholarship to attend other colleges. But because I don't have the money to see myself all the way through if I went to an instate higher ranked college.

Does this mean Joe will help me by giving me 10k towards being able to go to full time college for at least a year?"
3552,"I am always really doubtful that you can change trends. White men with out college education are becoming more republican, college educated suburban women are becoming more democratic.  

I don‚Äôt think we should expect the trend to suddenly change and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it worsens. Everyone has already conceded Iowa, Ohio and Indiana(went blue in 08) what makes Wisconsin different? 

We should build on the success of ‚Äò18 and win through North Carolina and Arizona. 

We should, off course, try both. But when I‚Äôm in a pessimistic mood, I look at Wisconsin, think about all the working class white men through out Europe who abandoned the left for the populist right (think the latest UK elections) and feel hopeless. This is a trend we can‚Äôt stop. And in 2024 we should forget about winning any semi rural state (Michigan, Minnesota, Maine, New Hampshire). Flipping Georgia and Texas isn‚Äôt just exciting, the future of the party fully depends on it. IMHO that is."

3556,"Warren voters are the higher educated progressive base. They won‚Äôt go to Bernie. I am very plugged into the Warren supporter base across the country and out of the hundreds of Warren voters I know, I only know one that would consider voting Bernie as a second choice. Everyone else had Pete and now Biden as their second choice. Bernie relies on young and uniformed progressives and then stray former Trump supporters."
3557,"It's clear he wouldn't.  He's picked up most of Pete's, half of Warren's, and nearly all of both Klobuchar and Bloomberg voters."
3558,I don‚Äôt think Michelle would want to.
3559,"center-left neoliberal, I am fiscally conservative, socially liberal. 

I never consider myself as progressive probably because nowadays that label is heavily associated with populism.

 I still like the idea of less government intervention, market based solution, pro immigration, pro free trade like TPP/NAFTA, incrementalist approach to everything,  I don't like populism whether it is coming from the right or the left. 

Biden is about in the same political spectrum as I do, that's why I supported him from day one."

Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them."
3569,I just ran this by someone who worries about this kind of thing for a living. Thanks for your input !
3570,What a load of bs to avoid answering the point. The thread states that it doesn‚Äôt matter that Biden was racist for so long because he stood behind Obama for 8 years. Now you‚Äôre telling me it doesn‚Äôt matter Bernie was the only elected white guy to stand behind a black guy in 1984 and 88 because jackson didn‚Äôt win. Oh but jesse jackson said hymietown. Did you see half the shit Biden himself said and did ( not a guy that Biden supported). Biden bragged in the 90‚Äôs that his bill would make everything a capital punishment except for jaywalking.
3571,Obama want campaigning at the time

Biden flipped Pacific, Skagit, and Chelan Counties. 

There's a chance Biden might flip Grant and Adams Counties. The vote margin in Grant County is 9 votes and in Adams County it's 4 votes."

3582,"&gt;Last time the economy collapsed it was because firms tried to raise the market far too aggressively (Subprime mortgages, remember?)

No, it was because firms overvalued assets because they underestimated the risk associated with that asset. Expectations of the future exceeded reality. This and the effects of it were exacerbated by other contributing factors.

&gt;The problem is when the same aggressive policies that raised the economy help accelerate it go down.

I feel like you people are just throwing together words you don't understand and think you are making an intelligent point, when everything you write is just gibberish. ""Raise the market aggressively""? ""Pushing the market to be more successful""? ""aggressive policies that raised the economy help accelerate it go down?"" Just nonsense through and through.

This recession is very, very different from the last one. It was an actual exogenous economic event (a virus) that made assets in the economy much lower value than they actually were, as profits were projected to drop severely due to the implications of the virus and containment measures. The last recession was an underestimation of risk of financial assets

3587,"Not that I have seen. Increasing the 1k distribution to 10k would benefit the person with 30k in loans making 50k and the person making 50k that just paid off 30k in loans equally. It's not perfect, but seems the most fair and efficient. Maybe it could be coupled with offering loan pay downs at a discount like done with medical bills (give us 5k, we'll take off 10k)."

One thing I'll never forget from listening to interviews with Fidel Castro is how earnestly he spoke about having to limit the free press to protect the gains of his revolution. It wasn't that he said it or that he did it so much as that he made me believe that he believed it -- he made me believe that, in his mind, he was doing the unfortunate but correct, just, and necessary thing. It was disturbing."
3592,"Without giving up too much about myself; I‚Äôm from the one of the heavily populated WOW counties that nearly always vote republican.


A lot of the Republicans here are old school Goldwater types and hate Trump.  Biden will not carry the WOW counties; but he may be able to take 40-45%.  Which is enough to flip the state.

3596,"um, the vote totals have clearly shown Biden is the front-runner. Which of these more educated states upcoming is Sanders winning in?  I'd like to see some of your data, because the polling data I see shows Biden leading by double digits in Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, and Connecticut.  Do you have other data to support your claim?  Or, are there more educated states I'm missing?"
3597,"I don't dislike her as a political figure. I dislike her as a person because her attitude was overbearing, at least this was the sentiment that most people(here on reddit) had during the 2016 primaries. You only have to go check the r/politics threads during early 2016.

It is undeniable that electing her as President would have been the better option(and with this 2019-ncov outbreak, it could have even saved lives), but it's not me who has to be convinced about this, ut's you guys in the US. I am just a foreigner watching your politics from a distance.

To adress the point about her being malicious, you only have to look at the republican **and** democratic media. In my very first comment, I said that she didn't have a very strong campaign and this is still true. She was so sure of winning against a dumbass businessman that she didn't really put in the effort, nor the DNC for that matter. The media built this malicious persona for her that caught on really well, **much, much better** than it would have for past candidates. I was not aware of her charity work and contributions, I would have assumed it was Bill's doing. Thank you for bringing it up.

I guess you can say that you've even changed my mind a about her but the fact is that Biden needs the support of Bernie's voters, otherwise without a united DNC, this will just be a repeat of 2016, narrowingly missing the election in some swing states."
3598,"I knew a Bernie supporter from 2016 who was out on the streets after the November vote protesting Trump, he probably had a #NotMyPresident sign and everything.

He didn't bother actually voting for Hillary Clinton though because he was too busy playing video games. He lived in Wisconsin."
3599,"You will find people who are headstrong on their political opinions regardless of who they are for. It's under every candidate. Maybe moreso for Bernie because there is a massive amount of support for him in the younger generation and thus online. So of course you see more of it.

Politics can suck. It's unfortunate but you will get into fights with others and lose friendships because of different views."
3600,"I think Coronavirus can create the perfect argument for full Medicare for All. We are only as healthy as our weakest links.

It also makes the perfect case against full Medicare For All. Look how incompetent they government has been administering a single test.  Would you really trust a future President like Trump to implement the whole healthcare industry? Would future presidents hide information or limit care to targeted demographics? 

I panic shopped at Costco this week, dropping hundreds I hadn‚Äôt planned on spending. I think companies like Costco should continue to provide quality healthcare to their employees, because they can afford it. We should make WalMart and similar companies provide better healthcare and let those in need sign up for Medicare.

I‚Äôm glad there are private companies working on testing and a vaccine. I honestly don‚Äôt trust the government to even tell me the truth right now and I‚Äôm concerned they are purposely withholding tests for political reasons. Expand Medicare, don‚Äôt ban private healthcare."

Presidential endorsements are just too important."

Not only are Uighars, Tibetans and others oppressed and don't enjoy that standard of living, but even for Chinese workers the working conditions are terrible, some so bad that the workers commit suicide.  Sanders' has such a bad, surface level understanding of so many things that it's surprising he got this far in two presidential elections."
3609,That would do it. Kamala has got recognition. Tough call.
3610,"Bernie's climate plan ensures that all electricity and transportation will be produced renewable by 2030, and it ensures the creation of jobs to replace those lost through the removal of old jobs. And no, I'm not saying some people  won't have to pay, everybody will pay, but in a public option there's not nearly enough revenue to cover expensive healthcare if people are allowed to opt out. And yes, the African-American, suburban and people over 50 (I'm pretty sure exit polling shows Bernie edges out in the 40-50 demographic too) votes matter, but it's about changing the direction of the party, and if we're not capable of bringing progressive ideas to the campaign then why should anybody who is a progressive vote? You have to have somebody who reflects the interests of the whole party, not just the majority, or else you won't win in the general, and it's time that progressives stop compromising and demand that their views be represented too."

3629,"Yeah, but I really like the situation room optics of Biden sitting at the head of the table, flanked by experts, as he leans back and listens to them walk through what‚Äôs happening.

Biden got second in California, and while that's good he got it through people who already knew his policy from their own research or from basic name recognition. I was quite anti-bloomberg, yet I could tell you his policy and a lot of his campaign messaging. 

It wasn't until this week that I was able to get an actual full grasp on Biden's policies. OP may say it doesn't even matter, but with $4,000 spent in California all you're left with is with a lot of Californians who either don't know or don't agree with what they've heard from Biden about his policies. And aside from the debate stage, those voters have only heard about Biden from outside sources, and you'll need to reach them once the general happens."
3632,link please to this twitter that will be releasing them
3633,"I really don‚Äôt believe that things are more negative on the Bernie side than any other. The only thing I can see is people believing that medical care is a human right and that the climate crisis is a huge problem that is way past due for people to be working on and any candidate that is going to place profits of corporations over what is morally required of us needs to have their motives questioned. For people that believe in the human right argument it is pretty egregious to hear that the current system where we pay more per capita and have worse health outcomes for it is ok and we should continue it. To question the past political stances and comments of a candidate is also not toxic, it is required of an electorate. And yes, people should be digging up every vote and comment of EVERY candidate and judging them by it, because if a candidate fell on the wrong side of an issue multiple times they will do it again no matter what they promise and if a candidate falls on the wrong side of many things the first time they cannot be trusted to make the right decision when a new issue comes up. Calling people out for their past behavior is not toxic, neither is holding those examples up for that persons supporters to confront. As far as Sirota, when I see his Twitter feed it‚Äôs usually him posting direct quotes or video, so not sure why that‚Äôs a bad thing."
3634,"Wow ! Bernie even has a plan to eradicate the senate ? Colour me surprised ... 

I'm kidding of course but let's not get to Trumpkin levels of conspiracy theory here !

I think it is plausible that Joe surpasses 80% and Bernie doesn‚Äôt even reach viability. I am dead serious. 73-27 would be in the better range of outcomes for Bernie. There is no state imaginable worse for him demographically."

3649,"I was a huge Pete supporter and his withdrawal really hurts because I still believe no one was better for the moment than him. Today I‚Äôm voting Joe because he‚Äôs the only one who seems to be championing Pete‚Äôs message of belonging which I believe is vital in the age of Trump. Joe is also the only one left with a good handle on foreign policy which was one of the things that drew me to Pete and is more of what a president does than setting a legislative agenda is. Finally, another critically important thing a president does is building an executive team. The people Bernie has chosen for leadership positions in his campaign disgust me (Turner, Sirota, Joy) with the way they have treated Pete and others who don‚Äôt fall in line. On the other hand with Joe, he has committed that Pete will play an important role in his administration which deals the deal for me. I still believe we need Pete more than ever and now the best way to get that is with Joe."
3650," Why we need Joe is obvious. Imagine waking up one morning and going about your daily business‚Äìyou have had breakfast and are about to leave for work, but you can‚Äôt remember where you left your keys. Common enough you say; we have all done that at some time or other. Your wife hands you your keys and off you go. Life carries on as normal for a few weeks then one day, while at work you have to call a colleague, but you have inexplicably forgotten his extension number; an extension number you have called numerous times a day for the past 10 years. You feel silly but put it down to being tired. You work hard and hold a high profile position in a financial institution so it is understandable that you will have memory lapses now and again. Like the key incident, you laugh it off."

Once everyone gets on the same page it's going to be time to steam roll that train wreck in DC, I mean Mara Lago actually."
3653,"It's the exact same for me, by the way (even to the point of Klobuchar being my favorite candidate).

I'll also add that if the polling and delegate situation were reversed with Bernie having &gt;99% in the model and uniform double-digit polling leads, and I lived in one of today's states instead of a ST state, I would (grudgingly) vote for Bernie for the sake of party unity.  

A contested convention is the actual worst possible outcome IMO."

3656,"Disagreeing doesn't change facts.

&gt;  The majority wants it

And Democrats have been fighting for it since HillaryCare in the 1990s. Biden proposed a Public Option in 2008, and still wants to implement it today. This will give all uninsured Americans healthcare, in a style similar to most other developed countries.

If you actually care about giving everyone health insurance, which is what universal healthcare means, then you should vote for Biden.

If you want Bernie's M4A style single payer healthcare, then know that it is easier to go from Public Option to single payer, than it is to go from nothing under Trump to anything.

Step out of the bubble of purity politics and accelerationism, and you will see true progressives have only one option in November."

But we aren't quite there yet, and most Sanders supporters have invested a lot of emotional capital into his primary."

3664,Reagan won by 18.2% in 1984.
3665,"As a Bernie voter who is considering not voting in November if Biden is the nominee I appreciate this. 

I think it really washes over his weaknesses. The bankruptcy bill is a huge red flag. I work with consumer protection agencies and actually it's really hurting middle class families. It's not good at all. There is nothing good about that bill. I say that not as a partisan (I usually am) i say that from my work experience which is nonpartisan. 

I will sit down and examine Biden a second time. I have not decided what I will do but for moderates, i will say this. If Biden wants to beat trump in 2020 (I think I want him to but am unsure if I'll vote for him, bc I think hes still going to maintain that bloated military budget that results in children around the world dying and may cut deals to cut entitlements which would horrify me and which I would feel responsible for bc I voted for him) he needs to do 3 things:

1. Run as Obama's vp, and not as the senator from Delaware. 

His record as a senator is questionable. People change and certainly Biden can too. But nevertheless his record before his time as vp is ugly. It's the typical neoliberal record, which many voters do not like (not saying they like bernies record any more than joes) but when I think of joe the vp I remember him more fondly. 

2. Run on changing foreign policy. That's something he can really do even without Congress and it's a strong message. On this I think he would be fine, and I think he wouldnt institute another Iraq war. Again, I think it's possible hes changed. 

3. He must stop attacking young people and progressives. It makes him look really bad, just like I'm sick of Bernie attacking other dems. If he wants to win he needs us , and even if hes only going to pay lip service to us and be bad towards progressives policy wise, if he wants to WIN he needs to suppress that urge. 

As I said, I'm going to sit down and write out a long paper on Biden and at the end make my decision. 

But in all seriousness I want to beat trump, and if Biden wants to win gettable progressives (some will never vote for a moderate but I'm open to the idea bc I have before and am getting sick of it) like me he needs to think about how hes going to unite the country against trump. 

His message will win the dems, but it's like hes forgotten theres a non democratic general election coming up and bc of voter suppression and other issues he will need all hands on deck, and like Bernie hes not good at it. Hes good at uniting the base of the party (registered dems, African American women) but he really doesnt like when people debate him on his record and its offputting. 

I say all this as kindly as I can, as someone who is concerned bc I've always voted dem and for the first time might not, and If someone like me is thinking that, despite being loyal in the past, then that's not a good sign. 

I'd also add I think Bernie needs to appeal to a larger audience too, but I dont think hes going to win, so that just leaves Biden. 

Downvote away if you must, but please dont ignore what I'm saying or that actually, this is a pretty fair and balanced assessment on the whole."
3666,He‚Äôs asking his supporters? The people who didn‚Äôt show up to vote?

3668,Wish I felt the same about my vote. I feel betrayed. I didn't want this and voted for Biden at least in part because he wasn't this.
3669,It's no coincidence that Biden is going after DeSantis. DeSantis was a Trump stooge from the beginning. Do wonder if health fears could depress the usual turnout of Seniors which for the most part help Republicans (outside of small pockets of Palm Beach/Broward counties of NE transplants).

2) This sentence makes no sense.

3) I could easily flip this around and put it on Bernie. Bernie had no realistic chance of winning the election before tonight. Bernie does not care about the people. He would rather continue to collect donations and prolong a primary that‚Äôs already over, putting people at risk.

4) Bernie‚Äôs policies are radical for the US and have no chance of getting passed in Congress. On top of that, Bernie‚Äôs policies are atrocious. He favors rent control which is counterproductive and makes things worse in the long run. He wants to make college free without addressing why college is so expensive here in the first place, creating an unnecessarily high burden on tax payers. He has no realistic way of funding these policies. M4A would slash funding to hospitals and clinics around the country at a time when they would need it the most. Much like his plan for free college, M4A would do little to address the underlying causes of the high costs of healthcare in this country. It‚Äôs lazy irresponsible legislation that would cripple the healthcare system in this country. His policies are poorly thought out, but do a great job of pandering to the voters by promising them ‚Äúfree‚Äù everything. And if you don‚Äôt live here, I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôre qualified to speak on what is and isn‚Äôt good for Americans."
3680,Cool!
3681,"Note: I‚Äôm a Biden supporter and a tax professional.


This doesn‚Äôt seem to me as being terribly comprehensive as it should be.  Will this apply to ALL families with equity securities?  Will it apply to inherited properties?  Will it apply only to property in excess of the 11 million exemption?  

From an accounting perspective; it‚Äôd be much easier to just not step up nontaxed assets and step up assets over the exemption amount that are being taxed upon death.

As a tax professional; I do think estate and wealth taxes  are barking up the wrong tree.  Estate taxes is a tax with no economic substance and under this proposal wherewithal to pay may not exist (IE you inherit a painting that‚Äôs several generations old, you may have to sell it to pay the tax).  What if you can‚Äôt sell this aforementioned painting?  Should the government seize other property to cover the tax debt (I‚Äôll give you a hint they have in the past)?  

Tax investment income at ordinary rates if you must; these estate taxes cause a lot more problems than one would think they would."

3692,"I feel that that is completely false. What I‚Äôve seen is a large number of people that are saying fine, we‚Äôll vote for Biden in November if that‚Äôs what y‚Äôall really want, but stop telling us to be happy about having to vote for the dude that was basically dead bottom of the pool of dem candidates for us. Yes we will vote anti trump, but we also have a right to continue voicing our progressive opinions and wants and if we shit up then the political will to get to those goals disappears."
3693,"I look at it from practicality.

We need to win the senate and cause Georgia has 2 elections and without at least 1 of them we won't get the senate, we have to have a candidate strong enough to win Georgia as well as beat Trump.

Hillary's biggest weakness was her in-authenticity and that is Bloomberg's as well whereas Biden is king when it comes to be real and authentic.

When the flurry of endorsements peppered with candidates dropping out came between SC and ST, I saw it as the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù ganging up on Bernie and his supporters. Now, I kind of see it like this: when you live and die by purity tests, you box out a lot of people. It‚Äôs not realistic to talk down to fellow Democrats who happen to support other candidates other than Bernie and expect to build a coalition. There‚Äôs a loud minority of Bernie supporters that are just assholes and divisive and it‚Äôs exhausting. Pete was right when he said that no other candidate was having that issue with their supporters. I read Biden‚Äôs platform and it *is* progressive. If enacted, especially the social welfare proposals, would be a return to LBJ‚Äôs Great Society. I can‚Äôt wait to vote for Biden in November and bring some leadership back the White House"

If it weren‚Äôt for COVID-19 I doubt he‚Äôd drop out at all, the only reason I think he might is that he‚Äôs just going to keep losing going forward, and the argument that he‚Äôs making people sick because they have to go out to vote will only get stronger. I hope I‚Äôm wrong though"
3710,"whether most deaths in total considering all crime in US is done by handguns or semi auto rifles is a different matter. it is possible that it is done by handguns because there are so many street crimes we dont even have precise data on. 

however, we are speaking of mass shootings, and on this we possess very substantial data. the deadliest shooting ever since 1949 on US soil took 58 lives, injured almost a thousand. how was such destruction possible? this individual was equipped with FOURTEEN ar-15s, EIGHT ar-10s, finally a bolt action rifle and a revolver. out of this terrifying arsenal that exceeds what an actual soldier on the battlefield has on hand (!), he fired over a thousand rounds. utilizing what was made available to him he only needed two windows and a crowd to take FIFTY EIGHT lives. 

more than that, he actually used bump stocks to fire not at semi-automatic, but almost fully automatic rate. this was so severe the Justice Department had to ban them - ban the stocks, but not the rifles. 

now, how would he do that with a handgun? we can argue and speculate that a skilled shooter would also take 50 or 40 lives even with a handgun (although it's veeeeeery doubtful), but the fact of the matter is most mass shootings were executed by weapons designed for, duh, mass shootings. to not have weapons literally designed for infantry deployed in an actual war available for US citizens would not deprive them of the right to defend themselves with other firearms. at the same time, mass shootings would be made far more difficult and far less likely. 

obviously as i have said before this is only one of the measures we should apply and just as obviously, Joe's plan goes far beyond this one policy. but it is in my opinion a good policy."
3711,"1) it was not rigged. Clinton did what Joe just did; win the black vote. That‚Äôs how you get the nomination. To suggest otherwise is erasure.

2) Sanders can‚Äôt even depend on his own supporters to vote for him when he needs them. We have no illusions about them ‚Äòfalling in line‚Äô for Joe.

3) Joe hasn‚Äôt won, yet and anything can still happen. But if he does win, we will not pressure others to join us. If they join us, it‚Äôll be because they want to.

3716,"I work in blue collar industry (metals recycling). Bernie's policies would absolutely decimate what we do. The 60+ people I manage would be unemployed were his policies enacted. This would be due to the protectionist policies, increased taxes, and inability to compete on labor. 

I represent a local company with a single location that does $25,000,000-$40,000,000 in revenue annually, but that doesn't mean net profitability. 

We are dependent, as most companies these days are, on global trade. 

So Bernie's policies would cause many working class people to lose their jobs as taxes rise. I agree entirely that income inequality is out of control. But it requires surgical precision to fix, not a hammer. 

No, he is not for the working class. He is for his ideological views, reality be damned."

3734,"This is such an important distinction. People dismiss it like ‚Äúhe was just Obama‚Äôs VP‚Äù

He was an incredibly loyal to the *first black president* who had almost no experience when he had been in the senate for 30 years. Despite not only the racial dynamic, but the age gap, the experience gap, and the massive backlash against Obama, he never once strayed from being absolutely loyal to his president. He took his cues from a guy who had been in national government for less than 1/5 the time he had. And the most disloyal thing he ever did was accidentally out Obama as being in favor of marriage equality."

The people who are in the media (ie: Journalists, Pundits, Comedians, etc...) are in tune with this online world, and take it as being indicative of the real world and have it impact subsequent coverage. Leading to very implicit pro-Bernie bias. Not to mention the bias that many networks have from intentionally hiring pro-Bernie writers, pundits, etc to present themselves as fair and balance, when a lot of these pro-Bernie pundits are obviously not acting in good faith from the start and just want to see Bernie elected. So that factor then gives you an explicit pro-Bernie bias. It's these journalists and pundits that are largely responsible for this because they are so out of touch."

3749,"I'm not really sure how I feel about the Obama coalition. I don't think Obama ended his political career on a great note. 

The left remembers him as the guy who abandoned all the progressive values and a sellout to wall street.

The moderates in Senate and Congress as I remember were all trying to distance themselves from Obama.

The right recognizes him and blames him for all the debts and calls him a socialist.

So, I'm not sure how running on Obama's name helps the Democrats. And it's not even Obama. Obama was young, hip, cool, and tan, that always helped him bypass all his questionable actions, such as, serving to wall street, pharmaceuticals, and oil companies, or spying on Americans despite promising he wouldn't do it as Bush did.

Biden is a much older, whiter, less cool, Obama, with a record of voting in favour of an illegal war. These qualities don't inspire a movement, and a movement is what we need in the very least to defeat Trump."

I'm not sure that all that pushing and shoving will gain us more than we might lose.

Nobody wants to be confronted. Nobody wants to be rushed. Nobody wants to their own reality challenged in the least.

Attempting to move them before they're ready is risky stuff. It would be best to wait till Bernie surrenders and wait a small period of grieving AND then go forth.

While Sanders continues the struggle, he denies his supporters of grieving over the loss and therefore making the ultimate job of combining everything much harder."

Now we can of course talk about how the Sanders campaign may have laid these charges at Biden through 3rd parties, bots and the like but that doesn't get us anywhere. The supporters of a politician are not the person themselves. I have been personally insulted by Biden supporters but I would never lay the blame for that with Joe himself. People are fanatical, especially on the internet, but if we can try to distance ourselves from the extreme points of view on both sides we can get down to what the majority of people think.

Biden by contrast would have the support of almost the entire Democratic Party and some of the moderate Republicans in the house and in the senate. He‚Äôs a charismatic guy who‚Äôs made a name for himself on the hill. I think Biden could be LBJ without the Vietnam war."

3772,"&gt;for Bernie, a sitting US senator, that role is going to be stressful and important and will probably take some immediate precedence over his role as a presidential candidate

Which is why it is exactly the right time to END his role as a presidential candidate by accepting that he lost and moving on. He should not be using the threat of nuisance primaries to extort Biden into making concessions. He should just bow out, do his job, and start repairing the damage he's done with his irresponsible rhetoric."

So, for example, back in the early 1920s, Warren G. Harding was involved in a massive corruption scandal, and Calvin Coolidge ran on a ""get back to normal"" campaign and won two terms that way. While progressives (like me) think that the old ways weren't that good to begin with, for the average person, not waking up in the morning bankrupt because of what our idiot president said on twitter has a lot of appeal.

Someone like Gretchen Whitmer or Amy Klobuchar could help win the midwest and push trump hard in a state like michian or Minnesota.But I would not mind Cortez Masto.

Put it this way, if the polls end up being way off or Bernie has an incredible debate and it causes a 40 point swing in his favor and Bernie wins Florida by 8 points, his chances of winning the primary have gone down. He needs to win every state by at least 12-14 points in order to gain ground because Biden has such a big lead and the proportional allocation of delegates still involves him getting some amount of delegates."

3798,"I'll take your word for it, that could very well be true. But, I think we should be focusing on convincing voters rather than hoping they'll automatically vote for Biden, or being apprehensive that they might vote Trump or leave it blank. 

Yes, to most people it's an obvious choice to vote Joe over Trump, but to many living paychecks to paycheck, teacher, working-class people, a lot of them might not be as energized to go out and vote. And it's our job to convince them to do so. 

Turnout is driven by an increased enthusiasm, Joe is driving that turnout for older Americans, but under age 45, the numbers need to improve. I think they will and hope they will, but we can't get too overconfident."
3799,"I appreciate your respect and encouragement. However, I disagree with your characterization of my opinion here.

I don‚Äôt think one‚Äôs past actions must necessarily nullify their moral high grounds... *unless they‚Äôve refused to be accountable* to them. Bloomberg has lied and obfuscated and deflected about these things and called that an apology or atonement. That makes a WORLD of difference. And it‚Äôs troubling to me, in particular, because of the impact his policies have had."
3800,"That‚Äôs not fair. 

This guy clearly said he was independent and not as posted with the Bernie campaign. 

False accusations just make you look bad."
3801,"I think you are missing the point. u/gettingphysicl is calling you guys fake shills. No one will join you, because you have nothing to join. No movement. No ideals. No vision for the future. No solutions to help the regular people of America.  Sanders' supporters and other  groups such as the DSA have been working tirelessly on the ground since 2016 to change the country for the better, not just campaign for the 2020 election. That can NOT be said about anyone claiming to be a Joe Biden supporter."

3803,"Bernie ALSO voted to cut social security as a PART of compromise bills.

The only reason that Biden has a legislative record as a leader is that Bernie has NEVER passed a bill of any significance. He has no record because he has done absolutely nothing in his 30 year career in Congress.

All bills include compromises. Are you saying that it is better to never, ever ever pass anything than to compromise and get 90% of what you want?

Congress passes a budget every year. Bernie votes for that. There are cuts to great programs all the time."
3804,"Compared to the insane amount of Bernie support on Reddit it‚Äôs hard to not say he‚Äôs the underdog. Look at the sub count on s4p and then look back here. Also literally every post that makes it to r/all is Bernie Sanders propaganda,"

3808,Some of the top people on his campaign also had glowing things to say about Biden before he dared to run against Sanders.  David Sirota said that him being chosen as Vice President showed that the progressive wing of the Democratic party had won over the corporate wing.

3818,"I‚Äôm not as concerned about the source to be honest. I‚Äôm talking about ground game. Is his campaign set with field organizers? Text volunteers? Callers? Canvassers? He went into Super Tuesday with almost none of that, and while that might work in a primary, I worry about a general.

3840,Depends on the Republican and the Democrat they're running agaisnt.
3841,"My father's been strongly pro-Dem most of his life (he said the first time he voted, which I'm guessing was '80 or '84, he was GOP, but after that he switched and never looked back), and he has strongly leftist views. However, after hearing my radical brother call Obama and Biden frauds, he said to me in an aside that people like my brother expect a ""good"" politician to be 100% perfect and do everything like how they want them to. My dad isn't super gung-ho about Biden, but says he has the experience we need - I remember back in 08, even at the height of his cynicism with politics, that he figured Biden will be a good mentor figure to Obama.

I've known a lot of people with really diverse political stances - from strongly liberal women who are nevertheless unabashedly pro-life, to evangelicals who are more liberal and believe the Dems are more moral, to solid GOP voters who are Never Trumpers Lite and support illegal immigrants and don't want to deport them, to LGBT folks who are right-wing on every issue save LGBT. In order to win in 2020, the Dems need these kinds of people - and a lot of different kinds of people, some of whom we may not always see eye to eye - and I think Biden's campaign is trying to go in that direction. We can't reject and insult them just because of a few policy differences. I'm absolutely turned off by people who may share my exact political views, but will refuse to associate with anyone who differs with them because of, say, one stance."

3864,"People keep saying VP needs to bring a state, idk how true that is. Biden didn‚Äôt really bring a specific state for Obama. What a VP does is expand your enthusiastic base. If a candidate didn‚Äôt do great with a specific demo, they could chose someone from that demo to help turnout. If the candidate is knocked for a qualification, I.e experience, their VP pick should cover that gap. Biden has a bit of a youth problem. He does half decent with suburban women, but could do better. Also some people have criticized Joes overall energy. A VPete helps with all of this and more. In Early states Pete had the highest conversion rate of former republicans voting for him. Pete flipped more Obama-Trump counties than anyone else in Iowa. Overall he compliments a lot of Joes weaknesses. I know it‚Äôs unrealistic, but choosing a Veep is not for a state it‚Äôs for a voter base."

Interestingly, Sanders is the only nominee beating Trump in these two states while Biden is tied. His base is going to be incredibly important in these two states.

Bernie said he graduated high school with a ton of black students. He graduated with three black students. That's a clear memory lapse.
Bernie said 10,000 Palestinian civilians were killed in 2014 when it was 1,000. Later said he got his facts mixed up.
In a debate, instead of saying ""those countries opposed to ISIS"", he embarrassingly said ""those countries opposed to Islam""

Bernie says Bush is the president instead of Trump in a debate and doesn't correct himself

He did the same thing twice in a hearing and only corrected himself after laughter./saying it the 2nd time

Got into the wrong plane. Even pro-Bernie TMZ called it a ""brainfart"".

Proclaimed that ""we will pass gay marriage in all 50 states"" nearly 11 months after the SCOTUS ruling. Makes no sense under any context

In live interview, Bernie Sanders called Wolf Blitzer ""Jake"" 3 times before Wolf corrected him. Then he still called him ""Jake"" 2 more times

Urged voters to support him in the Iowa caucus instead of the Nevada caucus when he was doing a rally in Vegas.

[Confuses the Iowa caucus with the Nevada caucus again.] (https://twitter.com/abbydphillip/status/1230985873979854848).

Wrongly referred to a staffer as a volunteer.
Said he ridden the subway multiple times the past year but claimed that he used ""tokens"" to ride it whentokens haven't been used for decades. That's a clear memory lapse.
Bernie ran into a shower door; it can happen to anyone, but that's especially common for senior citizens with cognition issues
Was asked about his opinion on forgiving student loan...he doesn't remotely answer the question. Says stuff completely unrelated.
BASH: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Senator Sanders, you want to forgive all student loan debt. Your response?
SANDERS: Matter of fact, I do. But before I get into that, the major issue that we don't talk about in Congress; you don't talk about in the media, is the massive level of income and wealth inequality in America.
You‚Äôve got three people who own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. You have a top 1 percent that owns more wealth than the bottom 92 percent. Forty-nine percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. Companies like Amazon and billionaires out there do not pay one nickel in federal income tax. And we‚Äôve got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street.
What we need is a political revolution that tells these billionaires and corporate America that they are Americans; they'll participate in our society, but they have got to start paying their fair share of taxes, period."
3890,"Yes, it will only show how the election day vote goes."
3891,I knew things were bad when I watched W laughably struggle to put on his rain poncho at Trump‚Äôs inauguration and some small part of me missed the Bush years.
3892,Hey waaaait a minute!  Pete's Iowa is definitely a no-malarkey zone.
3893,"Well not that I really want him to stay in, but I think it makes plenty of sense for him to do the debate and stay in for one for Tuesday of voting to at least see if things turn around. He has a ton of very enthusiastic supporters, and his campaign was in the lead for a while. So I'm sure it's really hard to give up after all that, and his supporters might not want him to just yet.  
  
Also, it gives him a chance to get Joe to move left on some issues. Bernie cares deeply about his issues like M4A, student debt, climate change, and thinks they are crucial to make our country better. If he thinks he can move the needle more on those issues by staying in longer I can't fault him for it too much, as long as he doesn't attack Biden too much.  
  
Last, Biden is going to face Trump head to head so if nothing else, Bernie staying in gives him some practice before most people are paying that much attention. Lots of swing voters aren't watching the Democratic debates so having Biden learn from these isn't necessarily a bad thing.  
  
All that to say that just because Bernie hasn't dropped out yet doesn't mean he wants Trump to win."

Just saying that because its a party that my parents supported, i will too. Thats not a good place to be in. What if the next guy who claims to be democrat, and is even more reprihensible than the president.

Joe Biden should be supported for his morals and choices or his personality, not because he wants to uphold the institution...

Thats why i suggested that.  Sticking with your party no matter what is a bad choice going forward."

It goes on to say that these sources are ""leaders of Wall Street, Silicon Valley and other industries have been reaching out to him and his presidential campaign about whom they think should join him on the ticket."" From what I understand, they're not sources within the campaign, but just people (albeit influential people) pushing their favorites onto the campaign.

'Ice cream hour with Joe Biden'"
3923,"Lot of topics here I don't know the full detail in some of them from Biden's perspective.

\-Joe will not abolish ICE but plans to hold them accountable and law abiding. He will not build a wall but it is not open borders.  There are laws.   He supports Dreamers.

\-Debt awfully broad but I think half of Americans are screwed over by the system and the rest just lack knowledge.   I have credit cards and I pay those in full.   Student debt I kind of get.  But in all they decided to go to school but I think they should be allowed to refinance and tuition needs to stablize

\-Gun Rights - He will not take guns away.  As long as you have a clean record in my opinion, you should be able to safely use it. 

\-Expand Obamacare

\-Reverse Trump taxes and raising corporate tax.

\-Green New Deal is a framework but I think it is more of a set of ideas than an actual passable legislation.  I agree with you on that.  

\-Biden supports public Community Colleges and trade schools asa path forward to good paying jobs.  

\-Trump has reversed a lot of the Michelle Obama regulations in school lunches.   I think Joe will embrace science and continue Michelle's message of healthy eating.

\-Lobbying happens.   He wants to fix Citizens United but I don't think that solves lobbying."
3924,He needs to drop out but only after Super Tuesday. We need him and Warren to get to at 15% in CA in order to help keep Sanders' delegate count down.
3925,"While youth vote is unreliable, I think Joe does need to improve on the numbers for voters between age 30-45. The numbers aren't good for that age group and could be an area for improvement."
3926,"It seems to me his manager is stating their purpose, as in why super delegates were created in the first place. Did he stand to gain from the flawed system? Yeah. Either way it is kind of silly to say Bernie is in favor of super delegates with his history of actively disliking them and attempt to change it."
3927,"NOW? Why didn't he start out supporting it? He's lying about his policies. He's the same vile shit that wants to cut social security, medicare and medicaid. What the hell is wrong with you people?  That's because Biden is a corporate whore who has been and is a stooge for insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, wall-street and oil &amp; gas. He's a fucking whore who sold his soul for political power and he won't do a damn thing for ANYONE who isn't already rich. He's a fucking loser and a lying bastard who is more of a Reagan Republican that a Democrat. Too bad lots of people are so fucking stupid they think he'll be different than Trump."
3928,This is a great video
3929,Thanks. Let‚Äôs win this thing!
3930,Why is it time to give up before the primary ends? Which is solely existent to select Biden or Bernie regardless of the race v. Trump?

3933,"It took 40 years, some very talented establishment politicians and perfect timing to get civil rights passed.  Bernie should have started making friends in 1970 instead raging against the machine.

If you want to see how something big gets done do the research on the civil rights. Roy Wilkins and HHH, people prior to MLK.  If not for the early work when the timing was right it wouldn't have happened."
3934,"Shut the fuck up dude. This is really stupid, like get a grip"
3935,"I feel like it's a double edged sword because the press covers it but also highlights the stupid shit he says like yelling at that nbc reporter. 
I feel like the news that (thankfully) begun treating him lik ethe presumptive nominee, with a ton of articles on his electoral chances, polls, and VP speculation. 
I feel like it'll continue this way for a few weeks, and when the virus hits republican states even fox news will be forced to call trump out on his shit (it's only hit cali, washingotn, and ny badly so far, thus their positive coverage). Then when there's bipartisan disdain for trump (which may come sooner with rand pauls' infection) Biden can break through as the voice of reason for everyone"
3936,This means state polls are insane for us too.
3937,"I can't with ""progressives"" threatening to withhold their vote. Imagine their reaction if Bernie became the nominee and Biden supporters will withhold their vote.

How long will some of them oppose democratic candidates for not thinking like them?"
3938,Great ad. It‚Äôs straight to the point. Using Trump‚Äôs lies against him.
3939,"Bernie also loves Chavez and Maduro, at least until recently. Another reason Florida loves him!!!"
3940,"That's not what I am saying at all. But, I am saying the woman should be taken seriously, it should be investigated the same as any other crime that is reported, and if there is no evidence, then the investigation should be dropped. It's unfortunate that sometimes, evidence is just nonexistant, and so the accused never sees justice, but also, false accusations do happen, and she has been on record praising Putin, and her story has changed... so I am also worried that if the media runs with it and it turns out to be false, Biden will still be irrepairably stained."
3941,"Being a Pete person originally, I am all for RoTR and have been welcoming. There have been a lot of Bernie supporters coming in peace and showing honest interest in Joe's campaign, and I love that. What I will NEVER understand is how someone could claim to value the things Bernie values, yet say, ""screw it, I'll vote for Trump"" (or a third party, which is a vote for Trump)."
3942,"1.	I support Joe Biden for President. Admittedly, I did briefly move over to /r/Pete_Buttigieg after Iowa, and then later moved back to Biden but stayed out of campaign subs for a while, but after last night‚Äôs big win, I am fully back here to be a part of this community for the rest of the primaries.

3951,"To be fair, it's only not at the top because of a global pandemic. The Bernie Bots seem to be gone. Theres basically 0 posts about him."
3952,"I‚Äôm saying like Republicans who have a conscience. Republicans who dont want more trump. Sure maybe you voted for him last time, who could have known he was gonna be like this. I liked him too but after seeing what he‚Äôs done in office I can‚Äôt see how people want another term. 

So when I say Republicans of conscience I mean people that know that a Trump second term is the wrong direction for this country. I would have happily voted for Romney or McCain but trump was just way too far and selfish imo. 

And yeah there is racism and sexism in America on both sides for sure. This nomination is bringing out the worst in the far left that‚Äôs for sure. 

I agree the best political conversations are like this, we might not agree on every single thing, but don‚Äôt just shut people down because they won‚Äôt bend the knee. Idk if you like game of thrones but in r/neolib **We do not kneel** lmao.

We are all Americans who want freedom, democracy and security."

3956,"Oh I know it's bad and will only get worse. I have been traveling internationally and things are nutty out there. My girlfriend had to cancel her planned trip and my colleague is at the airport right now panicking a bit.

I am just imagining what it would be like to get bumped up to first class and then have a bunch of coughing Italians fill the plane."
3957,"I am a Bernie Sanders supporter, and all I have come here to say is this. Bernie has denounced anyone who uses hate or vicious attacks against any candidate including Warren and Biden. I am not here to tell you who to vote for, or what you should support. Bernie himself is fighting a clean fight. He may ultimately lose the nomination but the man practice what he preaches.

Don't let the voices of a radical few shape your opinion of Bernie Sanders. I ask you only judge him on what he is campaigning for. If you believe that he is not your cup of tea I can definitely support that, but there are definitely people on both sides who could use a chill pill. No matter who you vote for just go out and vote as that is the most important thing here at the end of the day!"
3958,"As Nancy Pelosi said, if you want to do something more then get the votes.  It's not that Pelosi is resistant to some of the things people are fighting for, she just knows what will pass the House and what can pass the Senate."

3963,Bernie has plenty of gaffes. So by your standards Bernie has dementia too. It's a ridiculous standard for either candidate. Instead of debating the issues you go into these nasty attacks. Part of the reason why I voted early for Biden yesterday.
3964,There is a reason the black community is supporting Biden and not Bernie.  We see the man behind the curtain.
3965,Why are you Bernie -&gt; Biden?
3966,"&gt;seeking help to understanding why I should vote for him if he is the one against trump.

This may be downvoted but honestly, if it's Biden vs trump in the general.. not voting just makes it that much easier for trump to win. Biden is good with people, he likes people. He sees the country in a positive light. I can't understand why people say they won't vote for him when obviously he is a much more progressive candidate than TRUMP."

3969,"1. Ted Cruz is Cuban American.
2. Birtherism didn't work as an electoral strategy"
3970,Thank you! I loves me some positive energy.  Let's turn the Orange Godzilla out of the White House.
3971,"As an unconvinced former Pete supporter... why does it feel like Biden doing absolutely *nothing* to get his name and face out there during a national health crisis?


Yes, he tweeted a campaign plan on his website...cool. Show up on TV. Write or say some shit worth writing about. Do something."
3972,"Hey I thought that Andrew was running for mayor of NYC‚Ä¶ Does that seem like that‚Äôs not happening? I was really looking forward to seeing him after DeBlasio being..... the mayor. Lol. Regardless I‚Äôm grateful he‚Äôs staying in public service. I would be happy with VP too but I‚Äôll take.... anything he‚Äôs wants to do

(My dream is the development of a Dept of Tech to deal with automation, data security, election security, privacy etc and let Andrew run the whole thing. Kinda like how Liz created the CPB) 


Thanks for your interest in Joe. 

Just FYI as a nurse who has worked with lots of elderly patients, dementia and other issues, I hope we can hold off on diagnoses of candidates. I do agree that he‚Äôs not a young man, I hear you when you say he has lost a step. That being said, how can anyone look smart next to guys like Yang? And while Bernie does yell a lot, you‚Äôll find a lot of info on his ‚Äúforgetfulness‚Äù and slips, and nothing on his serious heart issues. 

At any rate, we‚Äôre stuck with a gang of grandpas and they need to surround themselves with smart and young voices (Andrew, Liz and Pete instantly come to mind) but for now, I‚Äôm laser focused on defeating trump. Anyway, welcome. 

Do you have any specific questions that maybe we can help answer?"
3973,Looks to me like he has united the party better than I could have imagined.
3974,Anyone else noticing that r/politics is showing signs of life in the comment sections?
3975,Kinda same boat! I volunteered for both and am 100% voting for Joe now. Pete‚Äôs going to do great things in the future- I hope he gets a cabinet position! üíï
3976,I hadn't thought of that. Traitor trump's desperation is increasingly obvious now when I look at the progression.
3977,What is your definition of ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù?
3978,\#ProgressivesForBiden
3979,"Well then, TIL!"
3980,lol it's not fair Biden has decent political instincts and knows how to make friends
3981,"So you go into a candidates sub who has now dropped out and is irrelevant to the campaign to be negative and are surprised when they respond negatively? 

She's helping Biden but not endorsing Sanders (who was always more likely to win her endorsement). In addition, her endorsement does nothing as her prior supporters have all but made up their mind

There are a lot of prior warren supporters here and you are doing nothing to help Biden with this

Edit: I read your comments. They clearly break the subs rules and just read as you looking to start a fight"
3982,"Biden said we have to keep our eye on the cure 
And we have to get supplies to the hospitals instead of just standing around...I agree...we shouldn‚Äôt just stand around..."
3983,Me too
3984,You know things are bad when even Fox News isn‚Äôt buying your story.
3985,"Helped him win michigan, standing against NRA 

Sanders voted for preventing gun manufacturers from being sued 5 times and then to top it off voted against Brady bill for background checks

Finally someone who can beat NRA but also protect 2nd amendment"
3986,These guys can't even show up to vote in the primaries.
3987,Has she explained why her story changed?
3988,"I don‚Äôt think what you said about Hillary to Obama voters is true. The real stat is that more people went Hillary to McCain than went Bernie to Trump. But I believe about 85% of Hillary voters went for Obama and about 75% of Bernie voters went for Hillary. The issue was that Bernie supporters stayed home or went third party. 

Doesn‚Äôt change the point that you‚Äôre making. I agree."
3989,"Definitely Harris. I really don't know what Abrams stands for tbh. She fights for voting rights, but doesn't really have history on any other issue."
3990,Any idea why there are states (e.g. Washington) that we can't phonebank into? I think a win in Michigan and Washington KOs the opposition in a week's time.
3991,"Are you a sports fan? I like basketball a lot so I'll try that. 

IA/NH/NV were the first quarter and Bernie was up 12. Now we're in the third quarter and Biden is up 30. On top of that, Bernie's two best players got injured. 

This is how you get to a 99.9% certainty. There's just not enough time left and Biden is too far ahead. Bernie might do well, but Joe will keep scoring and it's extremely unlikely Bernie ever catches up."
3992,"Fuck man, that really sucks"
3993,"As a diehard, long-time Pete supporter, Biden's my guy now. No question. Time to end the malarkey."
3994,Plenty of liberals support Joe. Plenty of progressives do too. Joe is running on the most progressive platform ever. The fact it's considered moderate is crazy.
3995,Appreciate the clarification. I came to the wrong place.
3996,"Yeah, this is pretty much the best possible scenario for Sanders given current polling. I think Biden wins Michigan by a decent margin and might win WA narrowly depending on how many early votes were wasted on candidates who've dropped out now. Missouri will be a very strong win for Biden."
3997,A lot of student loans come directly from the federal government while the others don‚Äôt so it makes sense as a federal government response
3998,"Thank you for your kind congratulations. While I must confess I still don't understand the draw of Trump (although given I was a bush era republican in my youth) , I am happy that you came here to offer your congratulations with respect and civility. These are the ways towards a better dialogue between real people, not radicalized factions. I hope to see more of people like you. Peace be upon you and your kin."
3999,"aye, rose twitter is just the fringe arm of his supporters."
4000,"Nuclear is not clean and safe. The way that it generates last for tens of thousands of years, a legacy of incalculable risk that we are imposing on the people who come after us. 3 Mile Island, Chernobyl, Fukushima Daiichi, no it‚Äôs not safe. I‚Äôm pragmatic enough to recognize that we will certainly be using it in the next several decades, but it is not something to be celebrated but rather tolerated at best."
4001,"It‚Äôs alright, let them vent. No need to pick fights or gloat, but it can be helpful to share data that contradicts that doomer narrative."
4002,"1. Did you note how in states Biden won yesterday, turnout was astronomical?  In many of them he didn't advertise or visit.  He is the poster candidate of ""not Trump"" as a likeable member of the Obama administration.  The point of debates isn't to tear people down, but to be likeable.  Biden made himself everyone's second choice, and Bernie put a hard ceiling on his support.  As yesterday showed, Biden is winning based on this.  Biden improved in his last debate, and will be better still.  Trump is no longer an unknown.  There's plenty to hammer him with.

2. By being likeable, having a meaningful agenda, and actually being able to execute on it.  However, winning is more about picking up independents and anti-Trump Republicans.  Sorry, it's just electoral math.  We're going to win CA and VT no matter what as Democrats, and UT is going to stay Republican in all but a blowout landslide.

3. Biden was broke.  Bloomberg is now handing over much of his infrastructure, will fund, and Biden just raised $6M in one day.  Pete fundraisers are coming on board as well.  Organization is coming fast.  I have been contacted about six new offices in my state."
4003,"So because you were here earlier you get the right to make this subreddit seem more toxic than it is? 

Interesting. 

(The fact that you don‚Äôt get the irony of telling me to get of my high horse and then proceeding to explain how much better you are because of how long you‚Äôve been here is hilarious.)"
4004,"OMG! This is making me remember that my class took a similar picture, but I can‚Äôt remember whom with.

Edit: It was with Ted Kennedy and John Kerry!"
4005,"Harris, Castro, and Booker were a progressive.   I even think Biden and Buttigieg are progressives. You'd have to go to people like Delaney,  Bullock, or Bennet so start finding actual moderates.  

I hate the ""true progressive thing.  You don't have to be 100% to the left on every issue to be progressive. Warren is a populist progressive.   She can also be pragmatic and is not a snake."
4006,"
 nothing wrong with supporting or voting for Bernie. Just know we re on the same side and blue no matter fucking who"
4007,"Would rather have Kamala in the WH, in any capacity."
4008,I love this!!!!
4009,"&gt; but I'm heavily skeptical.

Same especially since you know Obama vetted the Diamond"
4010,"White, male liberals who are pro-gun are common on Reddit but make a small amount of the electorate in real life. Vast majority of Democrats are for gun safety laws, and we would lose more people by giving up on that than gain people. Part of the suburban women shift to Democrats is because of pushing for background checks and other common restrictions."
4011,The Hill is mostly conservative except Krystal Ball who is the biggest Bernie Bro of all time. I liked The Hill when Yang was in since they gave him fair coverage but since he dropped they have become insufferable and refuse to believe the average American prefers Biden to Burnie
4012,"Team work, you got my back, I've got yours."
4013,Just wash your hands before and after and don't touch your face until after you wash your hands after.

4019,"To save people some time reading the full thing , one key claim that's not something a person would need to alter in service of protecting their reputation, she claimed she quit her job because her true vocation was her calling to the arts and more recently has switched that to saying she was fired for mentioning something that happened to her. Basically when it suited she seems to have used the end of her political (staffer) career as credit towards her affinity for the arts and things like a political philosophy that is so enlightened it recognises Putin as a humanitarian who is 'magnetic' to American women via his love of animals, children and sports.

I'm not citing issue with her Russian opinion, it just doesn't sound like a sane version of a positive opinion on Russia (which would be nuanced and not have lovey Dovey stuff about how alluring Putin is)"
4020,"Pete is the first politician I‚Äôve ever donated to (in part because this is my first election cycle not being in some form of higher education), but I‚Äôm thinking the second will be Joe."

4022,"Your post was removed, by the way."
4023,"what is infuriating is the other primaries should be cancelled, keep people at home. But if that is done the conspiracy theories will go insane. 

If Bernie has the same strong finish he had vs. Clinton he loses.

If he continues how he is doing he loses huge.

If he somehow miraculously flips the script and started performing like Biden...he still loses."
4024,"At best it was a stalemate between both, and if there's a clear winner it would be Bernie. Just based off how they both acted and responded. There's plenty of propaganda out against everybody, that's why you have to ignore anything you aren't personally witnessing. Watching both of them debate made it clear that one had plans to help the people, while the other had plans to be elected. Biden is just a rehash of the status quo, which has been failing for decades."
4025,"So this is from the 2016 election then...

The thing is, most people dont need Russian bots to tell them not to vote for michael bloomberg, ever. You have to be pretty dumb to support bloomberg. Most supporters are concerned with the DNC allowing someone else to become the nominee even if Bernie goes into the convention with a plurality. If that happens, then yea, a lot of people wont support a nominee that is appointed against the will of voters. Not something that Russians convinced anyone of. That is just having basic principles and respect for the democratic process. If another candidate becomes the nominee fairly than most bernie supporters will also back that person. 

But let's not pretend there isnt a never bernie movement out there with plenty of Democrats saying they wouldn't support him. Are those just russian trolls too though? When Bernie supporters dont want to vote for another person, they are stupid and tricked by Russia to think that. When a moderate doesnt want to vote for Bernie they are enlightened

Memes arent convincing Bernie supporters to not like Pete, Amy, Bloomberg, Warren, or Biden. It's who they are or their policies or both."
4026,"He needs to retire from Media, he is an emotional hack

4030,Well thanks for being the team player!!! We need boots on the ground in every state.
4031,"I love this idea and agree it would be really helpful. Especially since he‚Äôs now setting up his own ‚Äúshadow‚Äù committee, it would be comforting to hear updates on what is being done and what the experts are saying. And a casual video in his home or wherever would be a great format of delivery."
4032,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X3UiSvgle0 Can someone explain this to me?
4033,"One article doesn't prove your point that it was the first time he was asked to explain a plan. That's cherry picking. Numerous town halls had already gone on at the point. However, this is ultimately not that important; you seem very well prepared to compare the coverage in 2016 to that of 2019-20. What do you think of how the coverage differs?"
4034,"I think universal single payer is the ultimate goal, and really the only way to guarantee complete coverage to everyone while also controlling costs, but with our current system being so entrenched giving a true public option to start off seems like the smart move.  

Given legislation to allow it to negotiate costs better than Medicare currently does (and thus make premiums affordable) it should become a popular choice, which will eventually allow it to take over the market."
4035,Yes-sireee!
4036,"I'm not sure where you are getting 50% from. I haven't seen much rudeness from Bernie supporters at all. And when I do, there's usually another Bernie supporter telling them to knock it off. 

Claiming you can judge an entire group based on a few who behave badly stinks of bigotry. I'm sorry, but you really are generalizing a large and diverse group based on a small number of jerks. That's not fair to the people who are nice and try to police the bad behavior.

I've talked to some really toxic Biden supporters out there, but I don't judge you or the rest of his supporters based on those few people.

Frankly, I think this whole 'Bernie bros are jerks' rhetoric is exaggerated by the media, and people buy that narrative as an excuse to attack regular citizens. Why not focus on the candidate and his policy instead of trying to divide the democratic party. We may favor different candidates, but we're in this together. We're all working towards a better world even if we have different ideas of how to get there. It's not me vs you. It's me and you vs regressive conservative republican politicians. At least that's how I see it. I hope you can try and see it that way too."
4037,You know he had to pick a running mate before he gets elected. Right?
4038,"Oh no, I'm old now."
4039,Pretty sure this type of 'post this to the top' happened on all the canidates subreddit.

4042,"Uhg, she fell apart in the election for a reason, I really hope not."
4043,You are being naive if you think Trump is influencing the democratic primary in any capacity similar to the DNC and the mainstream media.  Biden is the posterboy.
4044,"He committed during the last debate to a woman VP. I wish it could have been Yang, but I know that was never realistic :/
I personally hope it's Klobuchar because 1) I like her and 2) I'm not sure Kamala would give him a boost with any voters who weren't already going to vote Democratic in the general election."
4045,"You‚Äôre going to need to elaborate on that 

The whole argument has been against the status quo

Bernie has announced publicly his admiration for breadlines, they‚Äôre a good thing. His words.

Are you inventing what you think his administration will be or are you hearing what he‚Äôs telling you it will be."

IMO running on Bernie's bill will result in losing the presidency and House majority and prevents a Senate majority.

We can debate how popular Bernie's bill is among the Dem electorate, depending on how much you think people know what's in it. [I think it's much clearer it is not popular now, and will grow increasingly unpopular, in the general](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-february-2020/).

I'm supportive of a primarily single payer system. I think it's great to discuss the merits of it and try to continue to push things in that direction. But I much more support beating Donald Trump and preventing the GOP from controlling both houses ... and having a united platform (most Senate and House candidates support the public option) with a policy most Americans want and will significantly get more people covered and lower/cap costs ... and to have a mandate to get it done when we win."

This may be unpopular here, but I do not think there should be elections in those states tomorrow. I just hope and I'm really hoping that Bernie ends this insanity tomorrow by dropping out and after seeing the path for him has closed. We need to have Joe and democrat party voters for that matter, in the best condition possible going forward"

4097,"I'd also add in a lot of young people get their news from social media and YouTube, which makes them extremely susceptible to propaganda campaigns. A lot of them buy all the outrageous smears of Biden (and other moderate or even progressive candidates) hook, line, and sinker, because they don't know any better. Add to the fact they've been poisoned against the mainstream media, and they're in a bubble as disconnected from reality as Fox News, just in the opposite direction. They really, truly think Biden is a monster and anyone who supports him must be a monster too.

And the bullying is real. I was bullied on campus for being a moderate neoliberal sellout because I supported *Elizabeth Warren*."

4099,"Come on. This isn't even disingenuous, it's straight up dishonest. 

We're better than to spread clear lies about the other candidates. 

While I didn't agree fully with him talking about Castro in a positive light it was clear he was only talking about Castro's literacy initiative. He clearly said that Castro was mostly wrong but even in the worst regimes they sometimes get something right. 

Which is true, but maybe we avoid even bringing up dudes like Castro. 

But to say he's pro-Castro is just dishonest and we're better than that"

4104," You are confusing campaigning with tons of public appearances. Biden has got more endorsements today than any week or month of the primary. The Biden campaign is currently working in the next five states and they have got more endorsements and cash in the past week than most campaigns in the past year.

They are currently focusing on making calls. Please help make calls if you want but saying that the Biden campaign is lazy or not doing work makes zero sense.

They are getting plenty of free media. Doing talk shows isn‚Äôt the only way to get media and it‚Äôs not the most effective.

I talked to three different members of the Biden campaign today and they are all working their butts off. They are also working smart and going to win big next Tuesday again which will be another round of free media that Bernie can‚Äôt get."
4105,GMOs can be harmful and/or less nutritious.
4106,Does Joe have an official response to these rape allegations going around? I'd like to be able to reference it
4107,Some of that may have been from when the head of the DNC had to step down and apologize for screwing the Sanders campaign though. I get the sentiment though but their anger seems at least partially justified in my opinion.

4109,"Just Googled her. I guess this could help with Latinos so I'm all for it. Arizona becomes a legitimate place to flip and maybe helps us in Florida.

EDIT: After thinking about it a little bit more, Biden is already solid with black voters but he could use more help with Latinos. According to 2016 exit polls 12% of voters were black and Hillary won 89-8. 11% of voters were Latino and Trump got 28% of that pie(35% in Florida alone). Not necessarily saying that's why Hillary lost(ratfuckery by Comey) but she could help immensely"
4110,"I didn't realize we were talking about a specific dollar figure.  As a concept if you index it to local cost of living it would take the place of food stamps at least, maybe HUD also.  I'm assuming Medicare for all you wouldn't have to pay premiums."
4111,"Good point. I'll see what they say on the call but maybe I'll apply and then worry about paying for it. I have the time off work, so there's that at least. I am sure that the cost will be addressed on the call anyway, and I can't imagine the party expecting us to spend thousands of dollars just on hotels."
4112,"The only real differences between Bernie and the rest of the field was the extent he was proposing/promising.  On every policy the Dems are aligned.  It's not about ""what"" should be done that makes the differences, it's about ""how"".  I wouldn't get to caught up in the details now. This will all get fleshed out at the convention and written into the party platform.

This latest claim was driven by a desperate Bernie surrogate looking for an angle and giving the pro Russia influencer a platform to try and make this seem like a new thing again.

4139,The issue i think is that Biden's plans seem mild compared to Bernie. But the truth is that Biden would still be the most progressive nominee in history. Talk about how Biden's plans meet their values and compare them to Trump.
4140,"You're reading a lot into my question.

I'm an Australian who's main viewpoint into the states is through Reddit as I avoid mainstream news media because it's all owned by Murdoch down here.

All I know of Biden is that he was vice-president to Obama, who was a great president. I can't seem to find what policies he's pushing (like M4A, universal income, etc.) other than providing unity and beating Trump.

What happens after he beats Trump? He just tries to undo what Trump did? Cause that's all well and good but down here we have a government that spends the majority of its time complaining about the other party even though they're not in power and we're getting no where.

So, it's a legitimate question:

What does Biden bring to the table other than unity and maybe beating Trump?"
4141,"The Democrats won a 57 to 41 (effectively 59 to 41) majority for the 2009-2010 Congress, that majority fell to 51 (53) to 47 for the 2011-2012 Congress, they then extended their majority to 53 (55) to 45 for the 2013-2014 Congress, before the Republicans finally gained control starting in 2015.

That's why Harry Reid was Senate Majority Leader for all of Obama's presidency until January of 2015."
4142,"Why? Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to just have a UBI and let businesses pay whatever a person‚Äôs labor and services are worth? I really don‚Äôt understand this notion that businesses are supposed to act as charities, seems more like the government‚Äôs job to ensure a basic standard of living."
4143,"[RCP has Trump +2.6 in Texas in their polling average.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/Texas.html)

Right before the 2016 election? He [averaged +11.7 and won by +9.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/tx/texas_trump_vs_clinton-5694.html)

So if the polling average was just as off in 2020, Biden would narrowly win there. Of course, that's not guaranteed, but if nothing else it's looking shockingly competitive."
4144,There are dozens of them!
4145,"Bernie has been key at moving the party towards more progressive goals that are now mainstream within the democratic party and should be commended for that but it's time for him to drop out. 

He basically ran for president of Michigan these last 4-5 days. He went all in, he ditched MS for MI and still lost. There's no path for him moving forward and it'll be worse for him next week when Florida is in play where he is expected to get mauled badly. Numbers don't lie.. it's over. For the better of the party, they should all unite behind Biden."
4146,"Yes, there have always been these people, even back when Obama ran, but it just seems like the issue has gotten more and more rampant with social media playing a larger role in daily lives of people.

4160,I think after mid-March they don't plan them in advance anymore and decide on it as the race goes on. You don't see very many presidential primaries that go on for this long.
4161,"I think Biden will do well in AZ‚Äî with one counterpoint: Bernie has been doing better with Latinos/Hispanics. So, it‚Äôs not going to be easy. Uncle Joe has millions more in just the last week (around $20m I‚Äôd guess) and hopefully has been building out his infrastructure since last week."

His unwillingness to take any measures to deter them whatsoever. 

&gt;That's untrue. Sanders did over 4 times as many rallies for Clinton than she did Obama.

He did 400 rallies? Do you have a source for that?

&gt;When has Russia attacked the US? The Crimea fiasco happened under Obama btw.

You might check out the Mueller Report and the bipartisan senate report on Russian attacks on the US to get a good view.

* Hacking and stealing sensitive data, both at the population level and the political level

* Attacking critical US infrastructure

* Military psy-ops campaign waged against ordinary Americans

* Targeting extremists and the mentally ill and converting them into white supremacists mass shooters


&gt;The Crimea fiasco happened under Obama btw.

And Sanders refused to punish Putin for it. One of the reasons they started giving him illegal election help."
4190,"The lack of an audience in the debate, the format and the backdrop of a pandemic makes me think Sunday will be more of a conversation between two colleagues (who genuinely like each other) who agree on a common goal but disagree on the tactics to reach those goals, rather than a shouting match like we saw in every other debate before now.

I think it's also an opportunity for Biden to reach out to Bernie's supporters and Bernie is setting things up that way. Bernie himself is not Bernie or bust. He's part of the democratic leadership team in the senate. That tells you something about his state of mind too.

That being said, I don't know how Bernie stays in the race beyond next week."
4191,"He whispered it to Barack in front of an open mic haha. It‚Äôs difficult to hear on video, but I‚Äôm sure was louder in person üòÇ"
4192,"He may be guarding his gold, but if we're not careful he will awake from his hibernation and lay waste to Lake Town."
4193,"And yet he‚Äôs still the best man for the job.  

Get out and vote, people!!  üíéüêä"
4194,"Not true.  Bowing out right after Michigan would have been abrupt.  Like I said , lets see how he behaves at the debate, how Tuesday night goes , and what happens by Wednesday.  If he is in hard core attack mode at that debate I will then change my opinion."
4195,"Joe Biden has already released 21 years of his tax returns. Trump hasn't released one. What's he hiding?

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/JoeBiden) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
4196,"Have you considered going to Joe's campaign website to read his plans? 

I'm a Warren supporter and while I still feel Liz is the best person for the job, she is right in that she (a progressive) and Biden have a lot they agree on. His climate change plans have us reaching carbon neutral by 2050 and he's okay with Nuclear power as a bridge fuel. 

I personally care about international relations and I think that Biden is far superior to Liz and Bernie in that regard."
4197,CA works harder than most states to ensure every vote is fairly counted. This comes at the cost of expedience and the long count was fully expected.
4198,"Thanks for your question! Although I have never been a Bernie supporter, I have nothing against Bernie and the majority of his supporters. I have, however, been the subject of online harassment by some of them, and I suspect this is the reason why many in the Biden camp are hesitant to answer good faith questions like the ones you have asked. We don't hold you in contempt. It is only when we see allegations of election rigging (conveniently brought up when Bernie loses) and ad hominem attacks against Biden (sometimes retweeted from right-wing Trump supporting accounts by Bernie staffers) that we hold people in contempt. 

Now to the meat of your question: It's not my place to tell you how to vote. We live in a two-party system. Assuming the Democratic nominee is Biden, that means there is a binary choice. One candidate supports climate change reform (including the framework of the Green New Deal), while the other claims it is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. One candidate supports universal healthcare by way of a public option, while the other does not. One candidate supports campaign finance reform, including an amendment to overturn Citizens United and make elections publicly funded, while the other does not. My politics are to the left of Joe Biden. I agree with him maybe 75-80% of the time. I agree with Trump 5% of the time. Biden was not my first choice either. I wish he would embrace the democratic reforms championed by Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren (such as filibuster reform). However, I am voting for him because he would steer this country in a far better direction than Trump. David Pakman, a huge Bernie supporter, makes this point on his podcast. The mantra is not ""vote blue no matter who"". It is, ""with the choice before us, I prefer Biden's policy stances to Trump's"".

Will he run this country exactly the way I'd like it? Probably not. But at the end of the day, that's not the choice being presented to us. Only two people have a chance of winning: Joe Biden or Donald Trump. I would urge against the narrative I often see in Bernie-dominated circles, which seeks to draw some type of equivalence between Trump and Biden. In terms of policies, they have almost nothing in common. I fear this type of false equivalence will lead some people to vote third party. I understand the frustration that your guy didn't (or won't, I should say) win the nomination. However, if 2016 is a lesson, it should show that protest voting (as many did for Jill Stein) doesn't solve anything. The Bernie or busters in 2016 did not ""stick it to the DNC"". Moderate dems still flipped pretty much every district that went from red to blue in 2018. Meanwhile, we ended up with a President Trump. I'm not blaming these people for protest voting - but I think it's pretty clear that they did not gain much (if anything) from doing it. I wish you the best in your decision making process and hope you end up choosing to vote for Biden in the general."
4199,"Biden wants to improve the repayment numbers too, so it's 5% and 20 years.  One of my friends posted on facebook an article about someone with crushing debt who says if Bernie isn't nominated he might just give up and vote trump. So I posted that they didn't have to give up, if that's their issue clearly Biden is better than Trump, right? No. I was asked not to respond to her political posts again. :(

It's like that with every one of Biden's policies. They're either very close to Bernie's, some are even the same, or at least they give Bernie supporters something. But they don't care. It's all about fighting the establishment."
4200,"Judge Judy is dope, I‚Äôd ship it"
4201,i'd say an old man pedophile is a good deal worse.
4202,In what way?
4203,"Biden wants to raise taxes on the rich and give everyone a public healthcare option. That in and of itself shows that he can‚Äôt be that pro-corporation. He wants to end prison profiteering and end private funding for elections. I don‚Äôt see how this is pro-corporation. Also I was paraphrasing Sanders and his supporters, who have been less than friendly toward POC supporting Biden."
4204,Nope.
4205,Yeah. I saw this coming and sold my stocks and told everyone HEY WATCH OUT. I dont see a prob if the politicians did the same. It didnt take a genius to see this could be really really bad
4206,"Guys, Harris is 100% the VP"
4207,But he also voted to confirm Supreme Court justices appointed by Trump and a whole gaggle of other shit.
4208,is anyone surprised uncle joe wants a female vp?
4209,"It's not that I disagree with her or her sentiments. I disagree with how she talks at people and how she bludgeons them even when we mostly agree.

I had a colleague from New Jersey who was like this. When I told her that I felt that she talked down to me and disrespected me even when I agreed with her she said ""No you do not."" I was like uhhhh, you cannot tell someone how they feel. AOC comes off like this and I think it might be her NYC culture. It's abrasive and offensive to my Midwestern sensibilities. AOC makes me go -_- when she is moralizing fellow liberals."

4215,"Oh I didn‚Äôt take it disrespectfully at all, don‚Äôt worry. I apologize if it came out that way lol. I guess it was just surprising as hell to me that they believed it since they seem like calm, level headed people. Though they were able to convince her mom (my aunt) to not go on a trip to North Carolina this upcoming week, so I guess some good came from it lol.

They were sharing that meme on Facebook about how gargling salt water will kill the virus so I honestly take it with a grain of salt lol.

She asked me how I thought it started and I said well I‚Äôve read a few scientific reports (that I found here on Reddit) explaining it came from consuming an animal that was infected with it and then she just went on about population control and WW3.

But surprisingly they‚Äôre not hoarding or doing anything crazy. She thinks people hoarding food, tp and guns are wackadoos. Which to be fair, yeah.

It was just so weird to me that she fell that deep in a rabbit hole."
4216,"Cool, thanks for your super thought out response. I get that in some things we disagree, namely that I hardly trust any politician to begin with and doubt that most any of them will ever actually act to better the lives of normal people, but I really value that you‚Äôve taken the time to share your perspective!"

4219,"&gt; So your plan is

I never said anything about my plan, so there's a good sign you're putting words in my mouth.

We have tax-payer funded public schools in the US, but we saw no need to *prohibit* private schools. If you send your kid to private school, you're still paying the public school tax.

So why is there a need to *prohibit* private insurance? If there's a public option (and Joe's webpage actually does say it's something anyone can buy in to) a lot of employers will have that be the insurance they're paying for. If there's a universal auto-enrolled program (as others have proposed), then most employers will probably drop insurance from their compensation packages. But in either case, why can't someone who wants to spend more on private insurance over and above the public plan do that?"
4220,He does lawyer
4221,"Independent voters DON'T hate Trump? Do you have statistically significant data to substantiate this claim? Most polls including the only non-fake news media outlet called Fox shows Trump's approval rating is very poor outside the GOP base.

Plus, lots of independent already voted against Trump in 2016, which is why he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes.

I do agree that as an incumbent Trump will not be easy to defeat. But don't come out here and brag about Trump's popularity just because you and your friends support him regardless of what he says or does."
4222,"Yeah I have some ""bernie bros"" on my fb feed and I just came here to see how much of these were lies. I like Sanders but tbh his supporters make me embarrassed to admit that"
4223,"This is why I was a Warren voter.  I spent years in M4A advocacy, and Warren was the only candidate with an M4A plan, a vision, and the temperament to make it happen.  I hate that so much malarkey has become a major distraction from the issue that makes Bernie‚Äôs platform so attractive to the millions of people voting for him.  He‚Äôs hardly a natural politician, but he‚Äôs a good man and he‚Äôs been on the right side of history long before it was popular.  Joe‚Äôs both a good man and a natural politician, but he‚Äôs been wrong on a lot of issues.  Neither are perfect, both come with a lot of baggage, and it‚Äôs easy to see why they‚Äôre the ones left standing.  Looking forward to having our nominee so we can take it to the conservatives."
4224,Yikes guys.  We support whoever gets it.   Stop the in fighting.
4225,There are several swing states in which the number of votes for Jill Stein (a fav of many Bernie or busters including Brie Brie Joy) exceeded the lead trump held over Clinton. So it wasn‚Äôt an insignificant factor in the 2016 election. I agree that we need to focus on positive expansion of the coalition but acting like this wasn‚Äôt an issue isn‚Äôt helpful either
4226,"Lmao Donny is definitely going to win another term. Unbelievable because he sucks but the people have spoken! Going to have time to groom and market another candidate though, so that's a positive."
4227,Florida and Ohio is what it comes down to electorally take those who stop any republican chance
4228,Watching Biden speak wisely and normally this morning makes me despair for the debates with 45 before November. I remember thinking Hillary Clinton was far too good and had to stoop very low to debate the orange toddler. Now we have to watch a man of dignity like Biden debate him. Lord give me strength.
4229,MATH!
4230,"Every time a reporter ask him if he would consider ""X"" as a running mate Joe says yes because he likes to say he would consider anyone.   But he then goes on to explain what he is looking for in a running mate and it becomes obvious that X would not be a serious contender."
4231,Every dollar is needed to beat Trump. Make no mistake.
4232,"I could be wrong, but I feel like Sanders wants to have one more debate, one more time to push the ideas he and his supporters have been fighting for, and then we will see him drop out. I could be wrong, but I feel like he won't take it as far this cycle. So I'd agree to one more debate and then done."
4233,"Nope, she still embraced corporate donors and it was apparent she was at best Bernie lite.  When I say Bernie light I mean not free of corporate influence."

4237,Now Bernie's talking about the Troops? Really. Wow. Mind Blown!
4238,"I‚Äôm doubtful. As the other guy said Steyer canvassed the entire state, and people are pretty negative on stop and frisk and Bloomberg‚Äôs attempt to brute force coverage."
4239,I said this weeks ago. Bernie wont quit because of his ego. If he really cared for his people/the world in general he'd stop now and do everything he could to help unite the party and get Biden elected.
4240,And he is supportive of nuclear which is a major deal for people like me. Bernie‚Äôs distaste for nuclear energy was one of the first things to move towards Joe.
4241,"Considering voting for Joe in Maryland. I'm sure that the primary will be all but wrapped up by then but my vote has still been hanging on my mind a lot. I'm curious, why do you support Joe Biden?"

4243,KATIE PORTER
4244,"But Sanders won North Dakota!!!!

4245,"Bernie def in Arles throws more money at climate policy but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs better the green new deal doesn‚Äôt include a carbon tax and his ban on nuclear would be disastrous as nuclear as a great way to quickly and drastically reduce emission.

It‚Äôs important to remember that a plans ambition or efficacy is not decided by home much you spend or how much it faces opposition from conservatives"
4246,"Ugh, you're so right on the media. They can't help but repeat every stupid thing Trump says into the megaphone because it generates clicks and makes them money. He makes himself look bad enough, I hope Joe focuses on his positive vision for America instead."
4247,2 votes for Biden in California which were gonna be for Pete.
4248,"Don't forget Mississippi, Louisiana, etc..."
4249,"Many of the times Trump spoke, the market dropped. It‚Äôs a combination of his lack of preparation when his administration was warned by the Obama administration to prepare before Trump took over, his intel briefing about the virus in January, his lies and his downplaying of the problem when his GOP enablers was briefed on the severity of the situation while secretly communicating that severity to their rich donors and selling off their stocks, his contradiction of the experts, his lying press conferences and berating of the media, his massive turnover of experts in the White House in favor of his personal inexperienced loyalist etc."

4252,"I don't mind Clyburn heading the VP search, but, I also am uncomfortable with his comment about the primaries.   


Bernie SHOULD drop out, but, he should do it on his own accord."
4253,Thank you!
4254,That should be a wake up call. Trump supporters are more civil and willing to talk with actual democrats than your cult. Have watching comrade grandpa eat dirt for the rest of his life after his next imminent heart attack.
4255,"I was one of the new donors, originally in Pete‚Äôs camp. Pete doesn‚Äôt have a path forward any more so I‚Äôll be casting my vote for Joe on Tuesday"
4256,"Excellent.  Carbon taxes are the fastest, most economically efficient way to slash emissions with the least damage.  

They also have more bipartisan support than you'd think, making them more passable than any other proposal."
4257,"Biden had a few flubs.


I‚Äôm worried about the immigration comment about ‚ÄúOnly felons get deported...‚Äù  I mean obviously violent misdemeanors would be included in that list, too.  No?  I think it would have been better to say they‚Äôll prioritize deporting felons vs other persons.  Because he obviously doesn‚Äôt want *completely open* borders.


Just worry about the negative ads."
4258,Biden hasn‚Äôt been an independent for over a decade...???
4259,Because being a senator is so different from being president. Just totally different jobs. A governor would be more comfortable stepping in and leading.
4260,"I hate to be pedantic, but I don't think I've heard about Bernie literally flinging shit. Though I'd definitely watch it."
4261,I‚Äôm leaving this up but upvoting you because it‚Äôs important to see your comment. The polls were wrong in 2016 against HRC and they can be wrong again. We gotta push and turn out.

Warren is the real left wing of the party.  I'm ashamed that the toxic populism of Sanders drowned her out with circuitous attack on her gender.  I just wish Warren had called him out on stage like Pete did."
4275,"I don't dislike Bernie...I think he's a decent person. But he's had numerous surrogates launch extremely dirty attacks on Biden...and he's even apologized for Teachout. I've been critical of Biden on the busing issue, even though I do understand at the time the polling in support for busing among Black voters in Delaware barely broke 50% and sometimes had more negative polls. I've had family  members even say they had mixed feelings on it, and they were the ones who would have theoretically had their children benefit from it.   TLDR: It's a complicated issue, even though I think Biden was wrong. But I've seen white surrogates of Bernie call Biden a segregationist like George Wallace based on the busing issue and then scoff at Black voters for voting for him....and it's like ""hell nah, it's not even close to being on the same level."" I mean, look at Bill de blaiso...did you hear what he said about Black voters and Biden?

Frankly, Biden's surrogates could fire back but they don't (for example, the video of Bernie blaming Obama for only 10% of white Mississippians voting for Democrats was so, so insanely tone deaf or saying guns are different in Chicago than Vermont..yikes). 

So I don't get why you are upset at this very, very mild retort that some Biden supporters may use in response to people screaming Biden's corrupt and a segregationist."

4279,"I understand why you like his policies. I don't think anyone here doesn't care about supporting the broader picture too. Where Bernie loses me, is his ability to unite people; not just his own followers, but everyone. The country is already completely devided from trump's administration. If Bernie is stuggling to unite all of the left then how is he going to get republicans on his side once he's in office? Medicare for all sounds great but if the country remains divided its not going to pass congress."
4280,"How can I ""get to know joe""? Way back in February when Pete was still in the race we used to have this thing called the Pete Channel where you could find all the great videos of Pete explaining his policies and generally just good long form interviews.

4285,"There is a footnote in there that speculates why their results don't match exit-polling. 
""This is different from exit poll results, which report only 16 percent of Clinton supporters voting for McCain versus 83 percent for Obama. One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the exit poll question was asked only to Democrats and was based on whom they wanted to win the primary, not on whether they actually voted in the nomination contest. Moreover, because the question is asked after the general election, there may be over-reporting of support for the winning candidate.""

a) ""Only asked of democrats"". On the surface, I could agree with this idea, except they don't break down Clinton's support into Democrat/Republican/Independent cross-sections to support this assertion. 

b) ""Who they wanted to win, not who they voted for"". This is just pure speculation as far as I can tell.

c) ""It took place after the general election."" This is a complete mischaracterization of how exit-polling works. Surveys are taken directly after people vote, with no results available to influence who they say they voted for.

d) The more plausible answer to the discrepancy is in the sample size. Of the 1,837 people used in the sample from your source, only about 275 of them were Clinton voters. This raises red flags when they are specifically parsing that number in the study, and brush off nonrandom data points like who dropped out of the study. This is in contrast to the exit-poll, which had more than 16,000 respondents. If we assume a similar ratio as in the study for Clinton voters, that is a sample of 2400 compared to 275."

Your restraint will shine through to all the eyes reading along. 

You diplomacy and civility will illustrate the lack of diplomacy of the other side if it is missing. I believe we need to put our own egos and hurt feelings aside for the good of the country.  It's important to show grace in defeat and triumph because grace is the opposite of Trumpism."
4309,"Sure. He released his medical records and notes from doctors assuring the voters he is fit to serve as president. Joe Biden also released medical information, but it was all related to his physical health- lack alcohol/tobacco use, physical exercise, etc. Nothing about his mind, which is clearly the issue to anyone who watches him speak. I have no problems discussing sanders heart. You obviously have a problem discussing Biden‚Äôs dementia since you avoided all the instances of seriously problematic errors made on his part that have nothing to do with his ‚Äúlifelong stutter‚Äù. Try googling ‚Äújoe Biden stutter‚Äù and see if you can find anything about it before the campaign started- I couldn‚Äôt."
4310,"The problem is that this gives Bernie an excuse to stay in the race. I understand the rationale behind this decision by the gov, can't blame him.

4314,"But where has he been? I saw Bernie live-streaming with some musical guests, surely that‚Äôll fix everything about the pandemic than him being in Washington as a *sitting* Senator, unlike the man talking with party leadership right now who isn‚Äôt even holding any public office right now!

/s if it wasn‚Äôt blatantly obvious."
4315,Agreed. I was largely bored by the debate. I didn‚Äôt see anything that could change anyone‚Äôs mind.
4316,"&gt; You literally can‚Äôt win without converting Trump voters

Lol, sure you can. Trump won via a whopping 70k votes in 3 states. You literally only need to convince 70k non-voters to vote in three states and 2016 goes the other way.

&gt; numb nuts.

Embarrassing."

4318,"Some of his campaign staffers have said some of this shit though, those can‚Äôt be Russian trolls"
4319,Joe literally has plans for every single thing that Sanders says he doesn't have a plan for.
4320,2020 is not 2016. We‚Äôve already seen record turnout for Biden compared to Hillary. That‚Äôs how this election will be won in November.
4321,"It's becoming super clear that this is an ego thing for him. Same exact ""strategy"" as 2016 that dampened enthusiasm and turnout for the actual Democratic nominee when he knew he had 0% chance. So irresponsible."

4326,"I can explain. Most of these rural counties have decent hispanic and native populations. These demographics were very good for Bernie in other states. They seem to be about tied with white voters here, so above average numbers for these demographics push Bernie over the top.

The white working class rural counties voted for Biden along with the suburban-heavy ones (including King County with Seattle)."

4332,"I watched the video - he didn't refer to the neighborhood as planet of the apes but to inside of the movie theater. Which doesn't make it better I agree totally uncalled for. But right after that literally recognizes it and says that was racist I shouldn't have done that. Also, he said they were high as shit.

4334,"YOu know what is CRAZY the exit poll in Missouri. I dont have the exact numbers but most people there would trust Biden in an emergency over sanders, but most WANT medicare for all, to me this shows some of Bernies ideas resonates with voters just not Bernie himself, at least in missouri"
4335,"But if you added warrens votes to Bernie, he‚Äôd be kicking it."
4336,"It's really difficult to find anything wrong with Bernie so news organizations exaggerate everything. The worst thing wrong with him is he aims really high. He doesn't expect to get half of what he's saying through but even half of it is still better than anyone else. I hope Biden listens to him going forward and learns from what he is saying. It does appear so. 

Does anyone here know anything about Biden policy on public transportation? He road on a train most days so he must be for improving them. I just want to know if he's made any recommendations"

Just because you have not bothered to look into this because the results support what you want to see doesn't mean it's not true. Unless you have actually studied this like I have and can present the data that disproves it, you don't have any credibility in your claims.

In addition to exacerbating a pandemic, the Illinois primary had an approximately 23% decrease in voter turnout compared to 2016 -- despite turnout increasing significantly almost everywhere else. Insane on every level to have gone forward with in-person elections yesterday

Biden and Tom Perez pushed for this primary voting to go on DESPITE recommendations from the CDC and despite knowing full well that large numbers of people would rightly not come out and vote in order to protect their health. That is a prime example of ELECTION RIGGING and voter suppression. It's sick everyone should be calling for the resignation of Tom Perez."
4355,This. SO MUCH THIS! We are facing a gobal pandemic and economic disaster. Congress is working on a massive bailout for Americans. And the democratic socialist who wants to lead the nation is a no-show!?!? How the hell is Bernie not in the room driving this thing???
4356,Let's defeat Trump!
4357,If you read the article it explains why Biden is very different from Clinton electorally.
4358,"A friend of mine supports Bernie, and I just spent over two hours scraping together some proof of Bernie's toxic campaign staff, his voting/sponsoring records, his pitfalls...

I don't think I'm winning a supporter for Biden (said friend is too left and not very tuned in to the play by play of this primary), but the more I went down the research rabbit hole the more I'm thankful that Biden's the one winning and not Bernie."
4359,Is there anyway to watch it without paying for it?
4360,https://twitter.com/2020Delegates/status/1237540076294295552
4361,Unfortunately some of Bernie‚Äôs followers (and maybe his campaign even) think that the coronavirus delaying primaries gives them an opening. It is very frustrating and I hope Bernie and his campaign come to their senses but I‚Äôm not holding my breath.
4362,Top of the morning to you :)
4363,These people are dangerously delusional. They're radicalizing themselves in real-time.
4364,"[this is the most well known time Biden used ""malarkey'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXfWgiaB41A)"
4365,"How we pay for it:

Current federal, state and local government spending over the next ten years is projected to total about $30 trillion.

The revenue options Bernie has proposed total $17.5 Trillion

$30 trillion  + $17.5 trillion = $47.5 Trillion total 

The ENTIRE US budget over the next 10 years is [44 Trillion](https://www.usaspending.gov/#/)

He expects to be able to outspend the entire budget just on healthcare??? That‚Äôs insane"
4366,It adds to the tapestry of incompetence and makes it harder for him to say that he did the best he could.
4367,"Biden vs Trump this November is gonna be a race to watch, let‚Äôs go Biden!!!"
4368,"Yea as seen here, both Biden and Yang are more similar in this regard:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SkQDPxUbT8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SkQDPxUbT8) 

&amp;#x200B;

Also I don't think that just because you're now Biden supporter, you're no longer YangGang. I think both can co-exist simultaneously. :)"
4369,Biden said his vo has to agree with him on healthcare policy too in the article.
4370,"Biden may not win Alabama in general, but a strong showing would help down the ballot candidates and just maybe get Jones re-elected among split voters.

It will be really hard but not impossible."
4371,I‚Äôm worried about voter turnout going back down because of the Coronavirus to be honest.
4372,I literally don't know a single person who is like that outwardly. It seems to be a vocal minority hiding behind anonymity.
4373,Bernie really should just drop out then.
4374,"My dream pick? Michelle. Obama, that is. 

Now if I‚Äôm being for real? Elizabeth Warren. Kamala is okay, but I don‚Äôt relish the idea of that debate clip being played over and over and over again. Plus, she doesn‚Äôt add much. California will go Democrat regardless, and so will the African American vote. I would dig a Harris/Pence debate, though. No doubt about that. 

Elizabeth, OTOH, will pick up progressives who might be smartin‚Äô from Bernie‚Äôs loss. I think she adds something to the ticket. The question is whether they think they can take another septuagenarian on the ticket. But Elizabeth looks terrific, is really energetic and is ‚Äúonly‚Äù 70, so I think she‚Äôs probably good. And though it means nothing, I really like her."
4375,"Thank you. As a former Pete supporter who literally cried when Pete dropped out, this makes me confident that I am making the right choice by going all in on Biden.

Look, we're all close enough on policy preferences. The real part that matters is supporting a candidate who will be a true leader and unifier that has a heart and is going to do everything in his power to accomplish what is right and just. Joe is clearly that person.

4379,Putin must have offered that role to someone else already *sideways glances at Jill Stein*
4380,Probably not as bad as HRC since Diamond is a more likable person
4381,"But by then isn‚Äôt the damage already done? I mean, looking at the polls (and being more realistic about where Bloomberg people would land) it seems like having those delegates would almost secure Biden the nomination. 

I‚Äôm not buying that a bunch of Bloomberg people have sanders as second, btw. The people in my area who are bloombergers are very rich and would vote trump over Bernie in a heartbeat. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong but I just don‚Äôt see a crossover."
4382,"Same. Bernie is a flawed messenger with generally populist policy ideas. Biden has a lot of flawed votes and other issues. Dems have squandered much of the energy from the post-2016 women‚Äôs movement. 

Trump‚Äôs approval rating seems to be inching upward as he continues to be an idiot about Coronavirus. That worries me. Bush‚Äôs approval shot up 90% after 9/11. I think Trump‚Äôs ceiling is much lower, but still."
4383,I might be misreading it but it sounds like there‚Äôs a penalty if they vote after June 8th but not if they do so before. And the Democratic Party is working with states to make it work.
4384,"They're brainwashed, low-information voters, didn't you know?"
4385,Shocked if Joe does not go to the other gender
4386,"Well, I guess I think it's more ""revisionist"" to apply today's concept of ""progressive"" to the 1994 political landscape.     In 1994, it was seen as a lefty bill...it's today, with our knowledge about the terrible repercussions of mass incarceration, that we see it through a different lens.   

But, I think we are differing over semantic political classifications that are subjective and shift over time, not the overall concept, which is that the 1994 Crime Bill was a creature of its time, and not proof that those who supported it were deliberately planning for the negatives that resulted."

1. Universal healthcare through a public option, as well as the standard Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies, ending out-of-network surprise billing, require states that refused the ACA Medicaid expansion to allow eligible people to enroll in the public option (insuring some 5 million people overnight).
2. Decriminalization of marijuana, no incarceration for drug possession, vacating current nonviolent drug offenders' convictions, banning of private prisons
3. $15 minimum wage and indexing it for the future
4. Reinstating DACA and creating a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants
5. Overturn Citizens United and go even farther with a constitutional amendment
6. Increase income taxes on the rich to expand social security benefits and maintain solvency
7. Increase taxes on corporations to pay for a tax credit to cap all rent at 30% of income and a $15,000 tax credit for the purchase of a first home
8. 100% clean energy by 2050 with investment in nuclear power and a carbon tax to fund renewables
9. Ban the sale of assault weapons, universal background checks
10. All companies must provide at least 12 weeks paid family leave
11. Universal community college, expand PSLF, double Pell grants, and reduce interest on repayment plans.

And the big key is that he has both support in Congress for his policies &amp; working relationships to get it done.

He just won big in some of the most important general election swing states (MN, NC, VA, TX). He polls ahead of Trump in other important swing states like Florida, Pennsylvania, and Georgia.

With your help, Joe Biden will win the 2020 election, and he'll carry coattails to help Democrats expand their House majority, regain the Senate, and take back state houses and Governor's mansions all around the country. And then he'll get to work passing surprisingly progressive legislation that will massively benefit working and middle class Americans, healing and uniting our country, and leading us out of the dark, divisive times of the past four years."
4399,Has Jimmy Dore and TYT made a video about how him getting emotional proves he had dementia?
4400,"Frankly, if Sanders gets trounced on the 10th and 17th, which is looking likely, I hope he drops out, and I say that as a foreigner who supports him. The party does not need another bitter convention, or even more bitter young social democrats who won't vote for Biden. A united party can easily beat Trump, but a fractured one may lead to another narrow loss."

4403,"Trump doesn‚Äôt understand nuance.  His nicknames are either based on appearance, like Little Mike, or else they rhyme, like Shifty Schiff.

4404,"Much respect to Tom Steyer. Thank you for serving the cause of progress, sir, keep up the good work! TEAM DEMOCRAT = TEAM PROGRESS!"
4405,"I understand and respect this is the Biden sub, but as a Warren supporter I genuinely feel like she was the best person to be president. My heart is just shattered because god, what an incredible human being. Just such an intelligent, collected and passionate woman. It feels like Donald Trump is controlling the Democratic Party in a sense because we focused more on who could beat Trump rather than who could best tackle the needs of our hurting nation.

But I‚Äôm supporting Biden going forward. I already voted for Liz and will cherish that for a long time. But I hope he brings her on as VP as a way to bridge the divide between progressives and moderates. I think that‚Äôs the biggest challenge we face now going forward.

Thanks for being good people and not poaching. We feel a bit in limbo and kinda homeless, but many people on Twitter recognize Bernie is a sinking ship. He should never have run this election - i could only dream of Warren and Biden being the final two in this race.

But forward we go! Persist! Dream big, fight hard America."

4420,"What is the TYT connection? I think I watched one TYT episode and was the one where Cenk Uygur was defending Asia Argento. Not exactly my favorite media outlet.

Having a Democratic trifecta is paramount. I am not opposed to this at all and I know all the policies Biden supports. I never said he didn't support a 15 dollar minimum wage or other liberal reforms like that, I don't think many candidates can get elected as a dem without at least some. My problem with Biden is that, okay, let's go to your point about AOC. It is entirely possible and even plausible that Bernie Sanders campaign policies will have to be compromised to be enacted. That just tends to happen in politics whatever. Is there a reason that can't happen with Biden? Wouldn't negotiation start better with the most progressive possible starting point? Obama had to compromise on a ton of his points and his platform was even more centrist than Biden's current one.

I think his policies are untenable anyways. Public option for healthcare? What are rural Americans without local specialists in-network supposed to do? Walk to the doctor? And for the free college thing, guess how many poor teenagers don't exactly have access to their parents tax paperwork. In fact, what happens to the kids who are estranged from their parents and can't even complete the means test? This isn't even a hypothetical, this is why I can't go to college yet; I can't do the FAFSA.

I never said Joe Biden is a Republican. Really, he's certainly better than Trump. It's hard for me, though, to justify voting for a candidate that's so far off from what I feel is necessary just because he's up against someone worse. To go back to your main point though, I'll ask this. Biden refused to say that he wouldn't veto M4A should it pass through congress. Is there something I can grab on to suggest that otherwise, he'd pass through and not compromise on other pieces of the progressive agenda?

Thanks for hearing me out here. I'm sorry if I come off as hostile or unreasonable this is just a big hurdle for me. Also sorry for the late reply I'm on my lunch break at work lol."

Let me help you

&gt;Socialism is about private ownership of productive assets, factories, land, offices, raw materials-- not personal property.

&gt;Communist philosophy argues against private property and supports collective ownership. This philosophy applies specifically to intellectual property and software. The common view is that no person should on their own or control any property, whether electronic, merely an idea, or otherwise."

And Joe could have graciously let him have more say behind closed doors regarding the platform.


The only thing that will come out of the debate is that Bernie Bros will continue to feel like ‚Äúthe establishment‚Äù is out to get them and that Joe is the enemy of progress.  Bernie doesn‚Äôt control his most vocal surrogates/supporters.  He can give a big hearty endorsement to Joe next Tuesday, but he‚Äôs already given a signal tens of thousands of his supporters that ‚Äúyou need to resist Joe Biden and the DNC‚Äù.  They‚Äôll pick up on that whistle just as easily as Joe‚Äôs endorsements from Pete, Amy, and Beto did for moderates the day before Super Tuesday.


This is all about Bernie‚Äôs ego.  Part of him wants Trump to win just so he can come back in 2024 and say ‚ÄúYou should have joined the revolution...that‚Äôs why Democrats can‚Äôt beat Republicans...‚Äù. Never mind that Democrats don‚Äôt have their own egotistical Vermont Senator subtlety knifing their presidential nominee in the back every four years until it‚Äôs no longer convenient for him.  Then when that candidate bleeds out before the general election, they have the gall to ask Democrats why they didn‚Äôt choose a stronger candidate."

4439,You're literally complaining about one dude on a different subreddit. ROTR dude.

4454,"Let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm afraid to voice my disapproval of Bernie because his supporters are just so bratty and vicious. I feel that they‚Äôre making the same mistakes of 2016, assuming that every democrat swings left and left flabbergasted if Bernie loses. They‚Äôre alienating a lot of moderate democrats who are usually older and more likely to vote than the younger crowd."

4457,"Exactly. This wasn't timed to do maximum harm to Biden, it was timed because Bernie's camp is absolutely desperate and they're out of time.

4476,"I replied to you because you said dumb shit. Bernie lies all the damn time about other candidates and his own policies. I feel the same way about Bernie as you do Clinton. I read more and listened to Bernie more and realised I can‚Äôt stand the man. No, Biden isn‚Äôt the best and I don‚Äôt support everything he‚Äôs done.

4482,"It's difficult. I just watched Biden misrepresent Sanders' words about China in the debate, watched Biden make up the idea that Sanders takes money from nine super PACS, watched him deny taking stances that he has been documented as taking in the past. It seems to all be more evidence of a core belief system that values winning over providing value for other people. For me, that makes this decision very difficult.

I want to support whoever is running against Trump, and I despite all of this, I may yet. I don't know. But for me, personally, Biden makes it so hard for me to support him at every turn."

Now, he's faced with a real crisis.  We elect a President to guide us through dark times like this, and we've got this evil clown in charge, more interested in his own image than the lives of millions of Americans.

Trump is completely unsuited for public office, and enough fools voted for him that he squeaked by to become President with a -3 million vote mandate.  Now we have the worst Pandemic in a century, and people are going to die from his incompetence."

4489,"Could not agree more. Hillary was a great candidate. For her age and health she campaigned with an amazing amount of energy. Her love for the country cannot be questioned after she served one of the most dangerous, exhausting, responsible and difficult offices in the entire government under a candidate that had beaten her to presidency. Especially given that she is still engaged even though she has nothing to gain and only more to lose  as the propaganda from both parties (very unfortunately) keeps firing on her whenever her name is brought up. 

I remember a ""progressive"" channel, strong supporter of Bernie even though the guy does not seem to understand what Bernie's about at all, running a full video filled with smears, titled something along the lines ""Hillary wants to ruin another election"". What was the video essentially about? About Hillary being asked by someone if she  wanted to run again, and she answered no. And thats the video that a LEFT-winged channel went on a 10-minutes long rant about. This is the level of violence Hillary had to face from both sides especially after defeating Bernie. Her biggest flaw was that her last name is Clinton, and that there are people on the left guilible enough to run republican propaganda and talking points for them."
4490,Looking good for the general!
4491,"He flat out said he wants someone who is the same as him ideologically.

I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the specific reason but that‚Äôs definitely one I‚Äôve heard before.
4495,"&gt;Charles Chamberlain, chairman of the political action committee Democracy for America, said there is a ‚Äúreal question‚Äù about whether either Biden or Sanders can reach the delegate threshold necessary to secure the nomination outright and that the tumultuous nature of the race suggests Sanders should stay in.

&gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone can predict for sure what‚Äôs going to happen between now and the end of this primary contest,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs plenty of time, plenty of delegates left, and this game can change at any minute.‚Äù The Democratic Party, he said, ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt be about shutting it down‚Äù before more states vote.

4502,"Only a matter of time. Pete is good people. I believe we're going to see Democratic unity long before the convention and it will be powerful. People who drink the koolaid say Joe is passive, What they don't get is Biden is the anti-Drumpf, he is power and strength without bluster. What a sad world we live in that so many Americans believe *might is right*. 

Joe and friends 2020!!"
4503,I think there will definitely be an establishment strikes back attempt after Trump. Whether that is successful or not who knows.
4504,"Counterpoint 1: Candidates are meant to be most responsive to the majority of voters. In this case this means that Joe's primary responsibility is to maintain the policies that his voters voted for (if we are assuming that our voters are ideal and voted based on policy and not extraneous factors). Joe has no responsibility to move/shift positions to satisfy Bernie or his constituents since they did not vote for him. Therefore, since there is no reason for Joe to change his position since it is popular based on vote count (again, assuming ideal voter) then Bernie should have no reason to stay in the race in an attempt to move Biden. Biden moves in response to his supporters (ideally) not in response to the political goals of another candidate. This isn't to say that it can't happen but the point is that it doesn't require Bernie for it to happen in any way. If Biden wants to court Bernie's supporters then he'll make that strategic decision, Bernie doesn't factor in.

Counterpoint 2: No one is citing reddit commenters. This is true. However, the issue is that they are sharing and disseminating misinformation that is ultimately harmful to our democracy. It is the responsibility of those within any political organization to self-police and manage the spread of misinformation by calling out bad actors. This includes any Biden-knights who try to push any conspiracies regarding Bernie. Remember, misinformation is a powerful tool as both Russia and China have demonstrated and intentional/unintentional coordination of misinformation can cause significant doubts among voters (see Hillary emails)."
4505,"It's not that hard. Have you thought of the people in which you affect change?

A vast array of people are constantly moving and changing, not only dealing with political matters,, but vast social, economic and health reforms.

And while I love each new supporters as my brothers and sisters in arms, we simply cannot afford to repeat the base message, trying, begging, comforting and handling all the new people with those changes.

Biden's a good guy with good plans, all of them are easy to access by the main web page.

Bernie is also good guy, but we can't wine, romance and show affection to each person thats switching over.

Thats all the sub would be 24/7.

Is trying to explain, trying to romance and working with each new supporter impossible? Yes, yes it is.

In fact it gets so bad some times we've gotta lock and delete these posts because of volume and numbers.

I've read the threads, all of them. People have been kind and helpful, yet you keep getting snippy with them. 

So save the snip, read the website basics, do a bit of real research and be friendly."

4512,It‚Äôs Ohio. Science is in Genesis Chapter 1.
4513,"First, you‚Äôre going to have to understand that the majority of the attacks on him are bullshit. If you can‚Äôt be open to that then stop here.

He is a good, decent man who has been through personal tragedy like many average Americans. He helped Barack Obama be a great success, which was monumentally important as the first black president. When they passed the ACA in 2010 and he was caught on a hot mic saying ‚Äúthis is a big fucking deal‚Äù you can feel the genuine passion he has for his fellow man. He forced Obama‚Äôs hand on gay marriage to the point where he floated the idea of replacing him with Hillary. He wants tangible, progressive change that he 100% can get done with a solid blue down ballot wave. Gun control, expand Obamacare, climate change, etc. I love him for his compassion."
4514,"Well Bernie would have to want it A) and B) Biden would need to trust he would not undermine him. I do hope there is a way to find unity with his camp, but I don't think he will be in the cabinet."
4515,He doesn't own her either.
4516,"No.

He is a Senator without fear.  Utah will support him as a Romney and a high ranking member of the LDS church.  As a result, he is voting and acting his conscience.

He has also known Joe for years, and identifies strongly with decent people."
4517,No one has ever made a come ball that large in American politics. Bernie is trying to shift Biden left and have more of his supporters support Biden.
4518,"&gt; I'm guessing in one of the places exclusively trying to target Joe with propaganda some new allegation had popped up that was so ridiculous not even controversy-hungry media picked it up?

4529,"Bernie didn't help his case for another debate by literally smearing, flinging shit, rejecting calls for unity and telling lies about Biden's record in the last debate. Had Bernie approached the last debate with some form of decency, and had respectfully disagreed with Joe whilst making a broader case for Progressive ideas and keeping focus on Trump, there likely would have been another debate."
4530,Public option? Reduced drug costs? Sounds pretty compassionate to me.
4531,"Trust me, when it comes down to 'moving on from VP obsession', I am one of the first who went through the 5 steps of the grief and doesn't care much about the VP.

I fundamentally supported Pete, not because I want to glorify his goal of becoming president, but the values he would enact as a president. (Which is one of the reasons why I didn't have any problem supporting Biden when Pete officially endorsed Biden...as Uncle Joe shares that value of making America 'generous' again. (Yes, I am plugging Obama's 2004 speech into this) )


What I am trying to say is:

A lot of the Pete folks have accepted Pete not becoming VP, because of RACIAL representation matters as much as gender representation in this time of the American society.  And, they also accepted the fact that Pete being pictured as 'another white guy' throughout this primary, despite his sexual orientation is a real hurdle for Pete for VP contest...and kinda bargained &amp; accepted it.

But, picking Amy........is a huge middle finger flip for a lot of those folks.

Not saying that's good, bad, justified or not.  That's just how it is."
4532,"Former Pete guy here.


One thing that has surprised me is that I'm actually super pumped to vote for Biden tomorrow. Especially after the SC primary, things seem abuzz with optimism now that the primary is shifting to the right track imo. The whole Reddit view of Biden being ""boring"" or ""uninspiring"" is just incorrect. Reddit is not real life - those South Carolina voters were enthusiastic."
4533,But do you really want politicians to use religion as a marketing tool. Tbh I cringe whenever they say that their policy is inspired by god and thus say that they are better because they think they are more spiritually connected.

Yes, he Biden running away in the primaries, and yes every reputable poll places Biden a wider margin ahead of Trump, and yes in order for Bernie to beat Trump he would have to raise the youth vote an unrealistic percentage, and yes Bernie would also have to win states like Pennsylvania and Florida where he polls substantially low, and yes Bernie would have to convince moderate conservatives to switch over, despite over 70% strongly disagree with socialism.

I'm insulted that my progressive *bone fides* are always called into question by sneering Bernie supporters.

4571,"Bernie‚Äôs strange adoration for Fidel Castro is problematic for some Hispanics - Fidel killed 140,000 people and caused 2 million to flee their homes. Bernie found a bright spot in that. 

Put a positive spin on Fidel Castro - wonder why some Hispanics don‚Äôt like him."
4572,"There are lots of reasons we won't get a repeat of 2016.  The media is savvier.  Joe is open and likeable.  Burisma is about Hunter Biden, who will not be on the ticket.  Trump has a record now and can no longer be an empty vessel for whatever people want him to be.

But one of the things I like about Biden as a candidate is that his unfiltered gaffiness seems to creates a media-scrambling effect, not unlike Trump's unfiltered evil.  They'll be running on equal footing.

Biden's polling has been consistently great against Trump over the last year or so.  There's  a reason Trump got his pallid ass impeached sending Rudy and Ukraine to take down Biden of all the candidates: fear.

We got this."
4573,"I agree that one step back is better than 20. And yes, I‚Äôll end up having to vote for Biden out of necessity. I‚Äôm in my 30s. This crap keeps happening over and over again. My generation and the ones after me will have to suffer for these inane decisions. But at least the older generations will die with their money and that free healthcare that they don‚Äôt believe everyone else deserves. I may be cynical, but I‚Äôm quite justified in my cynicism."
4574,"I think people are realizing how dangerous 4 more years of Trump can be.

We are also seeing why Trump was willing to risk impeachment to tarnish Biden. He is crushing it in swing states and red/purple states. Bernie in 2016 was a phenomenon of people voting against the prospect of another 8 yrs of a Clinton or Bush."
4575,..care to elaborate?
4576,"I was yuge for Bernie in 2016, and this year I was all in for Pete starting about a year ago. 


If Bernie had explained to me, with evidence, why M4A is better than a public option, why his implementation would be better, why it would he smarter from a fiscal perspective, or anything like that I would have listened. The problem is that his plan is overly simplified in it's current state, it doesnt line up with what other countries have seen be successful,  and he feels no obligation to explain how it nor any of his plans will be paid for. 



That lack of explanation and intellectual dishonesty with voters is what turned me off to him and drove me to Pete. Then Pete drops out, would make sense that I go back to my preference from last time, right? Wrong. 


Instead of focusing on policy differences, Bernie decides to be petty and attack out in the open fundraising while collaborating with a dark money group in Our Revoltion.  He puffs his chest and claims to be more pure than everyone, while not answering the substantive questions posed to him. His supporters lash out with vitriol and hate online, and it bleeds into real life far too often in the case of how they attacked Pete. They acted like awful people, ugly on the inside and misinformed. They acted like Trump supporters. 



Bernie could have had my vote back, and part of me is sad that he won't, but running a one-note campaign fueled by pettiness, misinformation, and toxic rhetoric is not going to win you any friends or influence people. 



Never in a million years did I think I'd be in the diamond Joe gang, but here I fucking am."
4577,IT'S HAPPENING!
4578,"Yeah, there‚Äôs a big difference between ‚Äúanyone but x‚Äù during the primaries and the general.  Vote your conscience in the primary.  Vote smart in November.

I honestly feel bad that you Zoomers don‚Äôt see Hillary the same way I do.  I‚Äôm 28, so my earliest memories of her were in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.  It was a no win for her.  Either she stayed with Bill and got flack for it, or she divorced him and got flack for abandoning her marriage and raising Chelsea in a broken home.  Things were different in the 90s.  Women who got divorced weren‚Äôt seen as being strong and independent.  They were scorned for not sticking it out for their children.  I watched the same thing happen with my parents‚Äô friends and my friends‚Äô parents.  Hell, my own parents did a trial separation, and my mom got all the flack when it was my dad‚Äôs decision.

So Hillary stuck it out while Bill was still in office.  And Faux News was threatened by her.  She wasn‚Äôt an arm candy First Lady hosting dinners for foreign dignitaries.  She was active with her own causes.  Then she didn‚Äôt allow Bill‚Äôs scandal to stop her from her own political career.  They‚Äôve been trying to bring her down for years with the same arguments that she‚Äôs arrogant and hawkish.  It started with Fox and the Republicans and was picked up by the Bernie Bros.

Notice that they used a lot of the same tactics on Kamala, Gillibrand, Klobuchar, and Warren.  And none of them got as far as Hillary did.  So I think it actually has less to do with her and more that Republicans and even Bernie will do anything to prevent a woman from becoming president.  Boomer politicians really need to die off or retire.  After Biden wins, obviously."
4579,"The orange dumbass was bragging the other day about the largest gain in history, now he has two of the largest drops and crickets.  Fucking hell get this orange sack of shit out of the office in November and let the criminal prosecutions begin."
4580,"Ha Joe barely outrunning death, it's just like that."
4581,I'm in agreement with you.
4582,I hate how people act like the judiciary is wonderful when in reality it is often a very political and very harmful organization.
4583,John Kasich is awesome tho
4584,"8% of democrats overall say they won't vote for Biden if he's the nominee.  It was above 11% for Hillary.
Moderate Moderate is a winning ticket if the moderates are good speakers, likable and authentic.  Most people don't care about economic policy, they care about what the person looks and sounds like."
4585,No. Would alienate a lot of Democrats.
4586,"Most conspiracy theories involve the secretive group being strong and weak at the same time.  Like the one about Clinton faking millions of votes in California, instead of using them to actually win the election."
4587,You really did it bro I‚Äôm so proud
4588,"Seriously, Bern boy is going to have a trophy sent to him by the FEC after they get staffed again by an administration that cares about finance fraud.  The sheer number of complaints that they have sent him is insane."

4594,"Because it's not threatening, harassing, or bullying anyone."
4595,"If you have seen the light and want to stop Trump the best thing to do would be to vote blue in November, but at least you won‚Äôt be voting Trump."
4596,"Bernie's attacks on Biden is for the purpose of luring Democrats to vote for him. These attacks may potentially cause division within the party

A divided Democratic Party basically hands Trump the presidency. Its exactly why, now more than ever, Democrats need to get in line and unite."
4597,They‚Äôre in their own bubble.
4598,Roughly $10M but it‚Äôs all going to their staffers salaries and benefits so they have resources to look for new work for about a month
4599,"Honestly, I've always been a moderate. I was proud of my very conservative wife walking into early voting staffed by her friends and asking for a Democratic ballot."
4600,If it somehow caught on at a national level I would feel so accomplished lol
4601,"Lol..this is stupid, black people love joe for doing what he was supposed to do as vice president. Yall set the bar low."
4602,"It's like Bernie read ""Lord of the Flies"" and said, YES. 


He really needs to hire Pete to give him a plan for his revolution."
4603,"Yes, the totally organic and not at all manufactured by the bernie campaign ""Where did Joe go"" question.  I wonder what the next totally organic and not at all manufactured attack will be now that this one looks silly."
4604,Very solid analysis of the issues. I hope you will find a good group of folks here. Let's win this thing.
4605,i dont think bloomberg would even want it hed have to sell his business just to be vp
4606,"Yeah, if only there were someone who had similar talking points and policies, but also had a vision of unity for party and country.

-signed, a disgruntled former Warren supporter who is now all in for Biden"
4607,So glad I decided to early vote for Joe in FL last week. Need to convince my husband to go when he gets off of work.
4608,"Bloomberg did bring it up, but when Bernie pointed out that he said the same things about Castro that Obama said (if you watch the videos, Obama was more generous towards Castro), Biden chimed in that Obama never praised an authoritarian like Bernie did. 

Why can't he just let the man defend himself? It's just disrespectful to the Americans who want healthcare and education reform to push that dialogue that will ensure that only marginal victories will ever be possible.  As a democrat he shouldn't he be trying to point out how humane and sensible those ideas are? Instead he is using the idea that Bernie is radical to help the moderate portion at the expense of the progressive portion."
4609,"Alan Gross was imprisoned for being a CIA spy. As per his [Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Gross?wprov=sfla1),

&gt;However, he went to Cuba for a fifth time in late November 2009 and was arrested 11 days later.¬†When he was arrested, he was carrying a high-tech chip,¬†intended to keep satellite phone transmissions from being located within¬†250 miles (400 kilometres). The chip is not available on the open market. It is provided most frequently to the CIA and the¬†United States Department of Defense, but can also be obtained by the¬†United States Department of State, which oversees USAID.

This is literally an endorsement from the CIA."
4610,"It's a Bernie supporter talking point that has literally no grounding in reality.

Biden does better against Trump in matchup polls than Bernie on average

Biden crushes Bernie in swing states like FL, MI, PA

Biden as a more moderate candidate is better able to appeal to independents and disgruntled Republicans that a socialist."
4611,"No 1 here thinks joe Biden is perfect. And he‚Äôs definitely made mistakes. Buts he‚Äôs always done what he, and the state of Delaware, believed to be best. And since he was the always poorest man in congress his entire congressional career,(yes even poorer than Bernie) he didn‚Äôt do it for personal enrichment. 

Here are some things he also did that a certain group of people don‚Äôt like to think about. 


-sponsored the first climate bill in 1987 back when almost no1 recognized it as an issue

 -fought for gun control and against an out of control NRA(the same nra that helped Bernie get elected to Congress)

-landmark legislation in the violence against women act, significantly increasing recourse for women who were the victim of domestic abuse and sexual assault.

-helped lead the defeat of anti abortion activist judge Bork in the senate 


He isn‚Äôt perfect. But neither is Bernie. Right now perfect isn‚Äôt what we need."
4612,"... Lose? Sorry, I'm not here to brigade or anything‚ÄîI'm subbed to this sub because I'm open to the likely possibility of Biden winning the nomination and I feel I should familiarize myself with his policy as a result‚Äîbut that didn't feel like a win. It wasn't the smackdown Bernie's supporters wanted, not by any means, but it didn't feel like a win for either side. Biden came across as reasonable, if a little sleazy at times, and Bernie came across as Bernie does: revolutionary and angry (though he did seem to try to tone that done a bit). I support Bernie, but I acknowledge that he won't be the nominee barring some extraordinary circumstances. I'll support Biden very, very reluctantly in a general election. Regardless of my position, though, I think calling that debate for anyone would be an extreme call."
4613,Also its bs because cortez cant be vp. Shes only 30. You have to be 35 just like for president.
4614,Read the article and this is good new for joe. Alot of people live in the suburbanties and they will now support joe because they see how he works for americans. Do you support Biden?
4615,He refused to call the other witnesses. That is a fact. Clarence Thomas (a conservative) is on the supreme court today in part because Joe Biden either didn't believe women or didn't care about them getting sexually harassed. You can't pretend that isn't true.
4616,"the reason not to pick Pete is that he can't deliver a state in the general. Pete is good but he doesn't have the pull like Amy did in MN and he is a man.  Amy from MN, Tammy Baldwin WI  would be good options."
4617,Zuckerberg is a real shitstain on society.
4618,"Bernie or Bust is a very bizarre movement. I don't think they are Trump supporters, but its scary how little attention they pay to him. It's like they dont think general election will even happen. All they will say on Trump is ""Bernie is the only one who can beat Trump"", and then move on to speak in great detail on Joe Biden (previously on all candidates other than Bernie) in a way that is indeed similar to Trump supporters, a lot of times they share talking points just like Trump shared his talking points against Hillary with this movement in  2016.

What's more troubling is that Trump acknowledges the existance and power of this movement by a) avoiding critisizing Bernie, as Bernie was disproportionally ""spared"" from Trumps usual remarks on every single Democratic candidate except for him, Trump focused a lot of times on speaking of every single other major candidate, mayor Pete, Elisabeth Warren, Bloomberg, obviously Biden; b) actually trying to ALLIGN himself with theories produced by Bernie or Bust movement, pretending he cares about Bernie being ""robbed by DNC"", ""cheated once again"", he literally tweeted out these things just like he tweeted them out in 2016 and just like in between of 2016 and 2020 he kept talking about it. 

There is a reason, Trump sees potential in Bernie or Bust movement. It helped him in 2016 and he wants it to help him in 2020 and we see it in his pattern of behavior towards Bernie despite the fact Bernie is his worst ideological enemy being the most ""leftist"" major candidate. 

I know the majority of Bernie supporters are not a part of this movement. Genuine Bernie supporters will never have to be asked to support Joe once he wins, they will do it without hesitation. So i only speak to the Bernie or Bust people, i know you are on this subreddit as i have seen your messages before they were deleted by the moderators for violating the rules; you should know Trump is playing you, and if he is reelected all of Bernie's principles will be in jeopardy. Your dream will not happen, but your nightmare will. If you're treating this seriously, i'm not asking you to get behind Joe immediately but please refrain from attacking him, you are only giving Trump more and more assets. If you are genuine in your support of Bernie and his values, we dont even disagree on what needs to be done but rather in what way and on which pace, so why wage a war amongst ourselves that will help our enemy?"
4619,This. He would literally just be airing anti-Donald Trump stuff all the time. It would free up the campaign to talk about positive Joe stuff.
4620,"Did you read the quote from the Soviet constitution earlier? Nothing was to be published before oversight by state censors.

Also take a look at this from the Soviet constitution 

ARTICLE 126. In conformity with the interests of the working people, and in order to develop the organizational initiative and political activity of the masses of the people, citizens of the U.S.S.R. are ensured the right to unite in public organizations - trade unions, cooperative associations, youth organizations, sport and defence organizations, cultural, technical and scientific societies; and the most active and politically most conscious citizens in the ranks of the working class and other sections of the working people unite in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), which is the vanguard of the working people in their struggle to strengthen and develop the socialist system and is the leading core of all organizations of the working people, both public and state.

People were unable to join any group in civil society not sponsored by the communist party."
4621,And NO I am not voting Trump.
4622,"Even if the allegations are bullshit, it‚Äôs still a bad PR move IMO.  It‚Äôs hard to promise a return to decency when your VP choice has numerous mistreatment allegations against her."
4623,"Biden has been trying to hit Sanders on his legislative record during the debates but the moderators always fuck it up and flip to someone else instead of forcing Sanders to respond.

Like he brought up the 5 votes against the Brady Bill thing in like 4 straight debates and it wasn't until the last one that they actually made Sanders answer it and his answer was godawful and got boos.

He does the same thing in Sanders' terrible immigration record too and I have yet to see them force Sanders to answer.

He's been taking some shots on twitter etc as well"
4624,Quit trolling. Anybody who can compare Trump's middle-school-bully vocabulary level to Biden's can tell the difference.

4627,"Different folks use different strategies. I lose all short term memory of a conversation if I'm interrupted in the middle for more than a couple of seconds due to an illness that affects my brain , I also can't word find very well and often THINK I've got the right word when it's actually a slightly inappropriate (potentially offensive to the person I'm talking to) *almost* synonym. 

Some folks with my condition just do long pauses or talk super slowly and slur. Some use very short sentences and act a bit terse in order to keep things concise. 

I institute small pauses and lengthen the end of words to buy myself time to queue up my next phrase. 

Biden has spoken before about different techniques to address a stutter and obviously there must be then different presentations from folks with the condition because they have learnt different strategies"

I voted on tuesday and have outgrown a lot of social and political immaturity.

Edit: generally, but also specifically, to us white middle class young men who can afford to ignore it all."
4629,"&gt;The Toss Ups are: Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nebraska‚Äôs 2nd district.

I don't know why it is that Bernie supporters ardently think he'll beat Trump in a general if these are the toss ups. It's like they completely forgot we have the electoral college when they link these national head to head polls against Trump, who leads Bernie in most of those states."
4630,The CNN town hall starts soon so this post will be temporarily unstickied.
4631,Thank you. I'll give this a watch as well.
4632,"Thank you for saying it. The clips \*looked\* effective, especially when everybody seemed intent on pushing them - I watched a much longer recent CNN Town Hall video just to figure stuff out for myself. (I did.)"
4633,"I get it, you're upset about Bernie. Joe actually gets people to vote though so you should be happy about having someone who can beat Trump"
4634,Need to attack the Trumplings.  Eye for an eye.  The Trumps are paper tigers and the best defense is a good offense.
4635,"I respectfully doubt that, given the fact that the average Dem has a higher level of education. If you have a source for that claim, though, I'd love to see it! Republicans have plenty of other things they vote for."
4636,"But Joe's from Pennsylvania. I'm not worried about PA, I'm worried about WI."
4637,"Partly so it doesn‚Äôt look like he was forced out, fueling the conspiracy theories. After Biden is over 50% of the way to a majority, then the calls will likely ramp up"
4638,"It's going to take days to know, Michigan isn't really ready to handle our new absence ballot laws."
4639,"Such as that they have free markets, low corporate tax rates, and aren't socialist?"
4640,"Because it's not a tie, we lost, and unless there's a miracle turnaround, the phase we're in is the slow march until the end. Based on the polling and every statistical and betting aggregate, Biden's lead is only going to expand. On Tuesday, Bernie could win every state except Mississippi and still end up further behind on delegates. After that, Florida votes, and there's a chance he doesn't crack 25% there.

I'd rather focus on retooling the progressive movement for the future, electing the most progressive congress possible, and beating Trump, than drag out a losing primary fight as long as possible."
4641,This is so beautifully-written!
4642,"I agree with alot of what you say. Just as a side note though the ACA was a single vote shy of having a public option. A single Democratic senator, I forget his name, torpedoed that clause. I will never not be sad about it.

But I've been posing the question all night, in an era where outsiders have won the presidency for over a decade and promised to reform 'the establishment' how can Biden hope to compete? I dont believe that the amount of people afraid of progressives and socialists outnumber those that distrust lifelong politicians.

Those early polls don't tell the future. But the polls weren't just about theoretical campaigns vs trump. They showed that moderates were willing to vote for a socialist progressive more than Biden. I feel like it's just a self-fulfilling prophecy - ""Nobody would vote for a socialist therefore I won't"" The data has shown differently.

 I just hate the idea of playing it safe forever. At a certain point we will have to test all these 'commen sense' beliefs to make actual change happen."
4643,"I also feel like the media is starting to catch on to the whole ""delegates is all that matters"" thing. So even if Bernie wins Michigan (a must win for him) it will be close and he'll barely get any NET delegates. At the same time, Biden is gonna destroy Mississippi and get more delegates. So I honestly think no matter what happens, Bernie isn't gonna have the media on his side."
4644,"Meh, I'm here till I get banned."

4646,"To be fair I doubt it was her policy that cost Hillary the election. Many people just didn't like it trust her, unfortunately"
4647,"As someone who was all in on Sanders in 2016- it‚Äôs really sad to see his attack ads and refusal to drop for the betterment of the country. 

My biggest moment when I went from just not supporting Sanders to not liking him was when he openly admitted he didn‚Äôt even TRY to get Clyburn‚Äôs endorsement. There was a two week span when Bernie was objectively the front runner and all the major news networks were calling him the front runner..... yet he never pivoted to welcome in the rest of the party... he just doubled down on his positions. Clyburn completely changed the race- and Sanders supporters should be enraged at how their guy DID NOT EVEN TRY. 

A president is meant to unify- *or at least try to unify*

The other negative moment when he snapped on a reporter recently about COVID when he said he‚Äôs dealing with a crisis. Well a president needs to often deal with multiple crises while keeping a level head... and Bernie doesn‚Äôt show that he can do that."
4648,"I live in Grand Forks, and I hate to say it but your right. Also there were some districts in ND that went Biden"
4649,"I disagree with you, but it‚Äôs out of my control! I‚Äôll be supportive of whoever he chooses ! :)"
4650,"Of course. 

1: The American political system does not lend itself to large structural change. Check out how a bill becomes a law and then the breakdown of Republicans/Democrats in the House and Senate. Considering it took a minor miracle for Obamacare to be passed, Bernie is blowing hot air about actually passing his version of M4A. The value in Joe is he knows he can get the votes for a public option. 

2: I‚Äôve spent time in both places and the American upper and middle class do really have nicer stuff. If you ever visit here, spend some time and just drive around the suburbs of a major city and poke around. I‚Äôve done that a few places in the world and am so happy I did. It gives a lot of perspective. But maybe I misjudged what I saw.

&gt; Also, the American Dream concept has been debunked as a lie a long time ago, I‚Äôve written like three essays on this topic. We are literally taught this at my university. Social mobility in the US does not seem very promising if you‚Äôre working minimum-wage and don‚Äôt have an education. The fact that education is so expensive literally prevents social mobility, while in Norway I don‚Äôt pay anything for it.

Couldn‚Äôt disagree more that the American Dream isn‚Äôt alive. I think we can both agree that we do have a growing inequity problem and achieving that dream needs some work, but social mobility is still alive and well here. My dad came from a dirt poor mining town and made a nice life for himself. Two of my roommates at school come from single parent minimum wage households and will graduate next year to their dream jobs. I totally agree we need a major overhaul to make the American Dream EASIER, but saying it‚Äôs a lie or it‚Äôs dead is completely false. 

3: 

&gt; I sure as hell won‚Äôt depend on any news station or paper seeing as most of them pick sides (some more obvious than others). The news stations and papers even tried to keep Bernie in the dark the best they could.

Yeah man this just is not true. Bernie has generated more news coverage than any major candidate in 2020 and was arguably over-covered in 2016 considering he was mathematically eliminated about this time in 2020. These are lines that get spewed from every major candidate; you‚Äôll see them here and from Trumpers and Berners. Of course there‚Äôs a partisan lean to everything, it‚Äôs impossible to keep opinions out of politics, but aggregating information from credible American news stations and papers (CNN, New Tork Times, Washington Post, Wall St Journal) will give you a good overview of events in the news without much bias."
4651,"But for real, why do you have to say ""It's a pro-Russia bernie Sanders sub""? It's literally a lie."
4652,"Welcome brother. Neither one of us will have our original candidate choice become the nominee, but for the sake of the country, we‚Äôre all in for the one who did."
4653,"For sure - that's the foundation of the Democratic party. We care that people are well, we care that people get the opportunities, and we care that we do the right thing."

The house is controlled by democrats so they don‚Äôt have to compromise. The senate is controlled by republicans so they don‚Äôt have to compromise. If you whiny brats made yourself useful and tried to primary republicans instead of democrats you wouldn‚Äôt have to compromise. Keep fucking up elections and you‚Äôll get nothing.

4673,"YOU BETTER VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHO
EVEN IF BERNIE WINS THE POPULAR VOTE IT DOESNT MEAN HES THE NOMINEE"
4674,"Sure, i will never understand that because for me she was always so likeable but thats not something that can be debated, if you just didnt like her personality i can't argue against that, its far too subjective. 

I agree, the media built this persona, maybe she didnt do a strong enough counter-initiative to that but that was actually my point - propaganda was being used against her by media of both parties. And i think it caught on so well because her last name is Clinton. 

She joined Bill in working on it after she retired from being Secretary of State. Before that Chelsea Clinton also played her part. Hillary's tenure as a Secretary of State is also worth bringing up - i recommend reading into what this job looks like. Everyone understands POTUS has enormous responsibility, very often receives little grattitude and risks his life. Well, the same is true for this position. Why am i talking about it? Because the running theme is that Hillary is in politics for money and power, and if that was true she would have remained in the Senate instead of taking up one of the most difficult jobs there are in the country. 

I hope i did change your mind and the minds of people who read these messages at least a bit. I agree entirely with your last point, Biden needs their help and thats why he had already asked for it, lets hope they answer his call."
4675,In what universe is this an important and meaningful issue right now?
4676,"The contrast now is between Bernie and Biden, and it is odd to me why Bernie is considered such a progressive. Taking those two issues you identify (LGBT+ rights and guns), Bernie has only ""come around"" in the last few years. Biden has been much more consistent and has worked on these things. 

But we can also add in immigration and climate change to this and you see Bidens record is much stronger on these things as well through behavior, not rhetoric."
4677,"They literally swarmed the Pete sub immediately after it was announced pandering to Pete's base like somehow we'd forget all the nasty things they've said and done. 

Not a chance in hell. Still wiping tears away from watching Pete's concession speech but I'm getting ready to give ol Joe some love on the donation page. Still feeling lost and blindsided but we've got to move forward. Pulling for you now, Uncle Joe."
4678,"Yea totally. First time I heard of her, and a FL win nets us a 58 electoral votes balance to our favor.

(FL has 29 votes, so if Biden wins back FL, he gains 29 while Trump loses 29. Hence 29+29=58 vote balance shifted towards Biden's favor.)"

4690,"Very, very good speech. That's how you leave them wanting more."
4691,"He doesn't care about the party, which is ultimately a capitalist party that fundamentally disagrees with his ideology. His motivation is probably more mundane.

4694,"Agreed.  This is coalition politics.  This is the big alliance of decency, where Warren and her ideas and her fans absolutely belong.  And this is the coalition that will flip the Senate, producing a Senate that will pass the bills that make change a reality instead of just something to yell from the sidelines.  Warren is one of the great minds in American politics and the country needs her voice and her legislation-writing pen.

4697,"Exactly this, Sanders dropping out wouldn't stop those elections. The elections need to be postponed and done by mandated vote by mail. Lot of states have already postponed them, the DNC is penalizing them for postponing them which doesn't make sense at all."

4712,Guess so
4713,"Perhaps help me see the other side then? Bernie is constantly explaining to us how small the .1% is, and that's about what is probability of winning is. He also constantly emphasizes the dire situation regarding healthcare in  the US, but by not dropping out before tomorrow is guaranteeing more stress to the system in those communities. 



He should do the right thing: drop out, save some lives, and be who I thought he was back in 2016."

4718,"It's incredible that Bernie plans to stay in.

The rest of the primary is going to be a slow motion arse kicking. 

Every loss is going to undermine his ""movement""."
4719,I disagree. This mentality reminds me of after NH when Bernie bros were calling Pete to drop despite having a similar delegate count. I under stand it's a little different but calling him unethical is a bit of a stretch.
4720,People really have to learn to stop holding white easily photoshopped signs directly level with camera.

4722,"I‚Äôm also of Chinese descent, and I think it was a valid response. He was trying to explain that criticisms of authoritarian regimes can coexist with praises of their achievements. 

Soviet Union was the first to get a man in space, among many other things. That was a significant scientific and technological achievement. That should be recognized and acknowledged, even if you disagree with, or condemn their political system."

4724,What about Gillum?
4725,"The 9 are a mix of PACs, Super PACs, and 501 dark money groups. Bernie acts like he has the biggest ethical pecker on the planet, but he doesn't even pass his own purity tests. No matter what the difference is, they're all shady and unaccountable."
4726,"Should people  not be concerned if legislators show a clear misunderstanding of the terminology regarding economics? If you propose legislation, you should have a basic enough familiarity to understand the how to talk about it knowledgeably. 

And it does bother me that many Democrats instant response to shootings are simply banning whatever weapon used rather than focusing on underlying issues. 

Furthermore the ease of circumventing policies such as magazine restrictions is stupidly easy, since they are so easy to manufacture without large scale industrial resources.

I still support Joe, but I feel like the lack of knowledge on such an important subject is definitely something that harms the democrats politically."
4727,"We welcome any Sanders supporters who behave in a civil manner and are committed to defeating Trump.

I know Sanders supporters believe in some miracle that will occur at the next debate due to lies about Biden's mental status.  They are grieving.  The bubble at /s4p and /pol is insane, and empirical evidence has therefore been tough to accept.

Sanders went home to Vermont.  He didn't take free media time last night.  I can't find evidence that he's campaigning today.  i think the writing is on the wall."

4735,"This is an absurd term. Everything is identity politics except when you‚Äôre the default identity.  

For Christ‚Äôs sake, Trump‚Äôs whole thing is the identity politics of the angry white man."
4736,High malarkey levels
4737,12/15 correct. Guess I can more or less tell.
4738,Let‚Äôs compare the deaths there and here when this is all over. RemindMe! 60 days
4739,"Why wouldn‚Äôt he work to enact his policies?  What‚Äôs the point of running on a platform if one doesn‚Äôt seek to put it into effect?  Politicians almost always enact or attempt to enact their policy agendas.  They represent promises to the base, and that means the people a politician is beholden to are going to want it.

I mean, let‚Äôs go with the maximally negative view of Joe - that he doesn‚Äôt care about these policies and only wants the job to have the job.  This view classes him as a cynical man - something which I would vehemently disagree with, but for the sake of argument let‚Äôs roll with it.

Why *wouldn‚Äôt* he try to enact his agenda?  If it‚Äôs all about him and his ego, why wouldn‚Äôt he try to make good on his promises?  A cynical politician would want to be known for their greatness, after all, and their legacy..... so why would he stonewall his left leaning agenda?

Donors?  Nah, he probably isn‚Äôt going to run for a second term and definitely doesn‚Äôt need the money.... and he swore off corporate donations anyways.

He believes something else?  I mean, maybe, perhaps, but then why wouldn‚Äôt he run on that other belief?

Look, most of his agenda probably isn‚Äôt going to happen.  It never would with any President - they aren‚Äôt dictators and depend on a deeply dysfunctional Congress to pass bills.  But he would almost certainly make a serious attempt at the highlights, just like Bernie would.  And when he falls short, like Obama did when he tried and failed to pass a public option or close Gitmo, we should remember the limited powers of the President and remember to keep our expectations reasonable."
4740,"Florida will be close. Arizona may go our way, the polls look good. I'm hopeful about Pennsylvania and Michigan, but not Wisconsin."
4741,If you honestly believe this then how do you believe Sanders will be Trump when he clearly can't even beat Biden ? Lol
4742,How do we feel about these rape allegations....
4743,I can't stop laughing.
4744,Are you talking about the polling margin?  Clinton was 50% to Trumps 38% on some polls in October 2016.  Biden can very easily lose this election.
4745,"&gt; Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is picking up several Maryland endorsements after the Super Tuesday primaries, including one from a former Baltimore mayor who had been in Michael Bloomberg‚Äôs camp.
&gt; 
&gt; U.S. Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Baltimore County and fellow Maryland congressman David Trone plan to endorse the former vice president Thursday, according to a statement from Biden‚Äôs campaign.
&gt; 
&gt; Former Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said in a text message that she is also endorsing Biden, whose strong performance Tuesday assured his status as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination..."
4746,"‚ÄúI can only handle one issue at a time.‚Äú

Not good for a President."
4747,"Because Biden actually addressed the issues at hand while Sanders always reverted to attacks or his two talking points of ""corporations are bad"" and ""why are we the only nation that doesn't provide healthcare"" while not actually answering the question."
4748,"Lmao, rightwing neoliberal extremism and declaring war on the workers of the world is not an ""inclusive global future."""
4749,"Personally I think Biden‚Äôs platform is already left enough for centrist, and no matter how much he shifts left, it may never be good enough for Bernie Bro‚Äôs (Warren was not left enough for them). In doing so, we risk to alienate  centrists. For example, Biden has free community colleges, which makes sense to me. Also, cancelling student debt is a no go for me. People should held accountable for the money they borrow, however we can negotiate on the interest or charges. As long as there is some form of accountability, I am ok with the plan. Sadly, we only have limited funds and we need to prioritize on how best use the fund, increasing tax is a no go. The whole reasons Bernie could not get traction in the election is because his plan just does not add up."
4750,"If you're looking for a comprehensive refutation of the accusation against him, [this one is pretty complete.](https://np.reddit.com/r/PresidentialRaceMemes/comments/fozndh/rapist_upmalarkey_so_joe_bidens_face_shows_first/flj22ns/)"
4751,Until it comes to the general.  Good luck with out that large wing of the party. See: 2016.
4752,"I had an argument with someone once because they claimed it didn't matter if Bernie lost the House and Senate, he could just do his entire agenda through executive orders. What a solid plan..."
4753,Based. Winning over independents and NeverTrump/Trump-exhausted Republicans in the Great Lakes is how you seal the deal on this thing.

&gt;10 days ago doesn't count

Keep moving those goal posts."
4755,Ol boy got that strong jaw
4756,Thank you very much
4757,"Yes, just keep playing it. Trump will rue the day he inserted himself into a health matter. Today‚Äôs press conference was his best so far, but that‚Äôs after bungling it for two weeks straight. Even today, he‚Äôs doing exactly what health experts say NOT to do ... huddle in close proximity with others."
4758,Is that really your top priority right now?
4759,Thank you Joe for adopting this. It really helps the supporters to keep their behavior and their comments in check and keep us all on the right track.
4760,"Really good signs from FL. Turnout will still pass 2016 despite COVID-19. If there was no pandemic, I bet it would've been higher. It is important because Trump will be extremely formidable in FL as it is his home state. Biden is looking competitive!"
4761,"It's tough to say. He had to deal with unprecedented levels of obstruction while carrying the weight of being the first black president in history. He likely felt undue pressure to compromise so he wasn't seen as ineffective. That all said, it's clear he was very competent, took the job very seriously, and applied his morality to it as best as he was allowed."
4762,"I'm beginning to feel that Val Demings is the best VP pick. She's smart, uncontroversial, aligned with Joe on many of the issues, and picking her would be a great show of support for the African American community who have been critical to Joe for the primaries and will be critical in the general election. Her Florida roots will be a big help and a strong black voter turnout could help swing other critical states like North Carolina, Michigan, Ohio, and even Georgia/Texas."
4763,Because it is.

I'm sure you'll find a place here :), unlike the other candidate, we don't harass or bother you for having your own opinion. We're open and free :D"
4767,that scares me in the general because trump will not hold back on that
4768,"That's not the point. Yes the issues are real. Joe has solutions planned for essentially all of them. This tweet is insinuating that he wants to go back to nothing? No health reform? No election financing reform? That's just a lie that Bernie is using while grasping at straws and you know it. It's just unfair to say that Joe wants to ""go back"" when he's running a forward leaning Democratic platform."
4769,That would truly bring me Joy!
4770,I really hope the ticket is age balanced more than anything. A running mate also in their 70s would be extremely disappointing regardless of gender.
4771,"&gt;We just need ranked choice voting

Seconding this!"
4772,"A small thing, but I love how Joe repeats some words. Like he often repeats thank you."
4773,I agree. Also Amy and Joe are both weak at attracting younger voters. I would love to see Pete on the ticket and I think Joe does as well.
4774,"You need swing states to beat Trump in the general election. The term socialism has been demonized so much that it scares people and it's seen as too radical. Those swing voters aren't going to vote for destroying the whole system. On the other hand a more moderate candidate like Biden can attract those voters who are tired of Trump and see Biden as safe. 

Also, you need to be able to keep a Dem House and get a Dem Senate. Biden at the top of the ticket helps House/Senate seats in swing states such as Arizona/Maine. Bernie at the top of ticket means socialism is at the top of the ticket and that will be difficult for House &amp; Senate members and House &amp; Senate candidates to deal with in local areas. It could create a bad downward ballot disaster."
4775,Uh no. Big nope.
4776,No idea!
4777,Subbed. I enjoy y‚Äôall‚Äôs memes better than the Sanders ones anyway.
4778,"I think debates are good, we need the voters to know the candidates.

We know what we need to know at this stage. Joe can pivot to what he‚Äôs best at, talking to people one on one."
4779,Not in the middle of a pandemic.
4780,Incoming endorsement?
4781,"This was so moving and I‚Äôm still shocked he said this, not because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs warranted but because I still can‚Äôt imagine him saying anything like this."
4782,"&gt;but there was a similar situation in Illinois

On that note, what are your thoughts on Chris Kennedy?"
4783,"As of about 10am 36,523 voters
51.4% Women

6-7am: 5,910
7-8am: 8,465
8-9am: 10,019
9-10am: 12,129

66% of the voters so far today are over 50 years old. 
Just over 7% of voters today so far 17-29 years old."
4784,"I hope this can eventually persuade some of the Bernouts to vote for Biden in November.

They keep parrotting the narrative that Trump and Biden are the same and that he doesnt do anything for progressives. 

I know its been rough. Especially if you look at how well things seemed to go in Iowa, NH and especially Nevada. But getting Trump out of office is just so crucial for the progressive movement as well."
4785,"Harris and Biden are longtime friends, their families go way back. She absolutely would run with him."
4786,"Bernie's campaign strategy was tailored towards winning with 30-35% of the vote and hoping that everyone else would stay in the field into super tuesday and beyond. Once that didn't happen, it blew up in his face and they had no plan B moving forward. Had they pivoted towards an inclusive message after NH, it probably would have been different.... but establishment, DNC, rigged, something something."
4787,"Yeah, I hope it‚Äôs not a repeat of 2016 where the primary goes all the way to the convention. Being unable to pivot to the general until pretty late hurt Hillary. Bernie has to realize that all these attacks against Joe are just going straight into the republican playbook. I‚Äôd prefer if he stuck to his own message and just wait to see if the voters want it or not."
4788,This is along the lines of what I was thinking and what worries me as a patient. I‚Äôm hoping Biden and Congress work something out to keep and allow state medical programs to be recognized under the federal government because it is crazy how I have a medical card for a legitimate reason but employers can still restrict it.
4789,"Former big Pete supporter who is now all in for Biden here. I won't speak to his policies, as that I'm sure can be answered by someone more versed than I but I will say this:

The thing that won me over to Pete was his wonderful message of unity. Despite the homophobia and hateful rhetoric of some in the Bernie camp, he never deviated from that message - let's unify this party and then the country. He also realized that winning the presidency wasn't enough, we need to win the house and senate.

I was nervous about Joe but the town hall before SC and his victory speech afterwards sealed it for me  - he gets it. This country needs someone who wants to unify, not further the schisms in our society. His message isn't ""us vs them"", it's one of unity and healing.

As Pete said: We can't have a candidate that only believes my way or the highway."
4790,"Check out his twitter meltdowns, its so much good material"
4791,"Sexism played a part for sure, but based on the polling over the last couple weeks (and going back to the midterms), it‚Äôs possible Elizabeth Warren misread the political winds and thought the Democratic electorate was a lot more left-leaning than it actually is.  She wanted to occupy Bernie‚Äôs lane, when she should have been running in Joe‚Äôs."
4792,"Most global experience, which is what's needed to deal with the world. Which is the actual job of the President.

That's key right there. The President needs to have global connections."
4793,Welcome!
4794,"This. We are not all the same. And south florida is not just Cuban but all over south american. This absolutely does not surprise me as a latina from the s florida community I can tell you a large number of us have families who fled socialist countries, not just Cuba but Venezuela, Nicaragua etc..our family was forced to flee a socialist country.

4799,"I mean it‚Äôs a bit of a tail wagging the dog situation. Obama has to run far more centrist campaign so that he could win the far more centrist party‚Äôs nomination, and then help move everything to a much more progressive place by the time he left"
4800,"Welcome my friend. Let‚Äôs get Trump out of office!!!

Biden was not my first choice either but he has my full support now"
4801,"Duh.  

We all saw what he did in 2016 and we all know he didn't learn a damn thing since then"
4802,Sanders' campaign has been de facto over since before Warren even dropped out. Why would she jump on board a sinking ship?
4803,"Also nearly identical to what Hillary had proposed.

And if we can pass it, it'll be an enormous step forward given that *totally free college for all incomes* is a virtual non-starter in this political environment."
4804,Community options on the sidebar!
4805,Yes I agree. Just saying he didn‚Äôt drop today.
4806,"It *is* hard to argue that the ""Bros"" narrative is something he can't be expected to control when it's paid staff doing it."

4818,"She is, and so is Ivanka Trump.

I don't want either of them anywhere near the Executive Branch."
4819,The weird part is me being perfectly fine with a lot of Sanders policies but being attacked for thinking it's more efficient to work within the existing framework rather than try to overhaul everything again. Like am I the only person that remembers how much lifting went into getting the ACA passed?

The system is broken, Trump is a symptom of the broken system, not the cause. Bidens plan is the same plan as Sanders campaign platform for the last 40 years. The difference is Sanders realizes that cancer, heart disease, HIV etc are just as much a threat too people as Covid19. 

Sanders is saying the 1,800,000 every year who are diagnosed with cancer need help with their crisis as well, not just the people dealing with this crisis. Biden is saying who cares about those people we can't worry about them right now 

Bernie is saying just covering Coronavirus doesn't include care for families who lose people to the virus. 

Sanders cares about everyone's suffering. Biden seems to only care when it's politically relevant."

4830,"I emphatically disagree. Imagine you‚Äôre a dude in West Virginia with no degree, your just lost your job in the mines that‚Äôs all you‚Äôve known. Your town is decimated. Or maybe this is your husband. If I were him just tuning into the debate for each party, I would think Trump was trying to help me more than the the Democrats in 2016 and 2020. We have put so much of the emphasis on things that you just don‚Äôt care about. Healthcare is maybe the only thing the Dems are discussing that you care about, but outside of that what appeals to you? You just want your job to come back and to put food on the table for your family. 

Point being: Dems are doing an unbelievably poor job of reaching out to these people. I think once Joe focuses his attention to these folks in the general, this gap closes. I agree there is an element of racism at play, but the people that would swing back are the same people that voted for Barry O in 2008 AND 2012. The racists are gonna vote for Trump no matter what. I‚Äôve seen this play out in my family. I loathe Trump and I honestly don‚Äôt think my family members who voted for him in 16 were racists. I think they were duped by a conman who played to a desperate and scared group of people. Obviously there‚Äôs more to it than that, but I think calling racism is doing a great disservice to the factors that created Trump and ignores the fact we can welcome back these people and help them rebuild their lives."
4831,"Sirota wrote a specious hit piece on Beto accusing him of being in the pocket of big oil and topedo'd Beto's campaign before he even announced. Sirota pretended to be a journalist and wrote it a week before he was officially on Team Bernie. Sirota and co said Beto was in the pocket of big oil because he got high donations from oil workers (and every other group like teachers) in the 2018 senate run and had a 95% lifetime rating from LCV, higher than Bernie's rating. It was a bad faith piece that was rebutted but no one care about the gritty details of votes. 

 The Bernie establishment of journalists like the Brueinings trashed Beto' endlessly with bad faith attacks to support Bernie. Then you had the sunrise movement arm of the Bernie campaign trashing Beto's energy plan before they even read it. Beto released the first one and it was ambitious! But they trashed it as a reflex so 20 articles came out saying how terrible it was before their apology and walk back.

Bernie has been working on progressive agenda since before you were born most likely


&gt;This is why I'm for Joe, despite my differences with his political outlook. Yeah, I'm more progressive. But Joe has been a Democrat all his life, like me.

What

&gt;He's seen hard losses. He's done what he could when he could. He's supported people more conservative than he is, because they were Democrats and that's what was necessary at the time.

This is the this shit reasons im going to have to vote for a dumbass like Joe Biden this election, fucking really? 

&gt;Democrats of my and my parents' generation are the Establishment. I'm happy to own that title.We've been fighting all our lives. That's why Bernie didn't get our votes and that's why we are for Joe.

This is infuriatingly /////// fighting for what? Oh wow we aloud gay people to get married in 20fucking14 oh wow gee thanks. Joe Biden is just another generic do nothing candidate.

While I hold out few hopes of strong bipartisan legislation, Joe is an extremely personally liked politician on both sides of the aisle.  When common ground can be found, he will find it.

A big secret of Congress and the Senate, is that there are a lot of cross-aisle friendships.  There are congressmen of different parties that actually live together (rent in DC isn't cheap).

Everyone knows something needs to be done about healthcare.  And just because a proposal comes from Republicans, doesn't mean it's bad.  Republicans overwhelmingly support transparent hospital billing, which is something Biden wants as well."

In terms of policy I genuinely believe Biden can accomplish what hes promised (unlike Sanders) and with trade I'd much rather see Biden in charge because Sanders has a history of being a protectionist like Trump (Meaning he could possibly attack out economy.)

Something I've come to dislike about the far-left Bernie supporters or the self described ""Dirtbag left""(Chapo users) is I've seen numerous homophobic dog whistles used against Pete by them such as refering to him as ""Butt""(totally not meant as an attack on anal sex) and numerous claims that solving class division will end social problems.

Biden wasn't not even a thought in a lot of people's minds at the start of the entire campaigning season, but as soon as the playing field was narrowed down to the last three or so candidates, everyone starts to back Biden and support him with the attitude that he's been the best choice this entire time.

It's also weird how his campaign hasn't self-destructed over the entire Tara Reade incident, and how it's not really being focused on as it should be."

&gt;In fact, the former vice president may be the only one who can fulfill the Democratic desire to deny Trump a second term.

&gt;The other front-runner, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is too far to the left to pull together the coalition of Democrats, moderate Republicans and independents necessary to win the White House.

4889,"I support Sanders.  I am also a younger voter.  I cannot vote for biden.  I would have been able to if the elections seemed fair and the establishment didn't put their fingers on the scale for biden. 

 If he had won on his own merits then fine.  But feeling like my vote will not have any worth whatsoever I cannot bring myself to vote for him.  The only way I could would be if he chose a progressive vp or said he will only be a 1 term president.

  Otherwise it would be better in my opinion to elect Trump again and have a better chance in 2024 to get someone who is more aligned with my beliefs. 

   I fear that because of the establishment forcing biden to be the choice the way they did that they just lost the youth vote for a long time.  You have definitely lost me for this election.  

  I am not trying to be mean but I am just trying to get all biden supporters here to understand how me and most of my friends feel.  I think biden will lose the election to Trump since he will have lost the youth.  The boomers will vote Trump anyway and the older Dems will support any Dem candidate.  Independents think biden is corrupt or will vote Dem anyway so without younger people like me to combat Trump's overwhelming lead with boomers I can't see biden winning currently."
4890,My bad.  Live long and prosper.
4891,"Again with this.  'Sanders supporters attacking from the back', references in other threads to dark money interests promoting Sanders.  All this while Bernie is doing DAILY fire side chats and telling CNN reporters to fuck off when queried why he's not dropping out.  It's a great suggestion to have Biden be a goddamn face of this.  He's the presumptive nominee.  His Twitter account is doing stuff?  Really?  When is the last time Joe has popped up like Sanders?

If my public schools are funded by property taxes, and I'm paying what the city says I owe on property to fund public schools (and let's stipulate it's a fair amount to fund public schools, no tax dodging), why shouldn't I be allowed to spend more to send my kids to a private school?"

I was originally for Biden until he started pushing his gun control platform and moved my support to  Buttigieg.  After Pete dropped out I was again leaning to Biden.  Now not so much.  I will never, ever support Sanders or Trump.  As a democrat who also supports Second Amendment rights I'm screwed.  If Biden dropped the anti-firearm rhetoric he could get a lot more support which he needs to beat Sanders."
4962,"I‚Äôve persuaded both of my parents to vote for Biden over Bloomberg in RI. It‚Äôll be a while until they vote, but still."
4963,"I really disliked Pritzker getting elected, so much so that I ended up voting 3rd party, but he has impressed me with his leadership skills. This is another win for Joe."
4964,"Yeah like....I feel like there's a line between criticizing party leadership and criticizing party VOTERS, and it's not a particularly thin line, but Bernie never really manages to walk it. I don't think any politician really has any business criticizing how voters vote; it's their job to convince us they've earned our vote, they don't get to bitch about who we give it to, because if we vote for someone they don't like -- even if it's Trump -- it's because \*they\* fucked up their one job and didn't convince us, not \*us\* fucking up.

And actually, now that I think about it, there's a line between criticizing party leadership and \*insulting\* party leadership, and Bernie divebombs across THAT line on a daily basis. Some of those people he and his supporters are talking so much shit about and accusing of rigging elections are in office BECAUSE I VOTED TO PUT THEM THERE. Acting like they're some blatantly obvious scumbag that should be removed from office is kind of a weird angle because I'm just like, no, they're exactly where I want them to be, back off.

Warren was probably my #2, but by the time Pete dropped out she was already pretty clearly nonviable. She's probably the only other candidate that I would have been genuinely pleased to see win, as opposed to just like, settling for.

IDK. Basically I went with Pete (initially; fell in love with the policies after) over Warren because of tone. And \*Bernie\* is kind of....about as polar opposite on tone as it's possible to get. So every time he opens his mouth, he makes it more and more impossible for me to ever consider voting for him. I'm not going to sit here and pretend other American voters are my enemy just so it suits Bernie's narrative."
4965,Klobuchar
4966,He doesn‚Äôt care as long as he can get concessions.
4967,"I'm noticing certain people suddenly referring to Sanders as ""Bernard"". Is this from somewhere in particular?  It's an interesting emergent tic."
4968,Agree. I always try to look for the best in people.
4969,"Now progressives will be tied with socialism for a while, even though Warren is a capitalist."
4970,"Oh well, replied to wrong comment."
4971,It is not a stutter to confuse your wife and sister.
4972,"Beto and Biden need to announce their W4A  (Whataburger for all) plan.  For far to long Americans have been denied affordable access to Whataburgers Nationwide. 

 Day 1 Executive Order W4A

Taco Johns too"
4973,"Probably not in NJ, Biden's boosted because of the Pennsylvania/Delaware proximity."
4974,"This is insane, he doesn‚Äôt have it?? Sen. Obama had USSS details as early as May 2007."
4975,"Ohhh, the Trump troll who LARPs as a progressive doesn't like to be called out on r/politics so he follows me here."
4976,"..fucking what i graduate in may goddamnit.

Whatever i dont mind moving. Everyone keep on the lookout for places that need physical therapists!!"
4977,"That 10% is enough to swing the election, see 2016 where 70k votes across three states determined the outcome."
4978,"Trump was unknown and his lies sounded very palatable to many, this is no longer the case. HRC had been demonized for decades and Bernie tried to leverage this which help  to suppress the vote. The Russians and Cambridge Analytica leveraged social media to cause chaos in a naive electorate. The Dems had been in control for 8 years and its very hard to go back to back, people want change. 2018 elections moved the female suburban vote to the left in a response to Trump being so disgusting.  People thought HRC had it in the bag and slept on it in many areas or made a ""protest vote"" to show the Dems.  

None of these things are going on now.

You personally may know people as I do but the areas that the vote was less wasn't Bernie strong holds."
4979,"THANK YOU. Anyone who refuses to vote because their candidate didn't win should just go slap RBG, and while they're at it - women everywhere, in the face."
4980,"I live about 2 hours from Asheville, NC!"
4981,No environmental provisions - sad. The stimulus bill has so much potential to help fight climate change and restore public lands.
4982,You really wanna pull this malarkey now Biden fans?  Keep shrinking this big tent and see what happens.  I'm borderline going Green with this stuff.
4983,Bless your heart.
4984,Bad thing about my candidate? Moving on!
4985,"DOMA was a step towards acceptance. A swamp that one had to traverse in order to get something done.

4986,it's called winning an election lol
4987,"I thought this post from Buttigieg's comm chief Lis Smith yesterday was interesting, apparently she was also a Sanders voter in 2016:

&gt; I never thought I‚Äôd be a Sanders (2016) - Biden (2020) voter, but here we are.

4988,"The poll also includes swing state votes, with Biden +8 in them. It also discusses ‚Äúclose districts‚Äù, in which Biden leads by +25"
4989,Yeah! Their only fault was looking like know-it-alls! Not accomplishing absolutely nothing towards those goals. Lol
4990,"Updated list of candidates who have dropped and endorsed Biden. 

* Seth Multon
* Kirsten  Gillibrand 
* Tim Ryan
* Beto O'Rourke
* Kamala Harris
* Cory Booker
* John Delaney 
* Andrew Yang
* Deval Patrick 
* Pete Buttigieg 
* Amy Klobuchar 
* Michael Bloomberg 
* Tulsi Gabbard 

He has the backing of 15 US Senators, 27 former Senators, 109(almost half of the Democrats in the house) sitting Representatives and 37 former. As well as 7 current and 23 previous governors."
4991,"I do too. He's a little shit. But a loveable little shit.  He's like your neighbor who shovels your walk for you, but then always runs over to talk to you when you get home to tell you HE did it. So now you have to talk to him for 30 fucking minutes."
4992,felt that one. :(
4993,Cabinets are not primarily made up of other candidates. All the senators will just stay in their current positions (same with Tulsi in the house). Really it's just Pete and Yang looking for work.
4994,"Yet, I see nothing about Biden on the first several pages of politics and news is still pretty hard to come by.

I wish we had Ohio. If we had those results we could've made a more solid case."
4995,"Same, but like many Americans I want to see the government succeed in building a well running healthcare infastructure first. If the theoretical design is indeed cheaper and more efficient (which I believe it to be) then let's go out there and prove it. That means putting our full weight into development but let private insurance coexist. Keep private insurance as the bar raiser to differentiate on serviceability which can justify higher prices than the public option."
4996,"&gt;He should not be using the threat of nuisance primaries to extort Biden into making concessions

Why? That is the whole point of the primary if you don't win. Other than getting your name into the national arena, like other candidates this round.

I am on the ""he should drop out now"" train. However, he should try to use his influence to get some concessions if possible."

4999,"Something important to remember is that the president is not an autocrat(or at least shouldn't be). Biden has some decent policy proposals that are safe, but he doesn't get to introduce those proposals to congress, someone has to do it for him. Then those proposals have to work their way through committee rewrites, along with the amendment process on the open floor. There is all the opportunity in the world to drag his proposals further left, if we have the numbers to do it. Every single vote up and down the ballot that we get is one step closer to a congress that actually can pass more progressive policy."
5000,"I read it, but it isn‚Äôt solving the problem

When they‚Äôre talking about for profit colleges they‚Äôre talking about shams like Corinthian Colleges was. Not Harvard. 

There isn‚Äôt anything to address this, a kid can shun free school and run up debt attending Harvard - and they will 

It‚Äôs a behavioral issue, for most people college is much more affordable then the student loan debt implies. We have community colleges available and kids don‚Äôt choose them. Often colleges are selected for social reasons not educational. Loan money isn‚Äôt always spent wisely.

Where is the control on the student choices? Again, without getting out of the loan business you will be here again. 

Students will be marketed to and choose prestigious schools they don‚Äôt need to if you allow it.

I‚Äôm interested in knowing why you think refinancing isn‚Äôt the better choice, when we did that successfully for housing and we had it in the platform last time."
5001,"Eventually, though, he got sick of Biden not collapsing and decided to enter the race and try to make him collapse."
5002,"Same with Tom Steyer.

Dude flopped hard in South Carolina"
5003,"I have my issues here in CA where the electricity we create are not being utilized for its citizens but rather sold to other states. There are many things that I hesitate when it comes to Biden deciding on things, but at least with his administration, we can discuss things. We have a president that is destructive and his administration is deaf and blind to us, and if Biden takes his advisers direction, than at least we would could create an administration to discuss the path we are taking, rather than to be completely ignored."

5005,Secretary of Transportation is important but I think Ambassador to the UN or Secretary of Veterans Affairs would be better suited to Mayor Pete's strengths.
5006,"Dude, as a fellow Bernie supporter, stop. You're only making us look bad."
5007,"a large number of Sanders voters are first time voters, first time democratic voters and people entering the political discussion for the first time BECAUSE of what Bernie was offering. I don‚Äôt think you can count on these all of these votes in the general election. They are not Democratic voters, they are Bernie voters."
5008,They always argue he only voted for it because it included the Violence Against Women Act...which was written by Joe Biden.
5009,I had the radio on and it seemed like the transition from welcome to live coverage -&gt; Biden projected winner was instant.
5010,"They expected her to drop and endorse sanders before Super Tuesday. If she was really behind the progressive movement, I kinda agree with the sanders supporters here"
5011,"Sure, if someone from Bidens camp calls Bernie a commie, I‚Äôm against that."
5012,Even after sll the smearing and hate by right and sadly by the left too she was 10 days away to win..but comey...f him...
5013,***HIGHER AND HIGHER***
5014,"It was clearly rhetorical. Spending time to list them out would have been silly. But his point is still correct. Sanders doesn't pass his own purity test.

Also, why would I vote for a candidate that tells me he isn't go to do everything possible to beat Trump?"
5015,Beto isn't a latino........
5016,"Cross-posting from ESS, plus because I know it won't get a serious response in (arr) politics: 

I vehemently disagree with Trump's decision to start calling this the ""Chinese virus."" I think this rhetoric going to fuel racism against Chinese nationals, Asian-Americans, and citizens of or immigrants from other East Asian countries, and absolutely appears to blame a country rather than its government.   


With that said, do you guys feel that China's initial response, both within their own borders and to the US's early measures, has largely been forgotten in this crisis? [This](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51353279?fbclid=IwAR3qtwwkAG1OdL2WIl2ZCCJWPJ0YIc2lAcwphbtLLR74pR4DhurJT3myOK0) BBC article from early February shows China downplaying its own outbreak and calling the US's decision to close its borders ""a cause of unnecessary panic."" Plus the claim on twitter from the Chinese ambassador that the US military actually created this virus and then brought it to Wuhan. This isn't a conspiracy theory podcaster, it's a government official with real power. Combined with the brutality committed against the Hong Kong protesters, I have real concerns about China's global actions.  


Are you guys concerned? How do you guys see Joe Biden and his future VP + cabinet handling these concerns? Would you like them to respond differently?"
5017,"A lot of uncertainty between here and then. I wouldn‚Äôt expect this margin to swing too wide. That being said, I think we are seeing what 4 more years of trump looks like, and what 8 years of Biden would look like."
5018,Defending Castro was not a good look for Bernie
5019,"The VP has the exact same requirements per the Constitution as the Presidency, but given Obama is constitutionally barred from being President again and 'immediately assume Presidency if President quits or dies' is the main reason the Vice Presidency exists I don't think it would fly.

Even if he could do it Obama would have to resign as VP as soon as Biden quits or dies since he couldn't become President thus rendering the point of the office moot and ensuring a constitutional clusterfuck."
5020,"Lol I am also relying on PSLF when I graduate(medical school debt + primary care). From what I understand that would at worst stay the same for current borrowers(even Trump's proposed scrapping of the program grandfathers in current borrowers, and PSLF is written into or MPNs), but for new borrowers its unclear to me whether his new simplified PSLF which would be capped at 50K(10k per year for 5 years) would be replacing the old one or in addition to the old PSLF. Based on his wording I'm pretty sure it is in addition to but it if confusing because the 2 programs have the same name."
5021,Yup. Campaigning is a thing for a reason :)
5022,CNN to. Even Fox News has called it.
5023,"I understand your point. I don‚Äôt think M4A will pass either but I think the Democrats have shown a commitment to improving the healthcare system, which I don‚Äôt see in Trump. 

I don‚Äôt think Sanders plans on doing away with border protection, he‚Äôs been critical of Trump‚Äôs approach to immigration but so has Obama, and he deported hundreds of thousands of people."
5024,"&gt;Can she really put Florida into play

I see Florida as Lean R, but, I think she could do a far greater job than Harris would ever do. 

She has a great voting record, she's serving on some of the top committees right now, was an impeachment manager against Trump, and her voting record (especially against guns) is top-notch. I could see her being a Gore-esque VP - quiet and not active in a lot, but ready to take the lead at a moment's notice, capable of maintaining national support, and a bright political future."
5025,I‚Äôm going to vote on the 17th. Great excuse to get part of the day off work ;)
5026,"That was why Warren was much higher on my candidate rankings than Bernie, even if their goals are similar. His long history of pseudoscience and disregard for evidence shows his thought process. His strive for ideological purity over results is a dangerous game to play when people's lives are on the line."
5027,The fact that a current governor shitposts on Reddit is hilarious and amazing.
5028,"He won‚Äôt. Even if he controlled the House it would fail. The idea he would be a moderate in Europe is a farce. There not a single comparable health care system as Medicare for All.

He also won‚Äôt pass the wealth tax, not because of some shady billionaire lobbying, but because it doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs another policy even Glorious Scandinavia doesn‚Äôt want."
5029,"I've been thinking long and hard of whether I will vote for Joe. Biden has gotten some of the most catastrophic bills though. I get that people make bad decisions, but I haven't seen any self reflection on Biden's part. The veto m4a interview was like a middle finger up. The whole dem party gives me cult like ""be seen and not heard"" vibes."
5030,https://gfycat.com/scarcemadeupimago/
5031,"I like Warren, but I think she'd be too old for a ticket with Joe. I remember in 96 when Jack Kemp, then 61, was on a ticket with Bob Dole, then 73, and it was a bit of an own goal as plenty of detractors ran with the ""they're too old"" line. If Biden wins, he'll be the oldest president ever. I think another 70 year old on the ticket would be an easy attack line and cause some nervousness. I'd rather see Warren somewhere else in the admin."
5032,Yeah I think the fact that he adopted her bankruptcy policy says that he won‚Äôt pick her.
5033,Lmao Bernie at his rally just congratulated Joe and half of the crowd booed us! No respect!
5034,Good!! Can‚Äôt wait to cast my vote.
5035,"Sure thats fine. But if that means hanging in a race that he is realistically eliminated from (ala 2016 flashbacks) then that would be a problem. To be clear, he's not realistically eliminated yet, but depending on how tomorrow and March 17 go, I hope he's prepared to drop out if results go a certain way."
5036,I wouldn't mind seeing him in Health and Human Services.
5037,"He is winning with them in Florida.

Edit: and it's pretty close in Arizona."
5038,"The latter part isn't a conspiracy, it's the Republican strategy."
5039,I agree. Things can change on a dime especially with this pandemic and how it plays out. It's still a good sign though.
5040,Of course! Sanders is different; Trump is scary.
5041,"It was more a move to try to capture a market of potential fans that didn't have a comic of their own. Miller, as well as most comedians, is a contrarian and libertarian at heart, so it made a lot of sense to see how he got there. Now he's appeared on Fox so many times that liberals won't give him the light of day anymore, so he's stuck. 

Of course his act suffered, and he doesn't have the same appeal to his target audience the way Larry the Cable Guy does."
5042,"No, no they really didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a really complicated answer but the war ended because it ended. The protest movement took victory there when it wasn‚Äôt due at all."
5043,I thought I read somewhere that Biden wanted to federally legalized weed?
5044,"Read the article ‚ÄúThe IAM used to do its endorsement like other unions, but overhauled the system after the 2016 election. Like many other labor groups in that cycle, the union jumped out early for Hillary Clinton, the eventual nominee, and no doubt rankled members who preferred Sanders in that contest. Many unions are being more cautious this time around and holding back an endorsement while the primary is still contested.

The machinists union announced its new process last May and encouraged members to register to vote. The voting was overseen by an independent third party.‚Äù"
5045,"Yeah I wouldn't honestly put too much stake on polls from Michigan honestly since polling has been really terrible this cycle, and it was really terrible in that state last cycle."
5046,"Simple answer: no. 

The Congress has to make a change to the bankruptcy code."
5047,i wonder if Justin Amash holds his seat.
5048,"How was Quinn? I keep hearing him referred to as ""the forgotten one"". If he lost to Rauner - even in 2014 - he couldn't have been all that amazing."
5049,I mean lowkey she‚Äôs got *taste* darling
5050,I think we were saying the same thing.
5051,"You're ignoring the fact that Progressives and Independents are two different groups, but both feel screwed over by the current political system. Bernie supporters didn't cost Hillary the election. You also can't make fucking changes if the party won't make changes. I don't care about all these social changes, I want economic change. I don't care if you think I'd somehow cost you the election, it's true to an extent but like, give me an actually good reason to vote for y'all. 

Voting Biden will literally result in another Trump appearing a few years down the road, while the Democrats continue to twiddle their thumbs and do fuck all. When do my views get to matter to the Democrats? I'm not just going to sit here and spend another 20 fucking years voting blue no matter who because y'all refuse to see a bigger picture. Progressives supporting Blue no matter who has finally got social changes after what, 28 years, cool, gonna make me wait another 28 to get Economic change?

Also again, if Hillary hadn't have been such a terrible candidate and Obama actually appointed someone onto the Supreme Court, we would still have a Democratic Majority on the Supreme Court. Simply more reasons not to support Biden from my end. I say it again, death by medical and other debt and all the other bullshit purposely stacked against us isn't particularly different from a fascist dictatorship. Death and pain remain constant through the two."
5052,His half-hearted attempts to not call the President an idiot in his daily briefings are pretty fantastic.
5053,"Calling important people, learning about the issues, biblically addressing that issue and taking the time to move his campaign over to the general.

Because Sanders is toast and we've gotta focus on Trump."
5054,"If it were credible it'd be the story of the year but it's a last gasp of a dying campaign grasping for some ""major event"" to put their guy over the top."
5055,"Bernie wiped the floor with Biden, what are you goobers even talking about?"
5056,"[Andrew Yang:](https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1236093169898582017)

&gt;Holy crap I just heard that a feature documentary about the campaign that includes hundreds of hours of early footage is being prepared for next year!  That is going to be quite a trip."
5057,"I'm calling a Biden Warren ticket. The whole Native American thing is going to hurt, but there is a net good getting the progressives on board. We need to take this to Trump hard"
5058,"Very true.

Tbf they ran the literal worst candidate and dem turnout was massive and it barely won haha"
5059,Heck yes! Can‚Äôt wait to cast my vote tomorrow!
5060,You can support Biden without misrepresenting Bernie.
5061,"&gt;Sure, you may argue that Biden is the lesser of two evils

When someone asks you ""Why should I vote for the lesser of two evils?"", there's a simple answer:

*Because the alternative is the greater of two evils.*"
5062,Very dangerous set of supporters. Biden will have trouble uniting the democrats

5069,"Vote for the man, not the party"
5070,Saint Obama. A man too good for this country's sins.
5071,"What policies of his are progressive, that progressives aren't talking about?

What qualities does he have that will allow him to institute his plans?"
5072,The trick is to never open it
5073,"This is... a lot. It's a big question. I guess I'd start with saying that they have fundamentally different views on how politics is supposed to work.

Joe thinks politics is about relationships and bringing people together. He wants to find a way to get as many people on-board with an idea and then work with everybody to make it happen. He favors making changes that are broadly popular with the American people, common sense things that everybody can support.

Bernie thinks that politics is about demanding radical change. He wants to make the moral argument for the way things should be and then challenge people who do not agree. He believes in laying out a marker and saying, ""this is where we must be, and we must go there right away.""

Folks like myself who have ended up here would defend Joe's methods by pointing out that the structure of government, the way it works, the way power is divided and votes are taken, makes Bernie's methods impossible to actually achieve. That his demands are counter-productive, and even if he were president, they wouldn't get done.

Bernie's supporters would counter that you have to push for as much as possible, you can't ""compromise before the fight."" They would say anybody who is turned off by their aggressive tactics wouldn't have voted for the idea anyway, so they don't matter. They would say there's no compromising in a crisis.

Hopefully that's a moderately fair high-level view of the philosophy behind their specific plans."
5074,"No offense to Joe, I really wouldn‚Äôt want him going beyond 1 term. We need youth again. It won‚Äôt be in 2020, but it will help in 2024."
5075,"I would put Yang in charge of all the digital national security stuff that is being ignored but really is bigger threat than nuclear war in my opinion. Let Yang be a guide to the Bye-Don team with social media and trade craft in the short term too. He really hacked the primary in my opinion and has talent with social media engineering. And then he can teach me how to open a pdf, Jack."

5078,I think it's the best chance we have. [John Oliver did a segment on it](https://youtu.be/7Z2XRg3dy9k) and covers most of my points.
5079,"Biden is a fucking pedo, don't know how anyone supports that guy."
5080,"I disagree. The path to election isn't to pander to those who'd write in Bernie in the GE. The path to being elected sits on moderate never Trumper Republicans and independents. And you won't get those by making big promises, being hyperpartisan and alienating people. 

And if those ""progressives"" would rather have four more years of Trump than Joe, they can't call themselves progressives anymore. If you pick regress over slight progress, you're entiteled and probabaly not even a progressive for the betterment of the country but personal gains."

5087,"That‚Äôs not really a compelling argument, sorry.  Especially considering how the last campaign with the strategy of a ‚Äúmassive turnout‚Äù ended up actually going."
5088,Worth mentioning that NE-2 is a toss up as well. And that ME-2 unfortunately leans red.
5089,"Reddit is so in the tank for Bernie. Any kind of honest question or counterpoint just gets downvoted into oblivion and the left-wing haters (real or proxy) come out en force. 

Just remember that there are more of us - more quiet moderates out there - than there are Bernie fanatics. We gotta unite and mobilize, and welcome everyone- from the far left to the reasonable right, to this campaign. 

Long way to go before the convention. We can do this!"
5090,Do you genuinely have ideological opposition to people being able to declare bankruptcy on all their debt? Do you genuinely wish you voted for Bernie or Trump?

5093,"The Democratic base would attract a lot more voters by being rational on the issue of guns. Most gun owners would be open to solutions but ones that actually make sense. The AWB did nothing to curb crime. It actually increased under the AWB. Guns aren't deadlier because they look scarier.  
  
Gun ownership is also a right that has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the Supreme Court. Attacking gun owners, when there are so many of them in America, is a sure way to lose to Trump. I already know two people that stopped voting Democrat because they have gone from a party supporting rational gun rights to supporting no gun rights."

He then came out in support of same-sex marriage during the Obama administration and has been in support until this day. It seems to me that Joe Biden is willing to sway in whichever way the democratic establishment (or billionaire donors for that matter) seems fit. Siding with what the democratic leadership wanted in 1996, and following what democratic leadership wants today, even though those two are polar opposite opinions on the same issue."

5126,"&gt; Something health-wise will happen to Biden before the convention. (IMO, this is the worst thing to base his reasoning on from a moral standpoint)

Even if something should happen to Biden, I think Bernie's supporters are dead wrong in assuming he'd be the default choice.   
  
Maybe I'm mistaken, but should that happen, another ""moderate"" candidate, or Joe's VP pick, would continue on so that Bernie would not get enough delegates to pass the majority. And then Biden's previously assigned delegates would choose that candidate, resulting in their nomination at the convention.   
  
Bernie's only hope would be that the ""moderate"" candidates would all jump back in, splitting the vote. But they've already shown that (unlike Bernie) they value unity and are willing to self-sacrifice.   
  
My guess would be, should anything happen to Joe, Obama would do some behind the scenes organizing (assuming this hasn't already been decided) with the possible successors and they would publicly endorse a new ""Unity Candidate"".   
  
Bernie supporters would cry foul while the rest of the party sees as clear as day that 60-80% of the party has chosen ""Not Bernie."""

Reagan and the GOP had done a good job painting the Dems as ""Tax and Spend"" so they need to counter with pragmatism. I think it would be much in the context of Obama and sequestration.  No Dem has ever spoken of taking away Soc Sec, Medicare or Medicaid. These are hard fought for cornerstone legislation of the Dem party.  General rule of thumb look at the long track record. All politics is local too.  Booker who is very progressive needs to be careful with pharma legislation because its such a huge industry in NJ.

The propaganda against Hillary was a lot further established this time last primary; Im pretty sure the notorious label of ""Crooked Hilary"" was already in play during super Tuesday.  But there's still a lot of time for the Joe Biden smear campaign to evolve and you can't underestimate how rotten the GOP, Russia, and sadly a small group of resentful progressive-socialist will get.  It will be NASTY.  I'm not taking for granted the fact that Biden can still be branded as negatively as Hillary was.  People are not well informed; people have short memories.  But, I'm staying cautiously optimistic!  So far, we've done an amazing job at resisting and countering the propaganda. And, unpopular opinion, Bloomberg is a genius with data with practically unlimited money.  If he invests in social media targeting the way he's indicated, I think his operation alone could counter Russia and right wing online groups."

5171,"Was curious, looked her up, sounds like a twat. 

Born and raised in India to a wealthy Indian family, moves to the US and is ‚Äúshocked‚Äù at the poverty. Gets a PhD in economics and becomes a socialist (???) and an economics professor (??!?!?!) at a handful of schools in the Seattle area. She‚Äôs a huge proponent for rent control which any economist will tell you is a horrible move, so now I fear for the education people are getting in Seattle haha. 

She was elected to her seat in 2013 and received zero political endorsements but a handful of celebrity endorsements (shocking). 

She‚Äôs extremely anti-Israel, which for some reason she as a city council member has an opinion on. Also, I don‚Äôt understand how this has become a politicized thing where the far left hates Israel, maybe someone can explain it to me. 

It also looks like she‚Äôs getting a lot of criticism for putting herself and her policies above the people she represents, hardly ever being in Seattle. Also another trait of the far left I‚Äôll never understand. I‚Äôd love to know how much work Bernie and AOC have done for their constituents. 

&gt;  The Seattle Times, in their endorsement of Banks, said the City Council ""isn't a job for an ideologue"" and that ""the District 3 seat is more than a podium"", that it ""needs a collaborative leader to work with other districts and balance resources and investment.""[42]

She‚Äôs also responsible for annoying shit like this:

&gt; Sawant called for a ""wave of protests and strikes"" on May Day, including ""workplace actions as well a mass civil disobedience that shuts down highways, airports, and other key infrastructure.""[68

I‚Äôd love to know how many of her supporters are in Seattle because of the tech book and are 100% in the position they are in life due to the success of capitalism.

5193,"Sanders never actually tanked his numbers, more so the democratic moderates are no longer fragmented. 

It's painfully evident our primary system can be exploited by radical populists. The primary voters are statistically more politically active than general election voters, so you can bet the \~30% of the more extreme voters are going to show up and pick the most radical candidate. Most years, there are two or three ""radical"" candidates that split that 30%. Now, there's one candidate, comically far right or far left, that swoops up all of those votes. 

So while moderates are fragmented, and while only 30% of voters support the radical candidate, people like Sanders and Trump can win state after state in the primary."

I never heard that. 

Can you prove that? Otherwise I can't believe it. 

I did hear that if democrats are too right-wing, people just go with the republican, like they did the last time. 

It doesn't seem centrists learned the lesson of 2016. 

Centrist democrats still don't seem to realize that running center-right candidates doesn't serve the people who want left-wing candidates.  

When left-wing people stay home because there are no left-wing candidates, the democrats lose.

At least 3 notable outlets have outright declared Joe the winner (New York Times, Washington Post snd Vox)"

5238,"I was watching that town hall live.  When he opened up like that and made himself vulnerable in the name of helping others overcome too, that‚Äôs when I went from just thinking he was the better option to beat Trump to loving the man.  

That moment first gave me goosebumps, then made me cry.   Almost tearing up just thinking about it."
5239,"Oh noooooooo, poor Bernie. Darn it."
5240,"Did she not call on him to break his NDA with McKinsey? Violating that agreement prematurely would result in them suing him. He‚Äôd lose, and would be crushed by financial debt for the rest of his life. She knew that, and she pushed forward anyway. 


That is evil."

5243,"I really liked her, but she just never got the momentum she needed. Her surprise surge in New Hampshire was incredible, but the coverage of her surge was drowned out by all the people pissed off about the coverage of someone other than Sanders"
5244,That‚Äôs one reason the switch from Pete to Biden was an easy choice to make
5245,Plenty of options to donate and poll for her. Which they didn't
5246,I was convinced by my weird family to be hardcore Ron Paul. Didn't even know what he really stood for. I would have been a Obama gal too if I hadn't been tricked. I was only 17 and didn't vote but I did go out and canvas and stuff. Smh
5247,"If my math is right there are 663 delegates on deck for tomorrow 

That‚Äôll put us at around 2/3 of the voting done 

With Biden‚Äôs home state yet to come, along with Georgia 

If Bernie gets swept tomorrow, he really ought to pack it in 

He should have packed it in last week, then nobody would be exposed tomorrow"

5258,"You seem upset Progress, you wanna talk about it?"
5259,"Joe's plan is to boost the ACA and Medicaid and offer an option to those that want to buy into the current Medicare program at a slightly increased cost vs. getting the option later.

It's the actual Medicare program buy in, while Medicaid covers the poor.

Not a complete takeover of Medicare and then rebuilding it.I

Which is a lot easier 2 reform what is, than creating something new. And the Medicare program is pretty solid. Which will give it more power to contain costs.

Same is true for the drug markets.

Because the new setup and redo of the ACA, Medicaid and Medicare allow those with administration and insurance jobs 2 keep them, which allows for a stronger economy.

Also we don't have to buy out everything, not cover everything, not deal with complete governmental control.

Which makes Medicare for those that want it cheaper, because of the retained systems. Also making it more realistic to pass Congress. Basically using the existing structure to enhance vs. completely wiping out the system and going for full control.

Any more questions?"
5260,We've already seen all the shit you've been talking and we're not voting for Biden. Enjoy four more years of Trump.
5261,"The delegate difference is minimal, but a clean sweep of states is just crushing."
5262,"Joe Biden supports racial justice and has for decades. A long time ago, he opposed bussing, while still supporting the goal of desegregation. He had been in favor of bussing while running, and was caught of guard by a backlash to bussing in his state. he saw it as his job to represent the views of his constituents. Was it the best thing? No. Hundreds of black leaders have forgiven him for this, so bringing this up is pretty pointless. He is left of Obama politically. Obama picked him to have someone with more experience on the ticket, as well as to appeal to blue collar voters in the rust belt. Jesse Jackson made an extremely bigoted comment. I‚Äôm not saying that he hates all Jews, but the prejudice is there. Also, Bernie has been endorsed by scores of antisemites, so all that says is that they‚Äôre normal bigots who hold bigoted opinions, rather than complete extreme bigots who want to engage in a campaign of genocide. How many racists say ‚ÄúWell, not all of them‚Äù, after making a racist statement. The answer is a lot. That‚Äôs basically where Jesse Jackson is, as well as several other notable antisemites who support him, such as Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Linda Sarsour, and Cornell West."

5267,"When people are scared they will flock to where they see any semblance of leadership of any sort, even if it is poor leadership. That is why Trump's approval of handling the crisis has gone up even though he has undoubtedly made it worse.

If Biden starts acting like he is the presumptive nominee people will flock to him, even Sanders supporters."
5268,I don't think debates have that much of an impact on voters as you think.   Hillary in my opinion won all of them and it still didn't matter much.    It is political thunderdome for tv.  Both sides will blame the other for having dementia.   Joe can demolish Trump and the other side might see something completely different.  Trump is wondering if he can skip the debates.

I love that I can still sit here like ""Well, when Pete was still running, he used to do XYZ and I think Joe should too"" or ""oh you were a Beto backer?? God, I love him, that speech he gave at ABC that time was amazing"" without someone getting in my face and screaming at me for mentioning other candidates.

5277,"Ability to grow as a person and admit mistakes is a key quality we need in the next President. I'm disappointed it won't be Warren, Harris, Klobuchar, Yang, Williamson or Clinton, but I'm relieved that Biden is ready and willing to serve."

I swore in the Military(just waiting to graduate high school in May) so my healthcare will be paid either way, but when I get out and my healthcare thru work is great I want to keep it, and if I fall on hard times I can go thru his Medicare for all structure. Also community college free. After my service I‚Äôd def take advantage of that so I could kick out first two years of college with the basic classes and use the GI Bill for actual university, and it‚Äôll help folks not get in to much debt."
5288,"&gt; That is not representative of Bernie AT ALL, which just irritates me more because they feel entitled to speak for someone i respect so much and who would definitely condemn such remarks.

[Condemn?  He gives *paychecks* to people who make such remarks.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/03/sanders-promised-civility-hired-twitter-attack-dog/585259/)

He doesn't say that democrats want poor people to die from lack of healthcare or accuse them of being corrupt but he pays people to say it for him.  In my mind that is a heck of a lot worse.  If he really believes those things, he should say them.  If he doesn't believe them he is paying people to hurt progressive causes because it helps his own brand."
5289,"Exactly. It's a huge campaign, probably by Russia, to create apathy and suppress the Democratic voters most likely to believe it's all rigged or there's some grand conspiracy against them to get them to vote Green, or not at all"
5290,"Bernie chose not to do the right thing for his own supporters today.

So instead of admitting that he has lost three Tuesdays in a row and has no path forward, he will keep taking their money and flying his private jet.  How shameful."

5302,"No, we need someone with serious experience as a chief executive"
5303, a lot of people are ignoring bernie at this point. biden can still win the general without bernies supporters. For example he can convince republican moderates to vote for him
5304,Not to mention how much Leslie would LOVE Pete!
5305,Biden is more progressive in the sense that he actually makes progress.
5306,"Too old for who though?

Young people were big fans of Sanders and Warren who are also quite old. Plus not picking a younger person ties into Biden's core message of uniting experienced leaders to bring the country back on track."
5307,Glad to see you willing to cross the lines.  I‚Äôm also still not convinced that the (up until recently) success of the stock market has as much to do with Trump as it does the foundation Obama laid down combined with institutional inertia that‚Äôs resisted Trump‚Äôs best efforts to screw stuff up (such as his constant efforts to start a trade war with China).
5308,"Me too, I‚Äôll be out on Sunday"
5309,"Here's the deal, Biden supporters. There's a very low chance of Bernie supporters voting for Biden. Bernie supporters have to choose between 4 more years of devestation or 8 more years of moderate mess.

Nor Biden or Trump will do jack shit about medicare or climate change so we won't be able to wait 8 years instead of 4.

As seen in the Young Turks, Ball said she is an ""undecided voter"" because ""if they always can say, 'Look, you've got to vote for us no matter what, you've got no other choice,' then they're always going to treat us like this.""

The DNC is continuously treating Bernie and Bernie supporters like shit and they are done with it. They need a progressive candidate, even if that means 4 more years of suffering, but Bernie supporters are more than ready to bite the bullet."
5310,They think all the newspapers and other media who were unanimous about Biden prevailing in the last one (though most said Bernie did quite well also) are all bought and shilling for Joe

What‚Äôs more important, your partisan hackney or the lives of your fellow Americans?"
5324,"&gt; If you believe the latter, congratulations you believe in Medicare for All. Likewise if you don't believe in Medicare for All, you believe the former.

Not true at all. I believe in universial healthcare. And there are many paths to get there. Either by using a multipayer system, single payer system or a mixture of them to achieve that. Bernie's M4A is just *one* proposal and not even a good one IMO.

&gt; As I'm sure you're aware, he was protesting for civil rights before either of us were born. He's keenly aware of the disproportionate effects that capitalism has on black and brown people and has talked repeatedly about ending the prison industrial complex. By ""ignoring intersectionality"" the only thing I can possibly imagine you mean is that he didn't use the right buzzwords, which basically all I ever hear from people who make that argument.

No, what he does is that he is class reductionist. As is his staff and a lot of his supporters. Fixing a system with inherent racism can't just be reduced to pretty talks about the working class, especially when large parts of this ""working class"" are middle class white people who are just in it for a potential student loan forgiveness. 

I'd also like to point out that Bernie's staffers and a lot of people in his campaign have no problem calling black people not black enough or ""low information voters"". Do yourself a treat and look up the video of local Bernie supporters literally invading a pro Pete event by black people from South Bend and how they treat those people. 

&gt; This is the kind of thing that makes me seriously doubt that you are actually a democratic socialist. The media bias against Bernie specifically and the left in general has been so obvious it could be seen from space.

Idc what you think of me, tbh. The media did spent months on talking about how badly Biden performed, they harped on Pete's lack of support from minorities, they literally brought up every single piece of dirt they could on all the candidates sans Bernie. 

There was no harsh interview, no big panel shows talking about how bad he was, basically no negative coverage at all. And yeah, you could call that ""Bernie Blackout"", but I call that shitty media running on clicks and likes. Bernie wasn't in the headlines because he said nothing that wouldn't just be a repeat of 2016 coverage. 

And no, you bringing up a few incidences of this don't show me that the media is in it against Bernie. It just shows me what I already knew, that the media in the US sucks. It sucks for every party involved equally."
5325,Please tell me how he looked sick?? Or were you too busy blabbing about how amazing how Joe was while lying about SuperPACs
5326,"Are you honestly suggesting that spending a week trying to explain to everyone that ""actually Castro did some cool things too"" *isn't* a good way to win over voters?"
5327,"Kinda feels like a trailer for a movie. Kinda like Star Wars. The leading figures in the rebellion having a speech in front of everyone who will fight in a crazy mission, like blowing up the death star, and saying ""The days of the empire is going to be over!"", and everyone cheering."
5328,"They are not the same kind of argument. I believe the argument against Amy is much more applicable.

The Kamala-cop line of criticism comes from her professional choices and values that question her commitment to the Democratic vision, not that she is unfit to handle the office. 

Amy‚Äôs line of criticism is that she is very temperamental with an inability to cope or be the bigger person, which is a fundamental flaw in her ability to assume the responsibility of the presidency."
5329,"I think Biden is exactly where he needs to be on the spectrum.

If Warren wanted the VP spot, she had to endorse Biden when she dropped.  She hasn't, and after tomorrow, the primaries are largely done if they go the way pollsters indicate."
5330,a lot of people are pledging not to vote or vote for Trump
5331,"I haven't seen a thread on it personally (thank god) but the folks at the Pete subreddit said Pete &amp; Chasten's phone number got doxed yesterday, too. Fucking assholes are really testing my Rules of the Road civility right now."
5332,Could someone give me a copypasta of the article? Paywalled.

5338,"Thank you for the well thought out posts. I first want to say that you are right in that Bernie is responsible for those on his team who perpetuate any hate. My gut tells me that more vetting could have helped, but that isn't an excuse for why they are still there. 

I believe Bernie can compromise, as ultimately he may have to sacrifice some of plans to get his major ones through. Bernie seems to attract those who have an axe to grind with the establishment. Those people seem to spew hate toward anyone with a differing opinion. 

Ultimately, a lot of Bernie's beliefs are my own...and that is why he is the candidate for me. I understand not everyone will feel that way. I definitely understand why you are voting for Joe and respect it. I never intended to come here to change anyone's mind and I hope those who have down voted my previous post to hell realize that my intent was not to convert anyone. It's to start a discussion to hopefully bring our two sides together. That's why I was saying both sides need to take chill pill, the level of hate seems to be rising and we should all be above that.

Hopefully at the end of the day be it Joe or Bernie we can all be under 1 roof together to stop Trump. That's all I want."

I kind of feel like she serves a greater purpose staying in the senate where she can actually help whip votes and bring progress to the ideals she upholds. She is an incredibly brilliant woman, and I think she realizes she would be most effective where she is. Just an opinion though. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
5350,Agreed. I actually admire the hell outta their passion. We'd be well served to have one or two over here.
5351,"Bernie supporters in large voted, its a myth they didn't.  Bernie helped suppress the overall vote by implying HRC was corrupt.  Plenty of reasons why HRC didn't win, perfect storm situation.  But there is no evidence to put the blame on Bernie voters and I'm saying this as a anti Bernie person.  A vocal minority does not speak for the majority."
5352,"Obama was a moderate, Bill Clinton was a moderate. Your post makes no sense."
5353,I think they are testing the waters to delay and manipulate the election in November.
5354,I really think that emphasizing how crucial it is to elect a democrat because of the Supreme Court is a good way to go. I don't think there's that many Bernie supporters that will switch to trump. Just a lot that will stay home or vote green party. If we can make it about the judges and stress why that is so important I really think alot of the Bernie people that genuinely care will do the right thing.
5355,Thanks. I hope you guys heed my warnings carefully. I believe impeachment politically was the wrong move
5356,You know the....you know the thing!!!
5357,"Remember when the guy showed off that scar, and then someone found an Instagram post on his profile saying he got it from a playground swing like a year prior?"

He feels that he'd have a much bigger impact than being tied down in a mayor position.

&amp;nbsp;

He has inspired many people to run for office off of UBI now and the next election, I believe every candidate will have to answer regarding their stance on UBI. There's a lot of momentum with UBI currently as well from 0% to 55% recognition and high approval amongst young voters.

&amp;nbsp;

I completely agree with you that we need a Dept of Tech which Bill Clinton did away with. I feel America has so much potential except we're kneecapping ourselves and are behind the times when it comes to technology.

&amp;nbsp;

If Andrew Yang becomes Biden's VP pick, he would pull in a lot of progressives from the Bernie and Warren camp imo and easier to work with than Bernie or Warren in that sense.

&amp;nbsp;

I've just been wondering around tbh and finally looked at Biden, so I was curious about Biden's subreddit with how small it is. I was surprised by how respectful this sub is compared to other subs and just reminded me of how nice it is that this sub and the Yang sub allow for open discussion. :)"

***You can't assess the performance of presidency by stock market, it's a stupid thing to attribute when things are good and it's a stupid thing to attribute when things are bad***

Voters are pretty smart dude.  That's something you Bernie folk just don't seem to get."

5398,"Yes, this. Exactly this."
5399,"Oh absolutely. Many people who voted for trump deeply regret doing so and are looking for a big tent candidate, *not* an extremist socialist candidate. 

I fundamentally disagree with sanders policy broadly, but I also love Joe as a person and his platform, if you dig into his policy it‚Äôs truly fantastic. 

I would fundamentally disagree with the Clinton comparison, this comment by /u/Statistical_Methods sums it up way better than I have though on that point:

&gt; The fundamental difference is that Clinton behaved divisively.

&gt; The election was hers to lose, yet she called people ‚Äúdeplorable,‚Äù and ignored her traditional base who were suffering.  She came off as elitist, and was.  It wasn‚Äôt her positions.  It was her.

&gt; That‚Äôs where Joe Biden is so different.  Hillary hadn‚Äôt driven a car since the 1990s.  Joe not only drives, but chooses to ride Amtrak.  Joe graciously received both Buttigieg and Klobuchar yesterday.  Beto took him to Whataburger for dinner.

&gt; Joe is the real thing.  In an era of the anger and hatred, it‚Äôs refreshing.

&gt; Pete had to stand up to Sanders about the homophobic attacks the campaign launched against him.  Sanders wouldn‚Äôt apologize or even acknowledge them.

&gt; There‚Äôs a reason why Pete is not only supporting Biden, but Joe wants him in his cabinet.

5403,"&gt; And, even as we respond to this crisis, we must prepare for the next one. As President, Biden will establish and manage a permanent, professional, sufficiently resourced public health and first responder system that protects the American people by scaling up biomedical research, deploying rapid testing capacity, ensuring robust nationwide disease surveillance, sustaining a first class public health and first responder workforce, establishing a flexible emergency budgeting authority, and mobilizing the world to ensure greater sustained preparedness for future pandemics.

5411,"I don't think a president Bernie could ram through whatever he wanted. I think starting a negotiation as far left as possible ensures that the resulting compromise is sufficiently ambitious - but anyway, I'm hoping that moderates and republicans don't shift the debate in the general too far right of center if Biden is attempting to unify everyone."

5425,"&gt; So individual corporations cannot donate to candidates, but corporations can donate to super pacs who can then give money to the candidate or run ads for them?

Almost. The SuperPACs can't give money to the candidate, but they can run ads designed to help the candidate (explicitly promoting them by name, or attacking their opponent) as long as they follow certain rules about not coordinating with the campaigns.

One of the things I most dislike about Bernie's campaign is the way he has intentionally confused people about how money carries power into politics, all to give him some cheap attack/applause lines against opponents who are in many cases equally or more clean than he is when it comes to illicit financial support. He could have used this opportunity to educate people about how it really works rather than just looking for every possible angle to paint his Democratic opponents as corrupt."
5426,"Fun fact, Pete could run for President in 2060 and he'd still be younger than Sanders is now"
5427,"Bernie absolutely was not defeated that night... Joe was. He didn't have a good answer for anything, and he looked like a buffoon; Trump would make him look really stupid. Joe needs to retire. Especially after this past week of being absent. Voting for Biden would be ridiculous.

Really though, the overwhelming consensus is that Biden was already picked by the Democratic party before this debate. You people already decided that anything Bernie says is just Socialist nonsense and can be disregarded, and you already decided that anything Biden say is golden and presidential. It's crazy how little press Bernie gets.. even when he wins, the headlines are ""Sanders wins, but we're looking at Buttigieg"" Or ""Biden gets second place, but here's why he'll win..."". Then as soon as Joe won a single primary (South Carolina) the media was all ""well, Bernie stands no chance, he should just drop out now."" People who only pay attention to the news hear that and automatically assume that Bernie can't win, so they automatically go for Biden. It's a trap, and you fell for it. This DNC was called before it even began, just like last time. Enjoy another 4 years of Trump."

5458,"I used 4 rounds of qualifiers to add credence to safety of each state. First I turned them all as toss up states, then began investigating each state's activity. There are four levels of security: Safe, Likely, Leans, Tilt.

**1st Qualifier**:

Looked at the voting record of each states past five choices, weighted towards their current three choices in past elections. This gives more credence to the changing demographics and avoids a conflict between Likely vs Tilt. Therefore party security depends on:

* Safe: 5 wins / 3 current wins
* Likely: 4 wins / 3 current wins
* Leans: 3 wins / 3 current wins
* Tilt: 2 wins / 3 current wins

**2nd Qualifier**

While looking at the winning records, attention was also paid to the percentage that each party got voters. This lead to a rule: If winning party is below percentage threshold in any of the three current wins, they are deducted one tier of security. If the winning party is above percentage threshold in any of the three current wins, they are lifted one tier up. Therefore party security depends on:

* Safe: 60-100%
* Likely: 56-59%
* Leans: 52-55%
* Tilt: 45-51%

**3rd Qualifier**

After looking at the history, I then looked at the most currently available state polls provided by 270towin. This lead to another rule. If winning party conflicts with with current polls, they are deducted one tier of security, with the opposite being true for favorable polls.

For example, If Alabama voted red for 5 elections, and at least 60% in the three most current, but polls show Biden leading, Trump would be deducted to Likely in the state.

**4th Qualifier**

This looked at the 2016 election and the results. Like the polls, if the winning party conflicts with the 2016 vote, they are deducted one tier of security, with the opposite being true for favorable voting results.

For example, If Alabama's show Biden leading, Trump is deducted to Likely, but if the 2016 election voted for him, then he is lifted to Safe."
5459,"Im glad you responded, but you gotta read the whole interview and tell me if your opinion changed. Plz reply I really wanna know if you look at that quote differently thanks. 

 Biden: ‚Ä¶I only had two political heroes in my whole life ‚Äî and this is not new, I‚Äôve said this since 1972 ‚Äî Dr. \[Martin Luther\] King and Robert Kennedy. And up to that point there was a war raging, there was a bitter fight over even whether we should talk about the environment, women were still viewed as second-class citizens and not prepared to have significant jobs ‚Äî thought that. And we were told ‚Äî people didn‚Äôt talk to one another over the war ‚Äî and we were told ‚ÄòDrop out, go out to Haight-Ashbury, get engaged.‚Äô You know, shortly after I graduated in ‚Äô68, Kent State, 17 kids shot dead. And so, the younger generation now tells me how tough things are ‚Äî give me a break! \[Audience laughs and applauds\]. No no, I have no empathy for it. Give me a break. Because here‚Äôs the deal, guys ‚Äî we decided we were going to change the world, and we did. We did. We finished the civil rights movement to the first stage. The women‚Äôs movement came into being. So my message is ‚ÄòGet involved.‚Äô There‚Äôs no place to hide. You can go out and you can make all the money in the world, but you can‚Äôt build a wall high enough to keep the pollution out. You can‚Äôt not be diminished when your sister can‚Äôt marry the man or woman, the woman she loves. You can‚Äôt ‚Äî when you have a good friend being profiled ‚Äî you can‚Äôt escape this stuff. And so, there‚Äôs an old expression my philosophy professor would always use, from Plato: The penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves.

5480,"A lot of it has to do with how manufactured her political career was.

After a NY senator announced his retirement, she purchased a home in NY so she could run for Senate. She grew up in Chicago and then lived in Arkansas and bought a home in New York only to be able to run. She'd never held public office before, and won largely on Bill's coattails.

A lot of people also (correctly) predicted that the Senate run was merely to build a resume to run for President later. Of course she got defeated in her first primary by Obama.

When the 2016 primaries rolled around, and her campaign was considering using ""It's Her Turn"" as one of their slogans. Not sure how word got out, but I definitely remember that phrase going around. That slogan obviously fed into the idea that her candidacy had been something she and other party insiders were working on building probably since early on in Bill's administration. It also had a very entitled air of ""If Bill got to be President, it's only fair I get to be President too."""
5481,Well a lot of this is state level.  SO we would need either to use an executive order claiming national security or to win the Senate.  So yes we need to hold them accountable but first we need to hold one another accountable to go out and vote/volunteer to make sure we win the Presidency and the Senate.
5482,This has been nothing if not a wild ride.
5483,"I cannot *believe* how much invective Sanders supporters directed against Elizabeth Warren.

Elizabeth Warren represents every good characteristic of the progressive movement I can possibly think of. Her principles are rock-solid, and her plans are strong. And where they're not strong, she's willing to change her policies to make them better. I admire that intensely.

But just because she wasn't *their guy,* the Bernie Bros treated her and her supporters terribly. That's reprehensible.

It should have been Elizabeth Warren running against Biden. She fights hard, but she and her supporters fight clean and fight fair. She deserves the VP slot‚Äîand if Bernie's constitutional lawyers were right about it being legal, she deserves Treasury Secretary at the same time too."
5484,It would further nationalize the race
5485,Who is Bernie?
5486,"Conservatives may be more closely aligned to Democrats, but Boris Johnson is still a problem.  He‚Äôs Trump-Lite.  New Labour was where it‚Äôs at.  Clinton and Tony Blair were bros until Clinton left office and Bush had Blair by the balls over Iraq."

5492,"We should never get complacent. Joe's campaign wants to focus on issues and Trump because he knows the race to beat Trump started the day he took office, and as soon as our nominee is decided, we must all start hammering the message that Trump has to go. So the campaign offices Joe has started opening, the staff being hired, the ads being made and run, the rallies being held, these are the first salvo of the general election."
5493,"I thought this forum was actually a safe place for bernie sanders supporters to come and get information about Biden and his policies, etc. But when you stumble on this thread and see the comments, its disappointing. 
OP should be ashamed. 

You realize that Bernie is not trying to hurt his friend Joe. As hes said numerous of times. Hes just explaining how different they are. Trump in the past 4 years isnt normal. All of his cabinet are corrupt. So by Bernie stating that they dont want to go back to normal he is stating that things wont change by going back to normal. Trump is the decline, Biden states hes the normal. Bernie states hes the change in this perspective. Although what you guys think or anyone thinks that's true or not true. It doesn't matter.

This thread shouldn't exist because the rest of the forum here is just uplifting. This contradicts your guys message of unity."
5494,"I'd recommend watching the new documentary about her.

I felt similarly, but then I saw she had been getting shit for how she dressed, not taking her husbands name, having a real job, since the early 80's.

But ths is why we all need to get involved and give Trump his eviction notice.    i haven't been involved with 2020 election process until this moment because i knew once a nominee was picked, then i would give my all to dump Trump.  i think there are a great number of Americans who are thinking along the same line.

5502,"&gt; If you can entertain the premise, and understand that I think Bernie has near zero clout with the DNC superdelegates, lobbyists, and the DNC platform committee, then maybe my thinking won't seem like a looney conspiracy theory.

It is a conspiracy, though. ""The Establishment"" is to Sanders and his supporters what ""The Deep State"" is to Trump and his: a conspiracy meant to explain away things not going the way they wanted them to."

She basically needed what Yang has done, which is introduce it into the public discussion so it's not a completely new idea during an election -- basically what Sanders did for M4A in 2016 so now it's being debated seriously.

Now imagine what happens if we get a cash stimulus for the coronavirus. We've got UBI in the public consciousness plus a bunch of cash going out to everyone and people might start to want that money every month."

Under the Biden plan, healthcare would be universal, everyone under 140% of the poverty line would get free healthcare, everyone else could opt in to a government run plan that costs a maximum of 8.5% of your income for coverage, copays, everything. . (Today the average American pays 15-20% of their income for healthcare)

Additionally, there would be:

An end to surprise fees

Price control on drugs like insulin

Allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices

Allow providers to purchase foreign made drugs.

So yes, Bidens plan is universal"

5517,"Former Pete supporter.  The day after he dropped out, I wrote a long-winded post on /r/SandersForPresident about how they needed to change their tone and adopt the ""Rules of the Road"" from Pete's campaign.  The post was well received and Sanders' supporters were generally cordial -- I do believe the toxic aspect of his base is a vocal minority and a portion of it is trolls pretending to be supporters.  The major point I was trying to make in suggesting that they adopt the RotR was that this vocal minority was a major vulnerability for Sanders because it drives people away and is an avenue for disinformation.  I got a couple positive comments, no hateful DMs and about 15 upvotes.

The next day, /r/JoeBiden adopted the Rules of the Road without me having to suggest a damned thing.  This was a pivotal moment for me after Pete's exit from the race.  The RotR were something that really separated Pete from the rest of the pack for me.  This sub adopting them really did pull at least one voter into the fold.  Thank you for that.  Go Joe."

5520,"No he‚Äôs actually not ‚Äúclearly on a cognitive decline.‚Äù Sanders is the one who‚Äôs ill-prepared and learned nothing from the 2016 election cycle. Young voters aren‚Äôt reliable. And attacking everyone in your own party as the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù, but then turning around and expecting them to support you is lunacy. He couldn‚Äôt even beat Biden in states he was ‚Äúsupposed to win‚Äù like Maine, Massachusetts, and Minnesota. Biden didn‚Äôt just sweep the south, he won key northern states. 

Bernie wants to blame the corrupt billionaire establishment for his loss which dismisses the voices of countless voters, who he should be trying to bring to his side, not ostracize. On top of that, Biden was BROKE heading into Super Tuesday, many people did mail in voting (BEFORE the endorsements), and Bloomberg siphoned cotes away otherwise it would have been an even bigger blowout in some cases, like Texas. Sanders argument that he is more electable and will turn out more voters was soundly disproven.

His policies are too far left and will never get through Congress, he shows no willingness to compromise either. At least Liz Warren acknowledged that not everyone wanted to lose the health insurance they already have. Bernie is ‚Äúmy way or the highway.‚Äù He‚Äôs divisive and lashed out at the very people he needs to support him in a general election. He would NEVER beat Trump. Face the facts."

I feel he's a bit behind Warren and Bernie on most of our issues, but he's still 1000x better than trump on it so there we are. I still (verbally) bash the fash quite happily though. Biden is...not exactly fash lol, even if he wasn't my first pick."

Joe‚Äôs has an additional section focused on pharmaceutics/drug price regulation I like a lot.  Some snippets from the top of my head:

- Allow importation of prescription drugs
- Repeal law banning the government from negotiating drug prices for public healthcare programs/welfare (eg. Medicare)
- Establish a board to recommend a price for new drugs susceptible to price gouging based on international pricing, prices to be used in private option
- Decrease time to market for generic drugs"

I am very certain that, against Trump, he or any other neoliberal will loose.  
Respectfully I must say: I would never vote for him."

5543,"No you should. 

&amp;#x200B;

That way you get to compare between the circlejerking peak before a voting day, and then the utter cockblocking of the circlejerking after the pro-Biden results come in lol. Super Tuesday was the most prominent example; even after Biden won majority of the states, all you saw were pro-Bernie wins and circlejerks.

&amp;#x200B;

And then when reality sunk in about 2-3 days later after Bloomberg also endorsed Biden, that's when most Bernie bros took a temporary nap off the sub to cool off their meltdown lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Now they are back up at full force again; but watch out for after tomorrow's results. Then on March 17 as well; as it would dawn on them that their massive echo chamber is just.... a puny chamber compared to the vast majority of Americans who don't want the country swinging like a mad pendulum from one end of a political spectrum to another."

5549,I know what you mean. It's a tricky one though. I obviously much prefer civility but I also can't get mad at people for being hostile given how far this country has fallen and how passionately they believe that their candidate is the only hope for actual change.
5550,"A couple examples:

* Obama voted against the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Biden drafted it.
* [Obama ran an antiwar campaign in 2008 and while a Senator](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/26/us/politics/26obama.html), Biden voted for the Iraq invasion.
* Obama was for single payer that eventually ended at universal coverage, while Biden:

&gt; [On October 23 Biden revealed his health care plan. It called for expanded coverage for children and adults but stops short of mandates for complete universal coverage. It aimed to encourage wellness and modernization of treatment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2008_presidential_campaign)"
5551,We don't need a ticket with two septuagenarians
5552,"I got those vibes also, but I can't be 100% sure because I think he retweeted an article attacking joe on education sometime after giving his press conference"
5553,"Maybe it's just because I know relatively little about her, but I found Kamala kind of ""politician-ey"" in the debates to a degree that initially turned me off from her. That ""food fight"" one-liner she used in one of the early debates was just so patronizing and fake-folksy that I pretty much yelled at the TV right after. Also, I found her early attacks on Joe Biden's bussing record to be misleading and ignorant of context. I think she's a very good speaker and a very intelligent person though, and she would be a great VP candidate.

Klobuchar is someone I really liked throughout the whole primary season, and I think she'd be great both as a VP candidate and a VP in office. She might be able to build on some of Joe's Midwestern appeal and has pretty consistently (with some very obvious exceptions) performed well in the debates.

Liz is pretty sharp and can do Biden a lot of favors with progressives, but I think the differences between them are too stark to make them fully compatible as running mates. Also, she's 70 years old, and another 70+ person on the ticket wouldn't endear him to younger voters who lack enthusiasm for him.

I have thoughts on Pete, but there's honestly too many for me to put down right now. Suffice it to say, there are some pros and some cons with him, but I think most of his pros overlap with those of others who may be much stronger choices.

As for the rest, I don't really have any thoughts. I'll say pretty generally, I think Biden benefits from putting someone of a different demographic on his ticket, preferably a woman. He needs someone who's youngish and can make overtures to progressive voters. That might suggest someone like Kamala, or a Kamala-like figure."

5632,"I personally think him dropping out now gives Biden more of a shot, particularly in California. This looks to *increase* the odds of a contested convention, unless a MAJOR change of pace happens yesterday. That‚Äôs just my observation.

I‚Äôm not saying Pete made a bad decision, particularly if he‚Äôs looking to score a cabinet position from whoever he endorses or some other political benefit. And him dropping out definitely helps Biden and Warren more because frankly, they need it right now."
5633,"Agreed.  If the left loses that will be one of the biggest reasons why.  I've been following Bernie since the late 90s (CSPAN!), and I really want him to win.  I don't want him to win at the expense of unity among the left though.  Maybe he's not electable, but at least his presence is drawing attention to the issues we're now talking about.  The fact that Mayor Pete, the first openly gay presidential contender,  did so well is also a clear indication that the LBGT folks *are* electable. Even though Pete is dropping out, he'll always have my admiration for helping to open that door.  Why the Bros feel the need to attack his supporters instead of just his policies is beyond me.  :("

5637,"Yeah, my insomnia's been fairing up these past few days. Es no bueno."
5638,"Bernie's politics are a bottomless pit of expenses and Republicans know it.  Bernie's M4A bill alone could cost $60 trillion (to reiterate: $60,000 billion) over 10 years, that's like 25% of entire our gross domestic product. We could rob the 1% until they're homeless and it still wouldn't pay a bill that large. And forget about ""free college"".

Bernie promises to lower most people's taxes in year one. Then, if he passes all of his plans, he'll bankrupt us all."

5660,"You brought up poor people, not me. Biden's plan is to automatically enroll people that are bellow 138% of the poverty line. I would argue that you can be above that, but still be poor, but you perhaps won't. Does not change the fact that some people will be above this line and still be unable to pay for Biden's plan.

And I do not want to discuss the plans in detail, because it just not productive. I certainly can argue, that I do not believe that Joe Biden would be able to get public option through since he was part of Obama's team and they were not able to push it through, that he is not going to fight for it cause his record proves that he is for social programs only when it is good for him politically and that he will not beat Trump, because of Biden's corruption and mental health. While Sanders on the other hand from the position of a senator was able to get amendments to the Obama healthcare bill. Does argument based on these points seem productive to you?"
5661,"Same it will be very fun and sad to watch. They‚Äôll talk about how ‚Äúrigged‚Äù it is, and they don‚Äôt know anybody that voted for Joe. Like holy shit r/conspiracy theories is proud rn üòÇüòÇ"

5664,"Sanders has been averaging between 30 - 40% of the vote -- call it 35%. According to this poll, 80% of that would be converted to biden, and 20% would be ""lost"".. so let's say that's a loss of 20%\*.35 = or 7%. Of that 20% .. 15% would actually switch, so it's a double-whammy. .15%.35 = 5.25%.  So the actual percentage points lost would be (5.25\*2) + 1.75 = 12.25%. That's significant."
5665,"Warren is a no, the VP needs to be relatively young and there's only a 7 year difference between them. I predict left field."
5666,Bruh in just not a socialist
5667,that is a total non sequitur and has nothing to do with my point. Joe is not a pathological liar and neither is Bernie. producing  a clip to slander someone is not something that either Joe or Bernie would engage in but it's the kind of stuff trump shares on his twitter feed all the time.

However, the fact that the administration Biden was in DID handle epidemics and set the federal govt up to handle it as well as expanded healthcare....and then an opposition party promptly got rid of those things, but couldn't uproot Obamacare, shows that popularity will not prevail."

This was one of my favorite moments of his campaign, got me right in the feels.

If you want to ask me about his policies feel free, a lot of people are surprised how progressive he is, and it is important to remember the efficacy of a policy is not determined by how much money you throw at it."

I think you'll find this page helpful:

5710,"So my personal feeling on this is that private insurance undermines a public option. Private companies are responsible to their share holders and exist as a business meant to profit. They merely use the fact that people will always pay to prolong their lives. Therefore, private insurance charges more than necessary so that they can cover the actual medical expenses while also delivering a profit to owners and shareholders. By keeping them while also having a public option we will likely see that those with wealth maintain their private option and end up not contributing to the public option that the rest of people are stuck with. This will lead to a lesser bargaining position for the public option and possibly plenty of providers simply not accepting that option. This is a situation I‚Äôve already witnessed with ACA. Also, we will still be stuck with the problems of losing coverage when leaving a job or even getting divorced. 

Basically, I think that a single payer system says that individuals should not use the health of others to drive profits. I think that it says that no matter what happens to you, you are entitled to healthcare and that it should not bankrupt you. I think that the existence of private health insurance has placed significant barriers between people and treatment. The only way I see them existing in a moral way is for every single person to pay into a single payer system and a private apparatus could exist on top of that. People would be free to pay extra and hire doctors on their own, but they would not be free to shuck their duty as a citizen to pay into making sure that everyone else had access to healthcare. So I guess, to actually answer your question, I don‚Äôt necessarily see a need to ban it, but rather a ban on paying for private insurance and using that as a reason not to pay into the public option."
5711,i am super uncomfortable with the notion of nominating a white dude *and then picking a white dude for VP bc the first white dude wasn't white enough*.
5712,Michigan will go democrat. As a Michigander I don‚Äôt think there is any way we go for trump

5714,"If she doesn‚Äôt endorse, she gets a cabinet position in either democratic administration. I‚Äôm a bernie supporter but this infuriates me too"
5715,I don't think so. His advisors will not allow it. There is a huge swath of people including the Democratic Party who believe he shouldn't even of ran for president. People would be upset and the backlash would be directed at Pete. If he (Joe) does offer him that position (highly unlikely) I hope he turns it down.
5716,"The only thing we don't know is whether he will do well against a republican opponent. Right now it looks good, and as soon as we start focusing on the general we will get a clearer picture how close things will be or not in the fall. Hopefully he continues to perform with these margins and Trump is decisively rejected just as Sanders is being."

She knows she can do better for the working class working with Biden and actual progressives will back her with enthusiasm. Bernie got nothing done for middle class during great recession, she created CFPB working with Biden and Obama.

So please, this loyalty mindset is not healthy, let the country progress beyond purity tests and online bashing."
5719,"Note: WaPo is a bunch of lying corporate stooges, just like Biden.  That's because Biden is a corporate whore who has been and is a stooge for insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, wall-street and oil &amp; gas. He's a fucking whore who sold his soul for political power and he won't do a damn thing for ANYONE who isn't already rich. He's a fucking loser and a lying bastard who is more of a Reagan Republican that a Democrat. Too bad lots of people are so fucking stupid they think he'll be different than Trump. Biden is the same bastard who has been trying to cut social security, medicare and medicaid. What the fuck is WRONG with people?"

Here is Bernie‚Äôs political party and what they say about it 

https://www.dsausa.org/

&gt; Capitalism pits us against each other and workplaces are fundamentally authoritarian unless workers can self-organize and build collective power. This is why people build unions, and why employers undermine them. It is also why the capitalists as a class constantly promote narratives about unions that frame them as unnecessary, undemocratic, or ineffective. We know better, and we‚Äôre building worker power in every region of the country."
5722,Honestly yes he does. This sort of mentality seems to me like protesting the integration of cars because they'd decimate the horse drawn carriage industry
5723,Not good enough for Sanders supporters.  They want to not have to work at all and have their loans repaid by the tax payer.

They don't have the guts to show up at a Trump rallies."

5733,Well yeah Trump‚Äôs nickname for him is ‚ÄúSleepy Joe‚Äù and when he stands up for himself and shows some passion it hurts Trump (and Bernie‚Äôs) argument that he‚Äôs a tired old man that doesn‚Äôt stand for anything

5737,"I disagree, on some issues Biden is more progressive than Bernie. See for example nuclear power and carbon tax as a means to fight climate change. Bernie wants to cancel existing leases for nuclear power plants and does not have a plan for pricing carbon. 

Biden is more progressive on immigration. While Bernie has changed his stance on it a bit this election cycle, just a couple years ago he was saying that ""immigration is a koch brothers proposal"", and before that he said that immigrants threaten the social safety net.

I would also argue that other policy like healthcare is entirely up for interpretation. Both Biden and Bernie are progressive on healthcare, but are coming at the problem from different directions. At the end of the day, saying one is more progressive than the other on healthcare without discussing specifically what you want from healthcare is a normative statement and not a positive one."
5738,He isn‚Äôt trolling. He is raising valid points. We don‚Äôt want to look like sanders supporters. Be more open to outside viewpoints

5743,"This. I think this debate will be used to unify the party and pivot towards the general. Bernie wants to have a voice after all of this, and a debate is one of the few times Sanders people will get to hear Joe speak unedited, no sound bites, no pundit interpretation. Joe just needs to sell himself well enough."
5744,"I keep seeing Bernie supporters on Twitter attacking Joe for sending old folks to their deaths voting. One blue check Twitter personality said she thought it was an example of how Biden supporters would win because they have less compassion, and then she actually went on to say that she was looking forward to when ""the olds"" that make up Biden's base are gone.

I keep seeing Bernie supporters express anger at the fact that these primary elections are taking place, and repeatedly asking, ""How can they always get away with this?"" I saw so many variations of that same question, and I have to hask, who are *they?* Do Bernie supporters realize that each state manages its own primary, and that there are way more items on the ballot for each state other the than presidential nomination? And yet half of Rose Twitter seems to think this is all directly decided by the DNC.

If Bernie supporters really cared about the health of voters, they would admit that it's time for their candidate to drop out. Bernie mathematically lost a while ago, it is impossible for him to win. Although I don't know him personally, given the anger he has expressed recently, my guess is that he feels very bitterly about his loss, and his decision to stay in the race in a reactionary assertion of control. It seems very emotionally driven, whereas so many other candidates who were also extremely invested in their own campaigns were able to set aside their disappointment and acknowledge reality as soon as it became apparent that their campaigns had no clear path forward. I try to focus on policy when I talk with Bernie supporters, but to me, this is just further proof that Bernie does not have the *temperament* to be President of the United States."
5745,Can anyone here explain to me why this isn't true? I have supported Bernie but I'm thinking about who to support in the General Election. If someone can explain how this tweet isn't true I'll vote for Joe.

5751,"I'm a Virginian, Biden has come out to support down-ballot Democrats in tight elections over and over again. He came down Fall 2019 smack-dab in the middle of his campaign. He's done this across the country. This isn't just with the African American community, but African Americans tend to be politically active so if you're trying to get your local county's Dem elected into the state legislature, and Biden comes out to support you, that's huge. 

This doesn't even begin to get into his support for legislation that supports minorities and his strong personal relationships with prominent African American political leaders."

The odds of the world's best engine sitting in a scrapped piece of shit car are none. You can't cherry pick good things about dictators and act as though these things you like are exclusive of their context. He should be framing these things as new ideas, not pointing out how Castro isn't all that bad, but he won't because he's obsessed with proving that he's been saying this all along and it's hurting, not helping him. He's such a stick in the mud he can't evolve any of his stances from the 70s. Then his followers have to make excuses for him. The man should not be saying this shit in 2020 and he sure as hell should not be defending these comments so passionately. People have made it very clear what they think when he says positive things about authoritarians and he's mad it pretty clear he doesn't care what the American people think, feel, or fear. That does not appeal to me. I'm so sick of being told I ""just don't understand what the old white guy really means"", I'm ready for a president who says wtf he means and stands by it."

And they know what they are doing when they set odds as their business depends on it."
5772,"Yes I 100% agree that she has far more qualifications than Trump and to be fair since he made it into office it‚Äôs not unreasonable for Michelle to be VP (ur very persuasive lol), would she even take it if Biden offered?"
5773,My son posted that and I am as disgusted as you. Though I don't know what your brown shirt comment means.
5774,"Nah, I think maybe its making space for more merchandise. I don't see VEEP Biden announcing his running mate until he secures the nomination. Like some of the users have aforementioned, it'd be seen as cocky and would anger Sanders' base."
5775,"Already posted, sorry"
5776,My post was not anti Sanders. Sanders fans will laugh. Anyone with a sense of humor will laugh
5777,"I think the ‚Äúhealer‚Äù approach is better once we get closer to the general election, but the governors who are breaking through right now aren‚Äôt adopting that approach. Andrew Cuomo and JB Pritzker are demanding action from the President and their citizens and speaking in blunt terms about the crisis.  I‚Äôve seen some shorter videos from Biden today where he strikes a more combative tone‚Äîespecially on the corporate bailout McConnell is pushing‚Äîand I think it suits him. It keeps the base energized, engaged, and angry about the GOP‚Äôs mismanagement of this country as they damn well should be."

5779,"Eh, it's not 41 yet."
5780,"Wait until Sanders will get the rude awakening that a lot of non-Central American (Mexican/Honduran/Salvadorian) migrants are conservative. Not necessarily fake conservative like Trump, but more like Tim Kaine-like. So even with that group he will suck in the general election."
5781,I mean one of Joe‚Äôs current advisors is Ron Klain who served as the United States Ebola response coordinator in 2014 / 2015 for President Obama. Joe truly has surrounded himself with the ‚Äòbest people‚Äô.
5782,yeah political science will tell you that despite the narraives VP choice hardly makes any difference ever
5783,"The democratic platform will be established at the convention, that is what we will run on.

This is what your peers are missing, it isn‚Äôt about Joe - it‚Äôs about the entire party. What made bernie so unelectable was him attacking the party that we all belong to. 

We, as a party, support things like healthcare as a right. Accessible affordable college. Everything you‚Äôre hoping to hear, is going to be in the platform. Minimum wage etc.

Bernie was never, ever, going to do any of these things - the Democratic Party will. When he‚Äôs wag war on the people he needs to implement this platform it‚Äôs just a waste of our time.

What you want, what your friends want - is within the Democratic Party"
5784,"It wasn't that bad, I thought it was mostly an informative debate though I'm not sure having more is useful."
5785,"Absolutely. Even if Biden lost every remaining state tonight, he'd still have a path forward."
5786,"Idk about you, but I saw Pete and Joe referred to as PB&amp;J yesterday and it nearly floored me with joy! I love these names!"
5787,That's a scumbag argument and you know it.
5788,"If you throw out the fact she has been on TV a year straight and ran for president and has had strong debate performances and picked up a 3 place finish for a few delegates and raised a lot of money and has her own donors base, you are right. They are exactly the same."
5789,"""Lets not make this a back and forth about our politics""

During a debate...."
5790,Agreed. In 2016 I would have probably rolled my eyes a little and thought it was cheesy but we are so so so desperately in need of hope and goodness these days it makes me cry now.
5791,"&gt;I did my best haha

Certainly looks like it!"
5792,"Picks like this don't make sense from a winning the election and pushing legislation through perspective.  You really want a VP that can secure a few states in areas you are weak and someone who can drive the agenda through the House and Senate.  Picking her would be akin to picking Joe to help with surgery.   Good person, wrong skill set."
5793,"Maybe, but I reckon he'll stay Mayor of South Bend as it works for his image.

I don't think Biden will do 2 terms and we could see Pete run in 2024"
5794,How the fuck can anyone support Biden?

5797,"This subreddit has got to stop talking about Bernie supporters and how bad/annoying/whatever pejorative word you want they are.

I can show you data from 2008, 2012, and 2016 to show you that ""Bernie or Bust"" did not play a large role in the 2016 election, at least not compared to previous elections.

This is also just preaching to the quire.  If that's the point of this subreddit, to vent about how ""privileged"" (or whatever pejorative word you want) hardcore Bernie supporters are, then I guess have at it.  

If the point is to help Biden and the Democrats to win, then we need to start promoting content that will bring in new eyeballs and expand our presence on Reddit.  Complaining about Bernie supporters isn't going to do it, but again if that's the point of the subreddit then I yield."

5804,"Welcome!

Most of your analysis meshes with my own. The one thing I saw different personally is Warren on medicare for all. To me it appeared that she refused to explain anything in the debates, and that, combined with her lack of detailed foreign policy proposals as contrasted with Biden‚Äôs strength in that area, straightfoward manner, and inspirational rhetoric about what America is and should be, which I didn‚Äôt see from Warren or any other candidate, lead me to switch my support from Warren to Biden in November. I had switched from Castro to Warren in September, and from Warren to Castro in February."
5805,"I saw a huge twitter comment stream about Warren‚Äôs comments regarding how she was treated online. It basically turned into ‚ÄúI cried myself to sleep when I saw it because she‚Äôs a white feminist who doesn‚Äôt care about the issues that really affect people and now Joe Biden is going to win and we will all die.‚Äù

Well. Maybe Bernie Bro‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt have doxxed people in her campaign and flooded her with snakes? I understand Russian interference is a real thing, but there are plenty of real people parroting those things and pushing the horrible comments."
5806,"How far we've come - 2016 had Trump fans attacking the likely Democratic candidate and saying they have mental and physical decline that will soon kill them , 2020, now we have a vocal slice of progressives attacking the likely Dem candidate, saying they have mental and physical decline that will soon kill them. 


Meanwhile, Bernie repeats 1981 stump speech, enters cardiac arrest and then returns ...
Bros :  ""Anyone who doesn't vote for this man ignores the youth and intentionally murders tens of thousands of Americans!"""
5807,I might be next.  This crowd here should down vote the articles and go through the comments a down vote a lot of the comments.  All it takes is 6 votes to block some of them.  I find it odd an story can have 2.7K up votes and only 27 comments.

5809,"That is an entirely fair critique, that maybe the achievements aren't worth of praise. That is an entirely different case than the achievements aren't good because bad people are there. IIRC, their education had a very positive impact with improved healthcare / doctors. But, I don't follow or care that much regarding it.

I don't recall any speeches by any candidate praising these states and using them as an example for a revolution here. I am actually not sure, that there has been any candidate explicitly going out to praise these people either during this campaign. Just when asked about past praise, and answering the question honestly, which is perfectly acceptable."
5810,"Yeah. Whatever they did differently here is what they need to keep up! Maybe he's just well-rested?

eta: He seems to be speaking a bit slower and more deliberately. That might be the big thing."
5811,"Hill-vengers, assemble!"
5812,I think I‚Äôd give Biden 2/3 and Bernie 1/3 against trump. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if Bernie won but I wouldn‚Äôt bet on it.
5813,"Hey, I think they were saying the person you're talking to was being aggro, not you. At least that's how I read it.

Also, hello fellow Yang Gang!

Yang is a perfect example of taking action with his new Humanity Forward project. We can sit around complaining that Congress won't pass UBI, or we can say screw it, we'll make our own UBI with blackjack and hookers. Country isn't there yet on UBI? Fine, raise money, start trials, get the Data^TM, make a stronger case and convince them."
5814,This is the way

5816,"With Patios or Blacks there's no path.

5819,"Man, would I love that... But, I don't think it's a possibility. I think Biden will pick a minority female as his running mate, and if he wins, he'll only serve one term. She will run for President in four years and Pete will be her running mate, so Pete may have to wait 12 years for the White House. He'll be 50."
5820,"To answer the cognitive thing about Joe. This is a smear that is totally false. Joe may mess up some words here and there. He is a former stutterer. He overcame it and became a career congressman where he passed  165 bills, including the Violence Against Women Act. No one could begin to survive the intense campaign trail if their mind was deteriorating. The right and Bernie supporters have been pushing this narrative since the beginning. There is no truth to it what-so-ever."

5828,The only problem with making the speeches shorter is that one of the criticisms from the Trump and Bernie camps has been that Joe's rallies and addresses were so short because he couldn't handle anything longer.

While early voting began in Minnesota on January 17, the first results from the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries became known with the Iowa caucuses on February 3, 2020.

The actual election of a state's delegates to the national convention can be at a later date. Delegates may either be elected at local or state conventions, from slates submitted by the candidates, selected by the state chairman, at committee meetings or elected directly at the caucuses and primaries. Until the delegates are actually elected, the delegate numbers are by nature projections.

Bernie is going to frame it around WHAT   (what is Joe going to do, Bernie knows he can't win so its all about pinning Joe down)

Joe needs to frame the debate on HOW  (challenge Bernie to explain to the public how the legislative process works, how many votes in each chamber he has for M4A) Bernie has 14 out of 65 in the Senate and  119 out of 218 in the House, no where close.  Tell him he isn't opposed to Bernie's ideas but Bernie doesn't have the votes in the House or the Senate, and its Bernie's job to get the votes. Challenge Bernie to explain how he plans on getting the votes and why he doesn't already, when will he, what is the plan?  Calmly explain how a bill moves through congress to the public.

However, to ignore the economic oppression of the *whole world, especially the global south* via the World Bank and IMF and say I will support a dead end capitalist in the face of collapse because a regime with the same word as Sanders oppressed trans people, is so fucking stupid.

Are you saying that the leading communists and socialists today are harmful towards trans people?

Problem is, capitalism is accelerating civilizational collapse.

5904,"A lot of people did. Kamala, Booker, Gillibrand, Beto, there was a rush of people framing themselves as very left, assuming Bernie's 45% was now a majority, when the actual answer was Clinton was extremely unpopular even within the party. 

The party has still shifted left, as Bidens platform is evidence of, but it's still a party very skeptical of radical policy proposals in a general election. Biden, Pete, and a handful of others figured this out a little early and benefitted."
5905,I‚Äôm not quite sure what your point is. I agree with you that Devin Nunes is wrong and we shouldn‚Äôt be going out to restaurants and what not but public health officials have even said that voting (as long as you‚Äôre healthy) is perfectly fine.

A Kennedy is primarying Ed Market and whoever loses that race would likely run in a special election as would Shannon Lis-Riordan who dropped out earlier this year or maybe even Capuano who lost his seat to Pressley. Plus, Baker has been popular but his popularity is waning due to our crumbling transit system and his cozying up to Pence multiple times this summer so he may be weary of further alienating people.

Section 3. He also voted against the protection of marriage act. And held a really for gays and lesbians while Mayor of Burlington. 

He didn't come out and say he was in favour of gay marriage until the 2000's, I agree. But he sure as hell was working with LGBT people far before diamond Joe.

And okay, the NRA paid for ads supporting him because he believed in gun rights, just as some believe in keeping the workers armed, like most socialists. Kind of on brand. They saw that supporting him helped hold their power so they took out ads against his oponent. Not really rocket science, though yes if I were him I would have denounced the NRA."

5988,"Sorry I know you guys are overall positive and wholesome.

So I wanted to be sure and point out that I didn‚Äôt think that was what y‚Äôall meant.

It *miiiiiiiight* be worth it to phrase it a little more specifically to make them feel more like we are welcoming their questions or even any interest they might have in the campaign.

There was a massive and unprecedented assault against Clinton's campaign by foreign powers which spread enormous amounts of propaganda against her, propped up other leftist candidates to split the progressive vote, and **conspired** with her GOP opponent. Then James Comey steps in a **week** before the election and further rat-fucks her campaign with the email bullshit.

A 30% chance is completely assailable and not really that unlikely. On the other hand, 538 currently predicts Biden has a chance greater than 99.9% of winning the most delegates.

But I still want to see the debate.. for one thing.. Joe needs the practice. Biden has had one ok debate so far this primary.. the last one.. that one helped him way more than hurt in any way.  The rest he did horribly at tho.. If there is a chance to get another good debate under his belt before he has to face Trump I would think his supporters would want that.

There's a lot of shade in some more extreme circles that will thrown it in your face if you're ""straight passing"" because people can't tell you're gay the minute you walk into the room. There's neither wrong with either, in my opinion, it's really a reaction to how/where you grew up and your personality.

Personally, I find him to be the ""rural gay"" that my friends and I all joke that we are. We don't really stick out from a crowd of straight men, like some of my gay friends who were raised in more urban areas, but that doesn't mean we're not there  - I'm a hockey player, in the physics department, who dresses almost exclusively in jeans, flannels, and baseball caps, but that doesn't mean I love my boyfriend any less than my friend who wears leopard-print jackets and does theatre loves his."

6004,Same! OMG...tears in two days. I can't take it anymore!!!
6005,"Because he‚Äôs being honest. Trying to accurately predict the cost the US of a Medicare for all system over a decade is a fools errand. Range of values can be found but putting a singular number on it and expecting it to hold through medical breakthroughs and unexpected changes is a number no one will ever agree on.

His main point is the total cost is irreverent if we are simply trying to use the most efficient system. If you believe every American deserves a right to healthcare, then the question should be how do we do it the most cost efficient way. Every other developed country has shown us that a universal healthcare system is far and away a more efficient way to do it then our current system."

Biden could say he supports every policies of Bernie's and that he is copying them all. It wouldn't matter. Progressives do not trust him. Full stop.

&gt;After President Donald Trump issued scathing comments about Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, saying she's ""not stepping up,"" and ""doesn't know what's going on,"" she told WWJ 950 the state is having trouble getting the equipment they need to fight the novel coronavirus.

&gt;""What I've gotten back is that vendors with whom we've procured contracts -- They're being told not to send stuff to Michigan,"" Whitmer said live on air. ""It's really concerning, I reached out to the White House last night and asked for a phone call with the president, ironically at the time this stuff was going on.""

&gt;The other stuff was Trump speaking with Sean Hannity on FOX News about Whitmer, a Democrat who has said very pointed things about the federal government's lack of coordinated response to the coronavirus crisis. Trump said of Whitmer, ""She is a new governor, and it's not been pleasant ... ""We've had a big problem with the young ‚Äî a woman governor. You know who I'm talking about ‚Äî from Michigan. We don't like to see the complaints."" 

""Honestly kind of disturbing"" is a good way of putting it. When Lincoln said you can fool some of the people all of the time I thought he meant something like 5%, not 50%."

6020,"I‚Äôm pretty sure the rules for posting request no older articles, but I agree, I would have loved for it to have more visibility."
6021,Our best days still lie ahead ‚ù§Ô∏è
6022,"My wife and I just voted for Biden today in Maine and couldn't be happier about it. Bernie was recently projected to win by a comfortable margin here, but at the same time, a couple of days ago this would have been a vote for Pete and a vote for Warren. There's more unity out there now than some of the polls are currently showing, so let's do this thing!"
6023,Only one candidate left campaigning on blow it all up because I‚Äôm going to lose again.
6024,All my black friends dislike Kamala...for what it's worth.
6025,"I am really a fan of Terri Sewell as VP. She is a black woman who has a fairly compelling personal history (a lot of ""firsts""). She's been in Congress for a decade come inauguration day, is from a safe blue seat, too. She wouldn't help with a swing state of course, but maybe would give a slight boost to Doug Jones (yeah I know I'm dreaming) and would help with the critical black vote in general. 2016 taught us the danger of assuming strong black support in the primary would win you the general."
6026,is something you made or found?
6027,"I can‚Äôt get news on Reddit.  Nothing but how amazing Bernie is and how everyone else is awful.  That couldn‚Äôt possibly be the reality of things.   Something shady going on, obviously.  Or maybe he is perfect and everyone else is truly a sell-out and cares only about billionaires.  The news on here is like a Fox News for Bernie."
6028,"So much better than others.  We're just about as set as we can be, living on a few acres in rural nowhere makes it easier, still being only ten minutes from a walmart with pickup in the parking lot helps too.  We're far from rich but financially we're okay.  We're sort of preppers (not the bonkers kind), dad is ex-USAF cold warrior and kind of instilled a bit of that in me.

I'm extremely concerned for others though.  What's an out of work person living paycheck to paycheck in a city apartment supposed to do?  I guess they've halted evictions and foreclosures so that's a good step but there's a lot more than just having a place to live needed to make it.

I don't like anything about this whole mess."
6029,"Hello /u/Dmharper80 harper80. I apologize for any downvoters you may receive. We've had a lot of bad-faith Bernie supporters 'round these parts. Here some answers to your questions:

1) Biden supports a public option, as well as the expansion of both Medicare (by lowering the enrollment age to 55) and Medicaid. Biden also wants to regulate prescription drug prices and to import drugs from abroad.

2) Biden is talking to congressional Democrats and other elected officials. He plans on starting daily televised briefings on the coronavirus on Monday to counter Trump's misinformation and to contrast his style of leadership with Trump's.

3) Biden supports a $15 minimum wage."
6030,Lol
6031,Someone tweeted George back asking if the contribution came from their joint account?  lol
6032,"Wow, promising free stuff isn‚Äôt enough?"
6033,"Fracking should continue and be left up to local municipalities and states to regulate where it should be conducted.

A carbon tax should incrementally be implemented to to move us all away from fossil furs entirely."
6034,YESSSS!!! rotr 4 lyyyfe! &lt;3
6035,Fully agreed!
6036,"They're a scam, or they're legitimate debts acquired at 18 years old that people should be held to for the rest of their lives? I think we need to pick one here..."
6037,Absolute hero. His dedication will be necessary to defeat Trump.
6038,"Bernie bought a lake house in North Hero Vermont 

There are .25% blacks in North Hero - might be the whitest place on the planet 

Why would black people vote for him when his ‚Äúvacation‚Äù is escaping from them"
6039,I feel sorry for him

6050,What other states are they predicting joe to win?
6051,Haha that would be awesome
6052,Greetings and welcome!
6053,"It's technically a caucus because that's just what you call it when the party not the state runs the election. But it is run closer to a primary in that it's secret ballot where you just drop off your vote during the voting hours. So it is essentially a party-run primary. Also known as a ""firehouse caucus"" or ""firehouse primary."""

6055,Trump supporters out out out
6056,Still a quality meme!
6057,So you can donate to the campaign of the Democratic nominee.
6058,Honestly it seems like that could be the play to get a lot of Bernie supporters on board. It seems unlikely he will over her though unfortunately.
6059,Well done sir (or ma'am).
6060,"If those are the GOP polls, then Biden is doing fine. Winning Michigan, Pennsylvania and Arizona is enough to win the whole thing."
6061,"I wonder how involved the Sanders campaign is in this. Obviously they are running with it, I hope that is the extent of it."
6062,"This should be completely televised for everyone, not Trump's vanity meetings."
6063,Agreed.
6064,"Mad Spicy ! 

I remember her being very cool on her last interview with Rachel Maddow. She has the right experience too if she were to have to step up ever"

6067,"The text is gone from Pete‚Äôs site, but it was nice to see the Biden subreddit adopt them as well upon Pete‚Äôs endorsement and had a lot to do with earning my own support: https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeBiden/wiki/rulesoftheroad"

6070,I'd be happy with this one.
6071,"Did you not read any of what I just said?

If you aren‚Äôt going to respond to any of my points there is no reason to me respond to the irrelevant points you responded with."
6072,I didn't realize!  A little googling [corroborates that](https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/alyssa-milano-joe-biden-fundraiser-1203387394/)
6073,"Or it's rigged, or there is a deepfake of Biden that comes out doing something terrible and the list goes on.  Hillary should have won too yet here we are."
6074,Everyone's missing the big question: what did they order?
6075,"Careful with the assumption that South Carolina is some sort of crystal ball. I would argue that this presidential primary is more unusual than most and that it shouldn't be used as a gauge of future primaries. Points 1 and 2 are pretty solid IMO, youth vote is notoriously fickle but it's still important regardless.

I would like to hear from your perspective why younger voters didn't really bother turning up for either Yang or Bernie. I have been very confused how a group of such vocal supporters can be so absent at the polls."
6076,"I've been saying it and I'll keep saying it, Bernie's camp is where the bigots on the left have made their home. Racists, sexists, and homophobes have all come out of the woodwork in support of his ""revolution"". I'm concerned that he's not more concerned about this."
6077,Don‚Äôt worry about r/politics. It‚Äôs somehow even less real life than Twitter.
6078,This made me feel so good it isn't even funny.
6079,"I know! He wouldn't have even been a viable candidate without caucuses, which are extremely undemocratic. Last year, he won most of the caucuses, and when they switched to primaries and got more turnout, he lost.  Everything about him is based on lowering turnout and a split field."
6080,Absolutely this!   Glad someone said it.  This is why Biden has an advantage over Bernie because he wins the normal Republicans that have not been brainwashed by Fox News...  he is already starting to get endorsements from Republicans
6081,"I think the General Elections will continue as it is. Congress cannot reschedule the elections as it will violate Federal Law - ""the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November"" or ""the first Tuesday after November 1""

Thank God we have the House of Representatives. Trump and his Senate cannot simply pass laws to change things to their benefit."
6082,I know you can‚Äôt see it but my eyes are rolling
6083,"If Joe Biden ends up losing to Trump, would you blame him or the Bernie bros?"
6084,"To be clear, even winning the general wouldn‚Äôt ease the division created by ideological purity.

Bernie‚Äôs policies aren‚Äôt going to pass congress, and who do you think Berners are going to blame? It won‚Äôt be the Republicans even though they will have the numbers to block... it will be the moderate Dems still in reddish districts who aren‚Äôt (and shouldn‚Äôt be) willing to throw away their chance at reelection voting for an idealistic bill that isn‚Äôt going to pass anyway. He will go to the mat against his own party of ‚Äúcorporate shills‚Äù for not even being able to support the losing bills before he ever directs any political capital towards the Republicans... he could very realistically wreck the Dem party from the inside with populist bullshit."
6085,"Arizona will vote Biden! If you are in AZ, VOTE"
6086,No Kamala flair üò•
6087,"it was so obviously just a funny little mixup with people moving quickly around him.

Bad faith voters for another candidate were having a truly awful night so seized upon it.

Onwards and upwards."
6088,Waukesha Ozaukee Washington
6089,the front page just doesn't appreciate the total absence of malarkey from this sub
6090,"Fundamentally I see Biden reaching out to me as a Pete supporter with this and it's the kind of inclusive politics I want to reward, even though the details are a little different. Bernie and his people don't want to compromise on anything - it's the way they interact, COMRADE - and it means they'll lose the center and we will have a racist traitor for a president forever and ever (until Ivanka is appointed replacement). Thank you Joe Biden for adopting the policies you like from the rest of the dem field."
6091,Hurry up Washington &amp; North Dakota!
6092,"pleaaaaase, god please all I've ever wanted in life is to see Pete face down Pence on the same stage and stare him dead in the eye as he ends his career, I've been so good this year I deserve this"
6093,"I doubt it, after everything Warren brought up about Bloomberg he‚Äôs pretty alienating to a lot of women and people of color. If he really honors his word and backs the nominee with his operation he‚Äôll be a hero though."
6094,I‚Äôd like gillibrand as VP.
6095,Hopefully everyone else will realize its over even if it takes Bernie awhile to figure out how math works.
6096,Could Pete deliver Indiana? Or is that still a long shot
6097,"M4A won't pass.  Obamacare 2.0 will.  Biden has a comprehensive and aggressive climate plan.

I'm not afraid of Biden taking on Trump at all.  Trump is so scared he got himself impeached trying to stop Joe.  Biden is easily taking down Bernie.  Hell, he beat Sanders in states he didn't even campaign in.

Biden stutters.  Always has.  It's not mental decline.  That's a toxic Bernie Bro smear, and you should be ashamed of yourself for believing it.  [Watch](https://www.facebook.com/wlwt5/videos/529417617713933/) his speech last night.  He praises Bernie and his supporters.

Biden has a record that is 50 years old.  You are picking the low-lights and think they are indicative.  He wrote and Passed the Violence Against Women Act, passed the Brady Bill (which Bernie voted against five times), and spearheaded Obamacare.  The only bill Sanders has proposed and passed named a post office.

You are wrong.  Very wrong.  Read Biden's website.  Get 80% of the things you want, and actually have them pass.  Get kids out of cages.  Have every American insured.  Start the rapid decline in US carbon emissions.  Replace RBG properly.

Bernie is done.  Join the team that's going to beat Trump."
6098,I completely disagree about Kamala helping Biden. Being black and from California I don‚Äôt think does enough to help Biden. Joe is obviously going to take California in the general election and he‚Äôs already doing well with black voters. Also Kamala didn‚Äôt do well in the debates her performance got worse over time
6099,And if 2-3% of his elderly base die? Do you think the ones who survive are going to be keen on him?
6100,"Isn't Corbyn basically just an old school Trot at this point? Yeah, no thanks."

6104,"&gt;Seizing 20% of every big company without compensation is normal in western countries? That‚Äôs one of his actual policies.

Kinda. The government wouldnt be ""seizing them"". The corporation would have to set aside 20% of the company to be controlled by the workers. Kinda like a built in union. While that is more radical than most countries, Germany has a somewhat similar law where workers are elect some members onto the board of directors. 

&gt;And universal healthcare is not single payer.

I didnt say that it was."
6105,Joe&amp;Amy 2020
6106,Wasn't it the left-stream media who said Trump was a racist for preventing people from infected areas from coming to the USA?
6107,Class. Act.
6108,Well they could‚Äôve participated by voting. That‚Äôs free.
6109,"Kind of a dick thing to do. Assuming you posted about it in a mocking or supportive way, I agree you should of been banned."
6110,It‚Äôs the best when they say they that the toxicity is a myth while being toxic.
6111,"By the time you hire the staff to do the means-testing administration, you could have just paid the tuition of the three (3) children of super wealthy parents who are *actually* choosing to go to state college. All of whose wealthy parents, by the way, aren't willing to pay for their college education unless they go to some god-awful Christianist madrassah to major in Homophobia. Universal education is liberation from having to depend on awful, abusive parents."
6112,He said he wants someone of the same ideology and believes in his message and way of doing things..... he wants a moderate. Not a progressive like Warren.
6113,If we win without them it only proves they are irrelevant and no one needs to listen to their temper tantrums. This could backfire on them big.
6114,Why are you surprised? He did the exact same thing in 2016
6115,"Oh shit, for real? I thought Beto, Pete, Kamala, Booker, Amy, Yang, Bloomberg, and Gretchen were all going to be VP as well."
6116,"Maybe. It worries me a little bit but a) we have a good lead already and b) many older voters (at least in Ohio) who are at risk for the virus vote by mail anyway. In short, I think we‚Äôll be okay (knock on wood)."
6117,"Okay, fair response here as a Joe supporter. I think Bernie was being serious when he told CNN  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dealing with a fucking pandemic here‚Äù. He‚Äôs stopped advertising, he‚Äôs stopped campaigning, he‚Äôs been staying in Washington working with the senate leaders on solutions to save the economy and the people getting laid off. I‚Äôve never seen eye to eye with most of Bernie‚Äôs proposals, but I will be the first to admit the guy really does care for Americans and is doing his job right now, at enormous personal risk to himself (because of his age and his heart attack, he‚Äôs at high risk of death if he catches it). 

The media has stopped talking about him, and he‚Äôs essentially all but given up. Hell, he‚Äôs even shuttling donations to his campaign over to COVID-19 relief organizations. It may take a few weeks, but he‚Äôs gonna drop out, he‚Äôs just too busy dealing with the crisis right now."
6118,"It dominates the youth but not all the youth. 
Gen Z here for Biden 2020"
6119,My thought process is that Biden underperforms with Hispanics so a Latino women would make a lot of sense!
6120,"&gt;If Joe Biden loses, the American Left must consider forming a new party.

Welcome to complete electoral irrelevance. The actual hard left (lol @ implying Chomsky is even vaguely center-left) is a tiny minority in American politics and only win when they attach themselves to liberals. See: 100 years of the American socialist and communist parties."
6121,"Pretty much everyone here saw Sanders spend 4 months dragging Clinton's reputation through the mud calling her corrupt etc in 2016 after he'd already lost any shot whatsoever at winning the nomination, then throw his hands up in the general and go ""gee, it's not my fault she lost, she was just so unlikable.""

He's gearing up to do the same damn thing again and nobody wants that. It's extraordinarily selfish and risks throwing another election to Trump, all just to sate Sanders' ego. The party can't unite until he drops out, he needs to get gone."
6122,Let the lady have a vacation! Elect a democrat!
6123,As a Pete supporter that‚Äôs why I came over here. Besides the Pete sub (which I stay subscribed to) this is the second biggest hug kind of place. Just glad to support another candidate that believes in being kind to one another.

6127,"The thing about ""my favorite dropped out"" is that the others are young enough to run again. I guess Elizabeth Warren supporters can't say that with a lot of confidence, but hey, at least that means her senate seat is safe and in the right hands. 

And if your favorite was Bloomberg or Steyer, my condolences."
6128,"Idk this type of attack ad feels like the ones that don't look at the whole picture. We see these kinds against Biden. 

Im just curious to know the reasoning behind why Bernie didn't vote for those bills."
6129,Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear!
6130,I just love how we‚Äôre taking back ‚Äòmalarkey‚Äô after the toxic ones tried to twist it into something bad.  :-)
6131,"If the feds legalize will they still look the other way on what the states have done? We dont have any other ""recreational"" controlled substances. The FDA has marijuana as a schedule I. It clearly has medical use so that is wrong but does the president get to tell the FDA how to schedule drugs?

Biden wants to decriminalize and allow the FDA to do its thing. Bernie seems to want to dictate to the FDA how to schedule drugs.

This is more complicated than Bernie understands. States can be more strict but not less. Legalization will be complex."
6132,"You‚Äôre all over the board, you just said they had a gut feeling and no information

6133,"So, is that video of him threatening a union worker and generally barely being able to string a sentence going to be censored all day?"
6134,"I don't agree with a lot of the concensus of /r/neoliberal such their ambivalence to the concentration of economic wealth, privatisation of natural monopolies, advocacy of open borders without consideration of infrastructure and service provision or their hagiography of Margerat Thatcher.

However, I can post these criticisms in /r/neoliberal (and I have) without harassment or being downvoted into oblivion.

I can't say the same of the Purity-Left on reddit or real life."
6135,"Bernie Bros , how contrite"
6136,And only one of us is posting in r sanders for president calling sanders supporters boomers and trump supporters  üôÑ
6137,What? Biden was pro gay marriage before Obama was.
6138,"""I don't take any responsibility"", ""We have it under tremendous control, it will go away"", ""It's a hoax from the democrats"", ""The number will be close to zero"", ""I  give myself a 10"". There are receipts that will hunt him all the way to november, bailout or not ."
6139,"If she were a little older, I'd be all in for Abby Finkenauer. Being from Iowa, she helps Joe in the midwest, as a young, congressional freshman she can be Joe's equivalent of an AOC-like figure, except much less divisive. Plus, she endorsed Biden back in January, before Iowa.

If she weren't also in a very important position, holding the senate seat of Arizona, I'd also think Sinema would be an excellent pick.

I'd also like Yang, for obvious reasons."
6140,The fact that you're proud to have Bloomberg speaks volumes about how broken y'all's morals and guidance is.
6141,"Joe: I can‚Äôt eat this whole bucket of ice cream

6142,"You can give yourself some Pete to Joe flair on this sub by going over to the Community Options, where you will have several choices (of course)."
6143,"It's a little bit of column A and B and C and D and E.

It's a mess! Some of those agents egg on actual progressives to do bad and some of its directly them and some of it's just natural anger.

Progressives generally run hot.

They start mad, angry and to fight against something. When mixed with natural human hormones and nature, you get a powder keg of angst and anger.

Same is true for a lot of Trump supporters as well. They run hot. They're the type to get into a good old barfight. 

Which leads to history and how wars get started, humanity is playing out before our eyes. 

Anyways, endure what you can. Report what you see and then the off of possible. Do your best not to poke the hornets nest."

Bernie is a populist, and I think we've all had enough of populism in the White House."
6147,"Technocratic wonks don't like vague policies and excessive moralizing. Show me how X actual causes Y.

I think Sanders campaign is poorly run because it is filled with YES persons and they believe their own hype."
6148,"Yeah and your history is a testament to how much you guys actually care about unity and civility

ROTR (for those who want it)

What a joke"
6149,"Populism is based on ""us vs. them"" politics.  Trump is against immigrants.  Bernie is against the successful.

They need scapegoats and enemies to justify their existence.  The toxicity is part of the recipe."

UBI is the most progressive policy there is, lmfao

How is he not a progressive?"

6160,"Extremely close - Hillary won by less than 1% and it was the upset of the night.

Looking at the [results by demographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Missouri_Democratic_primary#Analysis), I think Biden will fare better than she did because I think he'll poll better among union households (Sanders won them 54-45) though his support for international trade agreements could be a challenge, and I think he will have moderates locked down better than she did (Hillary won them 55-44; by comparison Biden got 60% of moderates in Minnesota). That, combined with his support from African-American voters, should help him carry the state.

But take nothing for granted! He should absolutely campaign there and deploy Buttigieg and Klobuchar as well."
6161,"With some of the Tuesday polls being this close, it's more important than ever that we phonebank, textbank, knock on doors if you're in one of the states, etc. Obviously what really matters is the delegate numbers, but the media love a comeback/upset narrative; if Sanders manages to eke out a win in two or three of the states this Tuesday - even the ones he was expected to win like Washington - then it could really change the framing of the race headed into the debate and mid-March primaries.

Let's go into overdrive and bring this thing home!"
6162,"It‚Äôs a moronic post, but I don‚Äôt see any threats or harassment, just the standard conspiratorial nonsense."
6163,"Pete didn't do attack ads. Biden started it, seemed to back off as soon as he saw Pete defend him in the debate. There are interesting YouTube videos that show Biden's face as Buttigieg is talking. His eyes drop, he looks sad, maybe ashamed,  while listening to Pete's defense, knowing that he was going to launch attack ads the next day. 

The black Police Chief is an interesting story, can't be understood through sound bites. It was a no-win situation, of a police chief unlawfully recording phone conversations, and the subject of an FBI investigation. That shouldn't have been brought up either. 

But it seemed that this ad disappeared immediately. Was there a redeeming ethic in Biden? Have you guys discussed this at all?"
6164,"I started with Warren and then she mis-pivoted. Then switched to Pete because I like his podcasting and saw he was over performing. Now I am going to Joe. I said he was the most likely to win over a year ago and it turns out I was right. This race has been messy and complicated and crazy.

Cubs should not have won the World Series."
6165,Nevada‚Äôs becoming more and more blue I wouldn‚Äôt be too worried
6166,"I think this discussion goes back to the same argument in 2016.  Bernie supporters (myself included) are not Democrats by any means.  We are members of a whole different party who believed the Democratic party could change.  Many of us are very much turned off by how the DNC has handled the last 2 primaries and realized, the  DNC won't change. 

These individuals are frustrated with a no change 2 party system that does not represent the issues people are talking about: taking on billionaires.  How can you take on billionaires who are not paying their fair share of taxes if you accept donations from them? 

So perhaps the DNC is very confident that this very large these group of voters will ""fall in line"" because we should be afraid of the alternative.  On the contrary, even if Bernie says ""vote for Joe"" we might just sit out this election, vote Green, or maybe vote for Joe?

Last election I begrudgingly voted for Clinton even though she pretty much stole the nomination from Bernie.  I don't think I will be make the same choice again.  The DNC has to earn my vote, not guilt me into it."
6167,I'm from VA.  It looks like our states really pulled through for Joe!
6168,I'd appreciate one of those as well.
6169,"He's not down by much, but between the states that are left and the proportional delegates, he needs to win blowouts in any state where he has a reasonable shot at winning.  Aside from Nevada, when the moderate lane was still pretty crowded, he hasn't really been able to do that.  One of the big states left is Florida with 219 delegates and in the last poll Bernie wasn't even viable."
6170,"His [LGBT policy](https://joebiden.com/lgbtq/) is newer so it might not have hit your radar yet, but there's some parts of it that are absolutely fantastic, like a commitment to actually step in and get involved in international human rights violations, like what Chechnya is doing to gay people, and, essentially, descend upon them with the wrath of a thousand suns to force them to stop using international pressure tactics like sanctions, instead of just writing them a strongly worded letter. He also plans to rush-deliver reviews of veterans who were discharged under DADT and blocked from accessing benefits etc, reevaluate and overturn laws that exist to criminalize or stigmatize HIV status (for example, a number of laws would punish an HIV-pos person for ""exposing"" law enforcement to HIV because they got hurt during an arrest, etc; he'll also push to overturn policies about blood donation by gay men), he's in favor of having an ""X"" gender option on government documents and in general making it easier to switch between M/F/X, and he plans to appoint a Special Envoy in charge of human rights for LGBT people at an international level AND an expert specifically focused on LGBT rights to the National Security Council. There's more to the plan than that (LGBT homelessness, LGBT suicide rates, Trans bathroom laws, etc) but if you can't tell, I'm kind of super hype over having actual recognition of LGBT issues in foreign affairs, instead of just acting like our responsibility towards gay people ends at our country's borders.

Beyond that....his [workers rights plan](https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/) obviously calls for a 15/hr minimum wage but is also HEAVY on the pro-union policies, including making a cabinet-level team to actively promote union membership, and a ""gig economy"" policy that is for all intents and purposes a direct evolution of Pete Buttigieg's plan, who for a while was basically the only one in the race who cared about Uber drivers etc. 

**anyway, tl;dr, definitely read through his** [**plans on the issues**](https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/)**, a lot of people assume they know how he feels about issues but so many of his plans are way more left than he gets credit for.**"
6171,"I voted for Joe this morning for the same reason. I read Pete‚Äôs book and have been following him closely, I also was a big fan of Yang and signed up for a fundraiser before he dropped out. When the Coronavirus started spreading in the US, I realized how badly I want someone in charge who has experience in the arena. After SC, the choice is now clear. Let‚Äôs go Joe!"
6172,"warren shakes out 2% more of the undecided?

6173,"It's because of the EC/Popular Vote discrepancy. If that was betting on who would win the popular vote then it would be clear for Biden, but with the EC depending basically on just 4 or 5 states, it really is a tossup atm"
6174,"It‚Äôs not impossible but I don‚Äôt think so for multiple reasons:
1. Mike is a leader and not really a good team member. That‚Äôs okay because we also need leaders but there can only be one president and I fear that he would undercut Biden‚Äôs authority.
2. He‚Äôs bringing nothing to the electoral map. Yes he would do well with moderate republicans but the most important thing is turnout and having significant support in swing states (both is not the case. On the other hand he could be what Lieberman was to McCain
3. He‚Äôs really unpopular with the left and we need their turnout this will hurt us more than it will help with republicans.
4. He doesn‚Äôt have the connections into the senate over which he is presiding. Therefore he can‚Äôt help too much to get legislation done."
6175,"Moderates aren't voting for Warren, they're voting for Biden. But putting Warren on the ticket likely pulls a few more progressives into the coalition.  They'll feel like now they have a voice in the room."
6176,"Thank you for fighting for kindness, Joe!"
6177,"It‚Äôs a socialist podcast. They are not the best of people. I‚Äôve listened to a few minutes and to be honest I thought they were outright vile to Warren, but that‚Äôs not to say they were nice to others."
6178,Exactly
6179,"Bernie has not had much success in Democratic Presidential primaries. But while Joe was busy suffering those tough losses, Bernie has consistently advocated the same progressive agenda the entire time. While you were suffering those tough losses, Bernie was still on the floor in the Senate arguing for the changes my generation so desperately wanted, and I wasn't even born yet.

There's a lot more to go off here but this is my favorite part about all this - I literally don't know what you like about Joe as a person/politician, or have any understanding as to why you think he would be a good president, other than you guys having ""shared"" tough losses.

Bro, learn to cut the losses and let's put whose best fit to lead this country in office."
6180,"Assuming the other states still vote tomorrow, it‚Äôs still going to be a commanding victory for Biden. 

At that point, I think it would be time for Obama to put his finger on the scale and try to get this to end as soon as possible. There is absolutely no need to drag this out."
6181,Even if there was M4A there would need to be new emergency funding since it would still overwhelm the system.
6182,"A friend emailed me to ask if it is true like her Trump friend says, that Biden has dementia.  Anyone got a concise source/link to refute this that I can send her?  It sounds like this is being pushed by both Trump and Sanders people."
6183,"Wow. I've donated to Joe. Love Joe! Had to search for this and wondering why it wasn't on his front page. Now I see why. That was a weak speech. Great message, TERRIBLE presentation. Its got to be better, stronger. Come on Joe! We want you!"

No more debates, no more interaction with Bernie - just assume the presumptive nominee position and talk to voters nationally. Do town halls in intimate settings, get out your surrogates to rallies.

Wipe Bernie off your shoe, the only thing indulging him after Michigan does is drag this out longer. It‚Äôs time to unite, most of us did this last Sunday."
6191,Agreed but what drives tuition up probably more than paying for academics is administrative fees. Hopefully any tuition-free college bill addresses that issue.
6192,"And when asked about it Bernie said something to the effect of ""his politics are not my politics"".

And this right here is why he's losing and why he can't lead this party."
6193,Thank you!!
6194,that's kinda odd bc the CLP/DfD schism was partly a result of the CLP mods stanning Biden too hard and bullying Kamala and Warren supporters
6195,I‚Äôm quite sure he appeals to everyone who wants a Trump-free White House.
6196,"The idea of a VP pick providing a geographic boost is super overrated. That hasn't been a serious factor in decades. Like, Virginia went big for Hillary, but that was because suburban voters (especially in NOVA) couldn't stand Trump, not because of people's love of Tim Kaine.

Gillibrand's pretty unlikely I think, but if she was from a swing state it would be a similar dynamic."
6197,"I always thought of him as Jefferson Smith form Mr. Smith Goes To Washington. A man who shouldn't have really been appointed to the Senate, but proved everyone wrong."
6198,Kind of disagree. Bernie is in it for the long haul and will do everything he can to smear Biden. We need to fight back their narratives if we want to have a relatively unified party going into the general.

If you have any issues you have a particular care for, we can start from there.  But Biden has a tooon if awesome stuff once you really dig in.  He has the receipts for getting stuff done in spaces Bernie only has words for (healthcare, lgbt, immigration, environment, etc) and his policy platform has some great policies for climate, healthcare, housing, and more.  Biden is actually quite progressive, but simply considers feasibility and down ballot impact compared to Bernie.  I‚Äôd argue he‚Äôs really actually quite left, compared to a true centrist like Bloomberg, but he has a familiarity that makes him appeal to moderates, hence why Bloomberg voters 2nd choice is Biden.

Also I can say the guy has empathy without doubt.  He‚Äôs a genuinely good person that‚Äôs not the best at self promotion.  I can say at the start I was kind of meh vote blue but I‚Äôm genuinely excited for Biden now.

There‚Äôs also the fact that Bernie has some problematic policies. For me, I‚Äôd top it out on nuclear ban and Federal Jobs Guarantee, but there‚Äôs more."

6214,"You‚Äôve received great responses. My 2 cents is that I see Biden being driven more by his values than by ideology. His inconsistency is a virtue in that he appears to value his role as a representative for the people and relies in the best available data. That may lead to wrong conclusions, like in Iraq, but I‚Äôm way more comfortable with that approach than a belief system that is almost like a religion"

And Bernie had better give some serious consideration to dropping out, and soon.

6223,Did you not read my post?
6224,"&gt; Bernie has denounced anyone who uses hate or vicious attacks against any candidate including Warren and Biden.

Bernie Sanders had implemented a campaign sponsored conspiracy theory about Joe's mental health. That's not promoting a progressive agenda, that's mud slinging."
6225,"Bernie is stubborn and in 2016, it bordered on childish. But, he‚Äôs also a very smart man with a bold vision. I‚Äôd like to think that he sees the writing on the wall and realizes that Joe is the best way for the policies he has made so mainstream to be enacted."
6226," 

To me some of Bernie's policies make a lot of sense, I believe all citizens should have medical insurance, but I believe most Americans just want people covered not necessarily government run insurance.

My issue with Bernie is that in order for him to get anything passed in Congress he will need to keep the house and win the senate, a lot of dems who won in 2018 were in vulnerable rep districts. Having Bernie a ""socialist"" lead the party would drive rep turnout and probably lose those seats. Then Mitch would just block everything Bernie proposes like he did with Obama. Bernie has no track record of getting anything passed in congress.

2020 we have the senate races, a census year (hello gerrymandering), and a supreme court justice likely ( 3 liberals, 5 conservatives, 1 moderate... we could be down to 2-1-6 ) if dems lose out in 2020 it will set them back years.

Bernie has already fore-fitted Florida to the republicans"

6231,"I gotta say, if this is his best response to the problems brought up in the ads he's in trouble. Trump is going to be hitting him on his record the same way he did Clinton, he needs to decide how to respond and dodging the question by saying that even bringing up Biden's record is helping Trump is a weak response. Biden's record is the biggest reason I don't support him and this type of response makes me even less inclined to change my mind"
6232,"I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Pete supporter and am *heartbroken* that he's ending the bid.  Especially when other people carry on with much less support than him in a similar lane (especially looking at you, Klob).

Sometimes I wish Joe was younger.  I do worry about the health of any late septuagenarian.  But I think Joe has the wisdom and humility to choose an excellent team to be on his staff, for his VP and his Cabinet.  And I think he is vastly more electable than Sanders.

Sometimes things aren't perfect in politics, but I think Joe is the best option of the viable candidates."
6233,"If you are on Bernies campaign, you‚Äôre at least waiting until March 17 after the debate."
6234,"Even with progressive policies you still have to conduct marketing. A lot of voters still don't read deep into policies. So yes, he does have to create videos and talk to people in that group to see if they will listen. His goal is to unite against Trump, so he can try without compromising his stance. People are slapping down this idea without even giving it a chance. Much like what the left did to Elizabeth Warren when she wanted to work with moderates. You have to give people a chance and see what they're going to do."

6256,"&gt; 1) Biden does not support national healthcare or even affordable healthcare

The number of uninsured under ACA dropped in half, Biden was a part of that. That's 10s of millions of people, and Biden wants to expand it. Get off the pro Bernie subs.

&gt; Biden has received incredible amounts of money from the mega rich

Biden didn't have have ads in several states last night and almost zero field offices in California. He doesn't have ""incredible amounts"" of money, he has no amounts.

6259,"For profit colleges target low income kids and children of single parents, people are absolutely drowning in debt from these schools (my husband being one of them) and often have to work low paying or under the table jobs to keep any money for their bills. On the other side of this, those people will be even further in debt with their private lenders on top of other bills that are piling up. The idea that people with high student debt went to good schools is absolutely incorrect. Cutting down on their total federal debt will lower their monthly payment when this is over, without any consequences for the borrower. This would be a huge relief to our family and I know many others. We did not go to big expensive schools."

I prefer her in the Senate because I think she will have more power there than as VP."

6265,If Joe Biden literally dies in the next few months. That‚Äôs the only way.
6266,"At this point, looking at the record voter turnout for the primaries that Joe Biden is sweeping, coupled with anti-Trump sentiment that seems to be encouraging voters to get out more (I live in VA, Dems won big in part thanks to anti-Trump voters who just voted blue), I think he has a good chance.

I voted Sanders in the primary but I‚Äôll admit I did almost go to Biden (Pete dropped out and Warren wasn‚Äôt viable so I had to do some last minute deciding) and both honestly suck in their own way."
6267,I wish CNN would stream his segments somewhere.

6276,"I think Tuesday‚Äôs results in Michigan vs 2016 showed that rather than yearning for an ultra progressive policy platform, white blue collar workers simply did not like Hillary Clinton. A good chunk of Sanders‚Äô 2016 support left him in favor of Biden, so there‚Äôs reason to believe that this vote was more anti-Hillary than pro-Sanders. My politics are closer to Bernie than Joe to be sure, but the argument I keep hearing that if we make a sharp turn to the left, we‚Äôll win, doesn‚Äôt have much evidence to support it. Joe is winning in the states and with the demographics we need to flip several states and get back the blue wall. If Bernie cannot win these people against Biden (who many on the left view as weak), I don‚Äôt understand the argument that he‚Äôs all of a sudden going to trounce Trump."
6277,That‚Äôs hilarious. Just stick your head in the sand and bitch even more about the establishment.
6278,GOOD.

I mean cant the president just say ""put it to a vote and let the people decide?""

It happens all the time in europe.
Ive got a feeling americas more complicated tho."

6283,"You where referring to Biden as ""our candidate"" months ago. 

???"
6284,Lol yeah very true
6285,"Out and about right now, but will send links when I can. It has not been equal or privliged treatment for Bernie Sanders from the DNC.
And no, Sanders is not my top pick. He's my third."
6286,Do you guys think the bussing thing during the first debate will be a problem down the line ? Can it be used by republicans to sow discord in the ticket ?
6287,"Mayor Pete will become Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. That‚Äôs a role that will allow him to move to DC, get experience, and prepare for a run in 2024. He doesnt have the experience for Secretary of State."
6288,"It was pretty clear that Bernie had hit his ceiling, which was pretty low, then picked up some soft support when Biden started falling.  But Democrats have unified behind Biden and Bernie now has no chance."
6289,The cult of Bernie are attempting to spin the vast amount of technical difficulties with the Zoom / Facebook live stream as incompetence and taking clips out of context to make Joe seem older. They will stop at nothing to elect Donald Trump in the pursuit of their candidate now finishing a distant second.
6290,"A preeminent Constitutional scholar who by his own admissions is prone to crazy assertions about Trump? Yeah, I think he might make a mistake on this."
6291,"I‚Äôd like to direct you to the r/BernieSanders response to this crisis as well as every other world leader. 

Sad to say, it‚Äôs not that things are being handled poorly everywhere, it‚Äôs that things are being handled poorly here in the US (although we aren‚Äôt the only ones).

There are many things we could learn by watching other world leaders actions right now and hopefully use that info to help improve our own response."
6292,I agree too.   3 weeks ago I would have never supported this but due to the math I do.  GOP governors are using this to drag out the primary for us.
6293,"career bureaucrat.  hopefully a future AG.  not a good VP.  we need someone competent to be VP.  If the most competent person is a woman, so be it.  If it's a man, then that's fine also.  The fastest way to love the middle is to start going down the road of identity politics."
6294,High turnout requires big tents
6295,before the primary was pretty much over and this did anything but damage the nominee. being transparently loyal to a hostile foreign power bent on reelecting the president didn't help her either.
6296,and even more thrilled if he chose her as VP. She would destroy Pence in debates.
6297,They should make it less obvious at least
6298,"We had gay marriage during the Obama administration because Biden fought for it, AGAINST Obama. We got the ACA in the first place because Biden helped fight for it. And I'll remind you, it might be a broken ass piece of shit, but at the time the ACA was the most daring piece of progressive legislation ever passed and was never supposed to be achievable."
6299,Welcome.
6300,Did you read the post?
6301,"Or localized ‚Äî his response to Hurricane Maria was an absolute, horrifying disaster, but most people never saw how bad it was."
6302,"Your sense of pragmatism seems unfounded. Bernie himself knows that things can't change overnight, but he does know that if you don't push for things, you'll never get anywhere. If you're concerned about the Supreme Court, you should know that Biden helped confirm one of those conservative justices, all while ignoring a women trying to let everyone know Clarence Thomas sexually harassed her. 

Joe Biden is your average person with average flaws, swayed by whatever the current narrative is. He's well meaning, but he isn't forward thinking. I think who we elect as president should be held to a higher standard."
6303,Welcome!
6304,"Campaigns are remarkably flexible and opportunistic at this point.  No doubt, he'll be in Michigan though."
6305,"Wrong.

The only way to get real change in this country is deny its corporate power base power until it gets it right. The Republicans learned this painful lesson, the Dems refuse to learn from the Clinton fiasco."

6308,"OH NO NO NO NO 

HA HA HA HA HA HA"
6309,I will say this. I have nothing but love for any Tulsi supporters who come here to support Joe. I welcome them with open arms. And I look forward to working with them to help get Joe nominated and to beat Trump.
6310,"Well, it is true that you are free to be an asshole. I was just giving you a chance to show you have decency. I can see you are going to decline the invitation."
6311,Can you do nd a reddit sub anything like that one for Biden or Warren or Pete or Amy or any other Democratic candidate?
6312,"So effectively, it becomes something like Next Gen?"
6313,"I think there is hope, I have a number of conservative friends who could vote for Biden, but not Sanders. Then there is my dad, he was a Trump donor and now is an outspoken critic."
6314,"And whack job, super mature Rashida ‚ÄúBoo Hillary‚Äù Tlaib just slandered him. I know Michigan is much smarter than that."
6315,I think Sanders tanked his numbers by the constant rhetoric of the establishment. He is basically dismissing  voters across the country. His establishment talk is no different than Trump‚Äôs Deep State scam.
6316,"1. I‚Äôd recommend re-reading my comment. I never said we‚Äôd get those things under a Biden presidency. But the justices Biden would appoint would be significantly less likely to block those things if President Ocasio-Cortez gets them passed in 2030. They have a 0% chance of survival under a 7-2 conservative majority. 

2. Yes, a conservative-majority Supreme Court has already begun to gut the Voting Rights Act, and it‚Äôs in the middle of hearing a major abortion case, which could have huge implications for women‚Äôs rights in this country. This shit isn‚Äôt hypothetical. 

3. The rights of undocumented immigrants are still worth fighting for, and voting for."
6317,"No. An ideologically split ticket is a bad idea, especially with a president as old as Biden who's unofficially floated only serving one term.

Progressives won't win this election. Klob or someone like her is the best bet for going after the voters who gave the House back to the Democrats.

The crazy minority of Bernie Bros who might vote third party or Trump if they don't get their way won't be won over by Warren or some other progressive on the ticket.

But a progressive firebrand on the ticket could scare away the purple state independents who created the blue wave of '18."

6322,"I've kind of changed my mind about Bernie staying in the race until after Tuesday's primary due to the Coronavirus.   

Initially I thought he should bow out gracefully after this Tuesday if things go as expected.  However, now I think he should drop before Tuesday.  Fine, let him do the debate to promote his issues but on Monday I think he should drop.   My reasons below:

The turnout at the polls may be low, I do not think we should be encouraging high voter turnout due to the virus.  Therefore , if Bernie drops , Joe is the nominee and lets just move forward and go after Trump and let the primary turnouts be small.

If there was no coronavirus or if Bernie had more than a 15% chance at this point I might feel differently , but 538 has Joe at &gt;99% of winning the nomination.

I respect Bernie supporters and I know this is not something most want to hear but its time to admit defeat and come together."
6323,"I love this, especially the fact that Bernie and Bill and Hillary are included. We will stand united."
6324,Agree with Joe Biden here. There is no point in taking the focus and media attention away from the fight against the Covid-19 virus.
6325,"It's [looking like Bernie will take this to convention](https://mobile.twitter.com/VABVOX/status/1238449687302201345). I really wish he wouldn't. It's going to weaken the nominee for Trump, waste everyone's money, and then when you add in the virus it looks really bad. I gave him the benefit of the doubt for the debate and Tuesdays vote but staying in till at least the end of April is too much."
6326,"Yeah for sure, Joe actually wasn‚Äôt my first choice either, but my preferred candidate dropped out a while ago. I had to grieve for a bit but I eventually got back up and joined this sub. Take however long you need!"
6327,Just keep that attitude in the general.
6328,"You have to give them credit for one thing, though

this did appear in the Sanders sub for a while"
6329,"I cant tell you how many people in know, here in Northeast PA, who voted for Trump in 2016 just because Biden wasn't in the race. Hes going to win PA"
6330,And guess what?  Elizabeth Warren didn't have to run a campaign to the convention to get this to happen.  If you work with people you can convince them of your ideas.

If anyone else is reading this: this is why I don't debate the topic of GMOs on Reddit. It's almost always pointless... the chance that you get through to a person is so low, it isn't worth the time spent making your case. From my observations and experiences, it's highly unlikely that that you 

1. Think GMOs are scary
2. Fire up your computer and open Reddit
3. Change your opinion based on the words of a random internet person

That's why we really shouldn't elect folks (e.g. Bernie) who use their voice and authority to create more people with these opinions.

Edit: Please Biden voters, can you help convince me why he‚Äôs a good candidate? Not a Bernie or Trump supporter. I was hoping Tulsi Gabbard would have a better run.

Another edit: If you‚Äôre going to downvote, can you at least help me understand why people are voting for him and/or why I should? Thanks"
6335,Not a good sign for Sanders. He spent a lot of time there. This is huge.
6336,Damn. I didn‚Äôt know that.
6337,"I said, it is unlikely that a republican would get in again. I never said ""he won't let another republican get elected again."" Read it again."
6338,Ah I forget Joe was in the locker room during that video.
6339,We have about as much of a chance seeing Joe Biden get any progressive work done as we would if we brought George Bush from 2001 in a time machine and made him president again.
6340,"Yep, they‚Äôre union workers. My hope is that it allayed his fears of gun grabbing."
6341,Not sure what to think of this poll. The last two polls had Biden up by +4 and +5.
6342,"stop

just stop brigading I‚Äôm a bernie guy myself but you make us look like jackasses"
6343,"Joe Biden wants to eliminate fossil fuel usage.  He will stop fracking on federal land, but doesn‚Äôt think stopping it on private or state land is feasible.  Rather, he wants to pass a carbon tax to penalize people who use dirty natural gas or coal, and speed the transition away from those damaging fuel sources."
6344,Do you watch full speeches or just montages?
6345,Bernie here tryna win michigan. Bidens moved on and is trying to sweep the day
6346,"I think Pete VP might still be his best option. He needs to expand his demographics, and counter his biggest weakness (his age)"
6347,I think it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs not a whole lot going on right now given the virus and various primaries being postponed.
6348,Buddy you and I learned very different things from Sander‚Äôs 2016 campaign
6349,In January? Didn‚Äôt Coronavirus emerge in China in February?

6358,"To the Sanders supporters who will come in here later to troll or maybe even offer congratulations:

It's time to unite. Your candidate had some good ideas but wasn't popular enough to be nominated.  There's no mathematical path for him to win the nomination, his only hope is the pandemic shuts down our country for months and he can try to contest the convention. That's not a win, that's a recipe for disaster and an instant win for Trump.

It's time to bow out gracefully. You know that in your heart. You may not like Biden but you can't argue he's not a good person with empathy and compassion. 

Tell Bernie to hang it up because it doesn't look like he's going to do it on his own."
6359,"They think Biden will lose like Hillary and Kerry, because they think he's a conservative/moderate."
6360,"I'm mostly active on the EW subreddit, but I wanted to crosspost this over here because we're trying to build bridges with y'all :)"
6361,Welcome to the party :)
6362,Welcome!!
6363,"That's why I'm glad Bernie didn't drop out. We get to have a real debate, even if it's a town hall format, in which that won't be a problem anymore."
6364,Dear god if she‚Äôs the VP
6365,"I find this a little ironic because come the general election, everyone is going to want to rally together to vote for Blue no matter who it is. The whole democratic primary puts such a big divide between it cannot fail but to alienate a large number of them."
6366,"I don‚Äôt pick candidates based on their supporters, but I am going to criticize those supporters when they do things like that. It is not just limited to Reddit either. At my state‚Äôs caucus, the Sanders supporters have a reputation for being the rudest and most annoying. I knew people who needed headphones to drown out the things the Sanders supporters were shouting at them."
6367,"IMO, it‚Äôs a good thing. It gives Joe an opportunity to directly speak to Sanders supporters and win them over on his terms, no sound bites, no media interpretations."
6368,"Pete achieved a lot in this campaign. He was the first gay candidate to win a state in a presidential race. He made history and will inspire other LGBT candidates for years. By stopping Bernie from running away with wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, he weakened him enough for Joe to catch up in SC. Now thanks to his noble decision to leave the race when it was clear he didn't have a path left, we have a chance to stop Sanders and beat Trump in November."
6369,This has been one of the best days of the cycle. I look forward to the results tomorrow!
6370,"But really, legalization is a question for Congress not the President. The President could issue an annual pardon, but cannot directly legalize the drug. As for states with legalization bills, all that really means is they won‚Äôt use state resources to prosecute as SCOTUS made it abundantly clear that drugs are solely within the purview of the Federal government under the dormant commerce clause. 

So all Biden is saying is that the law enforcement arms of his administration (DEA, ATF, CBP, ICE, FBI, etc) will deprioritize marijuana offenses‚Äîbasically the same approach President Obama took to DREAMers, which is to say all an executive can do without Congress fixing a bad law. 

If this is a top issue for you then look to the Senate, not the Presidency (as long as one presidential candidate isn‚Äôt threatening to veto any legalization package)."
6371,"We might break 4000 today!!! That would be nice. A small but ardent group of supporters, ready to help Joe."
6372,"Note: he's taken much of the *young* Latino vote, which skews hard to the left.

In Florida and Arizona where the Latino and Hispanic population is much more moderate and conservative Biden excels"
6373,Biden is a sexual predator. I guess you want another sexual predator for President.
6374,"Should? Kamala Harris.

Would? Kamala Harris.

Will be? Kamala Harris."
6375,"He could but he really shouldn't. That's peak Trumpism. No matter how qualified she is, it's a bad look."
6376,Lol your boy‚Äôs still gonna loose tomorrow
6377,"How come when I view videos of Biden during 2008 and 2012 he is able to speak eloquently while now he flubs memorized speech lines. Just view his performance against Palin, it's a completely different Biden."
6378,Should now!
6379,Good call!
6380,Hervis Rogers for VP.
6381,Lots of campaigning and fundraising. I'm considering running for a local office with our party. But for this election I am definitely voting Biden. This is not a year to protest vote.
6382,"Yeah. I think it provides a good opportunity for other people to get their voice and positions heard since they are part of him winning. That goes for Liz supporters as well, their voice is definitely valued here."
6383,The difference was that in 2016 he had fewer delegates than Hillary.
6384,What happened on Super Tuesday?
6385,About damn time.
6386,"The thing is my parents are Trump supporters and while I may not like him, there are pros that I can see happening.

I really hate his foreign policies first of all, but at least he is not screwing up the economy as Bush did which screwed my parents over.

The pros I take from his presidency is that he changed politics whether we like it or not. He exposed MSM. Also he's not doing as much damage as he could if it were someone else like Mike Pence.

By having Trump change politics, it's a good wake up call for the DNC in that we no longer want politics to be controlled by corporate funding.

I do hope we eventually get Ranked Choice Voting and also Democracy Dollars for a more fair democracy. I want more support for local journalism as well as MSM has been interfering / manipulating our democracy for ages.

Sometimes, the negatives happen so we can appreciate the good. The way I see it though, Bernie is just going to inspire this civil war of back and forth which doesn't go anywhere nor solve our problems today."
6387,And guarantee Trump wins by splitting the Democrats? Is he really that stupid?
6388,"That's right! And if we can retake the Senate, we can actually do a LOT more than just go back to normal. $15 min wage, healthcare access for everyone, tuition free college for most, gun control, climate change, etc."
6389,"I tend to look at Emerson with a weary eye, given their Bernie favored polling"
6390,"AFAIK Bloomberg is giving his apparatus to Joe, given the endorsement"

6399,"they have been that way because it is the nature of far left populism. 

They will bully, harass, doxx. and even joining together with trump just to beat democratic ""establishment""."
6400,"&gt; Well a lot of Bernie supporters, myself included, feel there is no way to honestly and morally become a billionaire.

Yeah I just fundamentally disagree with that. Point to specific billionaires and tell me why they have done immoral things, sure. That's true of many of them, but honestly I think writing off everyone as immoral is simply bigoted.

Steyer for example is billionaire who I really believe is an upright, moral person, who's using his money and power to advance social justice and progression as much as he can."
6401,Yeah. I won't like it but it's not about me; it's about the country's future.

6404,"Amy went there 6 times prior.  

We need her to deliver MI, WI , MN and IA."
6405,So what happens now?
6406,&gt;Wisconsin and Kansas both exemplify something PPP has found repeatedly in its general election polling- almost all of the undecideds are Democratic leaning voters who hate Trump but either support Biden and are reluctant to vote for Sanders in the general or support Sanders and are reluctant to vote for Biden in the general.
6407,"I think your missing the point I‚Äôm making. I‚Äôm fully aware that racism is alive and real.

6409,So this tweet is just about a suburban portion of Cook?
6410,Yes.
6411,"The linked twitter thread, if accurate, casts serious doubts on this woman's credibility. I'd first go the ""innocent until proven guilty"" route, which I think applies as much in everyday social life as in a court of law."
6412,OH shit you had me good lol.
6413,"Honestly? Maybe at local/state levels this line of thinking is okay. It's super sad this isn't the case, but damn near everything is tied to party line voting, so really you are somewhat forced to decide which party is in your best interest, and vote along with that party. Yay democracy...

Also for the tail end of your comment, care to elaborate? I do not mean this sarcastically or with intend any malice, I'd simply like to know why you support Trump, since I have a hard time wrapping my head around it."
6414,It's notorious for not having any admin. God... I hope it's not real.
6415,"Came here to post just this. As an unaffiliated moderate scared to shit of both Trump or Sanders I am very happy to see the sane democrats consolidating behind Biden and hopefully just in time.

Thank. God."
6416,"That's fair. I actually think my ideal politician is one that reflects the popular opinion of the time, not just during elections. I don't think Joe has an awful political history, as much as I think the last fourty years of American politics has been problematic."
6417,Credit to u/TheBellmanHimself
6418,"First of all, Baker knows his career is over if he appoints a Republican. He'll almost certainly appoint an independent or a Blue-Dog Democrat. And second, the replacement would be in office for only 100 days before the special election is held, which the Democrat will win."
6419,But the internet told me Biden doesn't stand a chance...
6420,"I really don‚Äôt know a lot about her. I‚Äôve just started reading about her in the past few days. If you‚Äôre saying she doesn‚Äôt excite you or your family, then it‚Äôs probably not crazy to assume you‚Äôre speaking for other Latinos."
6421,"If you go to a sub like ourpresident where they worship Bernie you realize really quick that the posts get 10-30k likes and that those come from everywhere, we have 300 MILLiION people, who knew these small Reddit echo chambers wasn‚Äôt indicative of real life?"
6422,He should pick Hillary only if he wants to lose the election in November. Maybe someone less controversial?

6424,"Not only is Biden doing well in Texas... he's doing well in the battleground counties that you need to flip the state.

Seems to me, if you vote for a democratic SOCIALIST don't be surprised when he starts to implement SOCIALIST ideas. Like [guaranteed work for all](https://berniesanders.com/issues/jobs-for-all/). That's like a staple of socialism and definitely a radical idea, even though he says otherwise.

6436,"Yang supporter here, I thought about supporting Bernie in the election after yang dropped out but I  really don‚Äôt see the funding working out for Bernie‚Äôs plans. And I like how both Biden and yang want to unite the nation, both republicans and democrats, instead of a revolution with attacking anyone who doesn‚Äôt agree. Bernie‚Äôs supporters condemning all republicans leaves a sour taste in my mouth as well and will harm unity in the country. So here‚Äôs hoping biden will sweep Super Tuesday tomorrow!"

6439,"Do they have the data specifically for the 4-year public schools?

Because, once you lump in private 2-year schools into the calculation, it dramatically changes the math.

The difference of opinion between Pete/Joe and Liz is on making 4-year institutions (universally) free.

They already agree on wiping out the loans for predatory schools."

6441,"We can absolutely hang our hat on seniors voting. They're the ones most likely to hit the polls frankly.  But you absolutely, 1,000% need the youth to vote. A big reason why there are more Democrats than registered Republicans is ""the youth"", basically 18-39 range.  The issue is, it's cute we have more voters but it means nothing if they don't actually vote.

Obama won because the youth came out for him in massive numbers. My rural po dunk college town had lines until 10:30 PM at polling stations that closed at 8:00.  It's why you saw him win Pennsylvania by 11 points.  


If the youth don't vote, we lose in November. It's really that simple."

While I can not speak for all Bernie Supporters out there, I can say I truly believe we are all hoping for the same general things, we just have different ideas in how to get there. But the voters have spoken, and Joe is our guy.

6456,"Welcome! I'm a Pete supporter who onboarded to Biden. Pete dropped out the night before I was going to absentee vote (I'm an expat) and so Biden was the obvious choice for me and I submitted my ballot that morning.... but then that afternoon when Pete, Klobuchar and Beto all threw themselves behind Joe it was a real ""omfg"" moment for me. I got swept into it and sucked into this crazy coalition of dems - honestly the current state of Team Joe is what I've been daydreaming about since the beginning of the election. We've all been through hell with our individual candidates and come out the other side with more respect for them and each other, and we're coalescing around one candidate. That's what we need to beat Trump. Just my slightly tipsy 2 cents. Welcome again!"

6485,"Stupidly,I respect him so mud muchfor practicing what he preached."
6486,"So the thing is ... Biden had no cash and was dead in the water and the actual primary voters resurrected him and made him the nominee literally overnight. His platform is apparently what most of the party‚Äôs voters want; no one is being ignored ‚Äì he‚Äôs embraced a high minimum wage and free community college (and has even moved of 4-year). He is right of center only if you have a dramatically skewed perception of what the center is, for example using Northern European politics as your basis, which is fine for course-setting in general but an absurd baseline for strategy. The man wants to see a fairer and more just world like you do even if he doesn‚Äôt share the breadth of your vision."
6487,"You know the reason why we lost PA, MI, WI was that black turnout dropped like a rock in those states right? How exactly do you propose Amy is going to help with that."

6495,What's a pistol for then? Scratching your ass?
6496,"I was fully on board with Pete right up until he dropped out.  When Pete endorsed Biden and Biden said that he reminded him of his son it struck me.  Obviously beating Trump is #1 and Biden has now drawn more voters out in the primaries than anyone else.  With the majority of nominees that have dropped out endorsing Joe his campaign has been calm and welcoming.  It's just been a natural fit of sorts.  

Personally I would like to see lots of things addressed that I know just aren't realistic because even Bernie won't touch the topics.  So I'm just pulling for getting rid of Trump and righting the ship by repairing the damage he has done to the country and our international reputation."

We want quick information. Sound bites, flashy images, leading us to believe we can get some social (media) value or social acceptance with a Bernie vote. You don't need to actually go OUT and vote to gain that benefit, it's just the appearance. 

At the end of the day, for many of us in my age group, it isn't about actually going out to vote or choosing a candidate that will best serve us. It's about sharing on Facebook or Instagram we voted for the most hyped up candidate so that we can feel like we're smart and part of the cool kids' crew. If Biden manages to offer that image or social acceptance to this group, I bet they will jump ship.

Instead we should be focusing on moderate Republicans who could be persuaded to vote for Biden and the 12% of Bernie supporters who voted for Trump in 2016.  Because their numbers are significant enough to have potentially tipped the scales in swing states in 2016.  Remember, we elect our president state by state, most of them winner-take-all.

6546,"&gt; Votes are still coming in.


Do they honestly believe that changes anything?  The only states that still are counting ballots from Super Tuesday are Maine (98% reporting, Biden leading by 1.2% percentage points), Colorado (83% reporting, Bernie currently leading by 12.3%), Utah (78% reporting, Bernie currently leading by 17%), and California (98% reporting, Bernie leading by 7%).


None of these states are going to flip from Joe to Bernie, and Joe isn‚Äôt going to pass Bernie in any of them.  At most, they just mean a handful of delegates either way to each candidate.  It doesn‚Äôt move the needle at all.  Bernie‚Äôs still down 300 delegates.  And the Super Tuesday results ignore the fact that Bernie got demolished in Michigan, Florida, and Arizona (and is behind in the polls in every state from here on out).


I don‚Äôt hate Sanders.  But if you‚Äôre talking about ‚Äúbringing the country together‚Äù I think Joe has a lot better case to make for that.  I think if Bernie really wants to bring the country together, he needs to get behind the eventual nominee.  No more attacks which aren‚Äôt gong to change anything at all."

The other candidates are actively working to stop and prevent it. Not encourage it.
6552,"It‚Äôs fine for Biden voters to hate some of his policies, in my opinion. If this was a normal election cycle then I‚Äôd agree, but the political lines are changing and to win Joe needs as much support as possible. We have a big tent for a reason."

6559,"And my opinion is that that interpretation is reasonable. Here's a law review article on the subject (the added emphasis in *italics* is mine):

&gt; Can a former two-term President seek and serve in the vice-presidency? Non-lawyers often assume that the answer is no, and prominent constitutional scholars agree. The analysis of these experts begins with the Twelfth Amendment, which provides that ""no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States."" In addition, the Twenty-Second Amendment prohibits any twice-elected President from again securing election to that office. And because voters thus cannot put a twice-before-elected President back into the presidency, such a person is - these analysts conclude - ""ineligible to the office of President"" and therefore not ""eligible to that of Vice-President"" under the disqualifying terms of the Twelfth Amendment.

&gt; This argument *has a surface appeal*. But *it masks subtleties in the law*. The most significant complication arises because the Twelfth Amendment makes access to the vice-presidency hinge on whether the would-be candidate for that position is ""ineligible to the office of the President."" This choice of words matters because it interlocks the Twelfth Amendment not with the Twenty-Second Amendment, but with the preexisting terms of Article II, Section 1, Clause 5, which specifically address whether a person is ""eligible to the Office of the President."" What is more, the Article II clause imposes no term limit of any sort on presidential service. Instead, it requires only that a President be (1) a natural-born citizen, (2) at least thirty-five years of age, and (3) a resident of the United States for at least fourteen years. Because twice-before-elected Presidents (such as George W. Bush or Bill Clinton) continue to meet each of these three (and only three) textually specified eligibility requirements, such persons are - according to proponents of the they-can-run position - not ""ineligible"" to be President for purposes of the Twelfth Amendment. Therefore, they remain ""eligible"" to seek and to hold the vice-presidency.

&gt; To be sure, the first sentence of the Twenty-Second Amendment specifies that ""[n]o person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice."" But that clause, so the argument goes, does not address who is *""ineligible""* for the presidency; rather, it addresses only how many times an eligible person can be *""elected""* to that office. Therefore, so the argument continues, the Twenty-Second Amendment casts no light on who is ""eligible"" to be Vice-President under the Twelfth Amendment. And that is *all the more the case because a person can become President either by way of election or through other means*.

See *Boston College Law Review* article titled *""Two-Time Presidents and the Vice-Presidency""* by Dan T. Coenen"

Not going to pretend to like Biden's policies or be happy about the results
Millions of us are wrestling with what to do in November. Many are angry some enough to vote for dump ( not me but voting or 3rd party not off table.)  

I appreciate the olive branch and Hopefully Biden moves left enough to be tolerable. Healthcare and student debt are huge issues for me and other progressives so are climate channge and income inequality and marijuana Trump sucks  is certainly true but on its own wont  move enough  people to Biden. 

He needs to move left and mean it with soild proposals for both legislation and executive order. Universial health care especially now is the most important but also complex issue that needs congress. Marijuana and Student debt are the low hanging fruit that could be  fixed with executive order over the head of a tantrumimg Moscow Mitch

6573,"Welcome all, let's get moving."
6574,"Don't comment in their sub, but do upvote posts that support rational thought, like all those that are trying to explain how much worse 4 years of Trump will be than 8 of Biden."
6575,It's about time Twitter is cracking down on crap posted by the lies of Trump.
6576,"If you don't mind I am going to copy and paste an answer I made for another undecided visitor, which hits most of your questions.

Apologies in advance for the wall of text lol

For one, Joe is fundamentally a good man. Both Yang and Pete have alluded to or outright mentioned the respect that Joe had for them behind the scenes. This is also clear when you hear him talk about his late son, Beau or how he took the train home from DC to Delaware (110 miles!) every day after work to take care his family after the tragic death of his wife and daughter. He also was pushing for Gay marriage before it was legalized.

Related to the above point, he is also a unifier, which I think is sorely needed given how divided the country and how toxic the political discourse is. I think that he can unite the country following our current dumpster fire and set a foundation for the next generation of Dems like Pete, Yang, and Amy to build on. I think that Bernie vs Trump or Bernie following Trump will just pour more gas on the fire.

The other major thing to consider is electability. Hillary lost in part because the black voters didn't come out for her like they did for Obama, and Biden is very popular with that voting block. She also did poorly in the midwest, where Joe is pretty popular a well. Finally, she has been public enemy number 1 to the GOP for decades, whereas Biden is respected by a number of republicans, including Lindsey Graham(!) and is currently being supported by Kasich's campaign manager, for example.

In 2018, none of the DSA/Bernie-type candidates flipped a seat in congress from red to blue. In fact, after accounting for other factors, candidates supporting m4a performed 5 points worse than their more moderate. Bernie's victory depends on surging numbers from the 18-29 voting group, which hasn't seen any meaningful increase based on the primary turn out so far.

So Bernie will potentially struggle in Florida (see the comments on castro, venezuela), Pennsylvania (wants to ban fracking), and based on my anecdotal experience speaking to moderate dems, centrists, and moderate republicans in Virginia he will struggle here too. He will also likely harm downballot campaigns. And ultimately the president doesn't even matter if you can't keep the House blue and flip the senate.

I also have a number of problems with some of Bernie's proposals, such as national rent control, which is almost unanimously opposed by economists as it actually makes the housing problems worse.  Similarly, Bernie wants to raise some of his money using a wall street tax.  Sweden tried that tax and according to their own finance minister between 90-99% of their traders moved to London. 
https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-explains-why-a-european-financial-transaction-tax-wont-work-2011-9

In addition, he most recently proposed legislation that will tax employees on their stock when it vests, rather when they actually get that stock.  The problem is, this includes early employees at startups who are not rich, and don't even have the money that he is taxing them on yet! So these guys, who are awarded stock for taking a risk at an early stage company will either have to sell that stock (defeating the purpose/upside of joining a startup) or take out loans to pay taxes on money that they don't have.  And since 90% of startups fail, they might never have that money a their stock will become useless.

This will destroy a significant portion of the American startup scene, and result in the loss of trillions of dollars, for a tax change that will only raise $15 billion.  But it also screws some rich guys from public companies that have benefitted from using stock to pay lower tax rates.  And that, to me, encapsulates Bernie.  He is fine with other people being collateral damage if he can stick it to the rich guys.

Though there are other Sanders proposals that I find illogical, those are just a few examples where he proposes something that sounds reasonable until you actually dig in, do some research, and talk to the experts.

And finally there is just feasibility. Bernie has these big plans but still can't answer how he would get them done (after several decades in congress he has no major accomplishments to his name) or pay for them (has a $25 trillion gap between what his taxes will take in and what he proposes to spend money on) so I don't see how in practice his presidency would see anything 'bigger' than what Biden is proposing."

6582,She would never do that
6583,"Yes, but it‚Äôs hinting at something real. His spending proposals are so ridiculous that a lot of middle class and upper middle class folks can look at them and think that they‚Äôll better better off with Bernie in charge. 

Only issue is they‚Äôll never be feasible without reducing the well being of the middle class in some other ways (Taxes, deficit, broken promises, or tanking the economy through capital flight)."
6584,I see it being 284-254 as of now.  It will be a close election
6585,I think that particular pipeline also includes stops at Beto and Booker.
6586,"Yeah 2014 ended terribly, but that was a year that ended terribly for democrats all over the place. It was a single digits race in 2016 despite almost zero investment here. And then of course Beto almost made it, and down ticket other state wide candidates came close too. 
And multiple polls have shown Biden within the margin or leading Trump here. For comparison, the first poll that had Beto within single digits of Cruz had Texas democrats celebrating. So we have come a long way!"

Or maybe it would have given the apperance that he was indemnifying her to throw Trump under the bus, and it would have enraged the anti-Clinton crowd and spiked turnout. If she hadn't done what she did, there wouldn't be an investigation in the first place. Had the DNC campaigned harder in the rust belt, that could have made the difference. Had Berniebros come out... you get what Im saying. This wasn't Comey's fault, and lashing out at him now for endorsing is the definition of biting your nose to spite your face."
6592,Live YouTube streams of Joe tend to be filled with toxic Bernard brothers and Trump supporters.
6593,"Also, if you look further into her tweets she praised Biden. Said he was the best boss ever, helped her get out of an bad relationship, and she wanted to work with him again. She praised him for the Violence Against Women Act, I think even going so far as to say if he ran with that platform he would‚Äôve beaten Trump in 2016. She said if Biden was president she couldn‚Äôt wait to work for him. 

All the receipts and her debt that‚Äôs mysteriously gotten smaller have me thinking this was just an attempt to make money. That‚Äôs why even in the fairest light, Fox was still finding many inconsistencies or straight up lies she told. 

She‚Äôs jumping into the anti-Biden/Bernie Bro culture. She‚Äôs profiting off some of their stupidity, but mostly their anger."
6594,"That‚Äôs not a fallacy though because you objectively said a false thing believing it to be true and I corrected it. So I wasn‚Äôt *merely* being an Indian, I was being an Indian who had more knowledge and understanding of the socio-political nuances of India than you were."

6601,Don't even worry. Diamond Joe is the nominee after tonight. He's cleaning up!
6602,You have no idea. They were attacking Yang nonstop and then went full vulture mode when he dropped out. And then started attacking him again when all his supporters didn't magically switch over

6609,This slogan is getting pretty old. We need something new quick
6610,"Ahh gotcha.  Well there are crazy people out there, but yeah I can agree with you there."
6611,"Meanwhile, Bernie gets on the wrong plane, makes tons of mistakes, has tons of senior moments, recently had a heart attack, is the oldest candidate in the race, and so on. If we didn't want candidates acting like seniors maybe we should have choose the opposition to Trump the oldest president ever being even older than him Joe and Bernie."
6612,"I think that would hurt him immensely. I can see the media making him look like he‚Äôs running from the debate, or they would use the ‚ÄúBiden is senile‚Äù schtick to make it look like he doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening.

Keep in mind, Biden‚Äôs Super Tuesday results were not predicted to be as great as they were. Future primary predictions are in his favor, but it‚Äôs all meaningless until the primary actually happens at all. His candidacy changed within 72 hours. He‚Äôs the front runner, but he‚Äôs not leading by a lot (a lot of delegates have yet to vote anyway), and it can all change. Bernie is not going to drop out until he‚Äôs forced to do so.

Not trying to disrespect your position, but the idea that Biden and Bernie aren‚Äôt going to have to fight it out seems unrealistic and not fair to the members of the electorate who see him as still in the fight (rightfully so)."
6613,"Why does everyone think Warren would be replaced by a Republican if she were picked as VP? She's in Massachusetts for crying out loud, there's no way in hell the state goes red in this political climate."

You're the one saying that, not me. The fact you want to put false words in peoples mouth makes you no better then the bernie supporters who claim Joe wants to cut social security. Both equally wrong and both unworthy of anyone's time. Have a nice day."

6617,"Biden himself said he was the Bridge from now to a younger generation of politicians who will push for more change. Implicitly, people like Booker, Buttigieg, and so on. Biden knows and supports this, but it can't happen in an environment beset on the sides by right-wing AND revolutionary populism. That's why it needs to be him now, and them (the younger politicians) next."
6618,the same could be argued about joe himself from the last debate

6623,"Wow, 87 million ""uninsured or underinsured"" is so fucking misleading. Who the fuck knows what underinsured means here, but he clearly just put that word out there so he could make up whatever number he wanted. God, every Sanders social media post is misleading and full of loaded rhetoric."

Eh, he was born there, but spent the vast majority of his life in/representing Delaware, so he will say he‚Äôs from Delaware, similar to how Obama was born in Hawaii but if people ask where he‚Äôs from he says Chicago/Illinois, so he holds a lot more sway due to ties in Delaware...that said, he has lots of support in PA and other blue collar areas which is great news with Michigan coming up"

6651,Sounds like something Pete would think up. He and his staff were lightyears ahead of all the other campaigns when it came to digital ....
6652,"A lot of Joe's plan is good. But he is missing some key things, at least from my reading.

Is Joe behind immediate direct cash payments to all Americans? From his plan on his site it doesn't appear so, and he would use means testing for the financial assistance people can seek under his plan (which appears to be through unemployment and tax credits/refunds.). This really falls short, adds layers of bureaucratic red tape and doesn't get assistance to people who need it right now. Joe needs to immediately call upon Democrats to fully support direct recurring monthly cash payments to all Americans. The government can tax those of us who don't need it later to get it back, after this crisis is over.

On the front of unemployment insurance, it does not appear Biden is calling for unemployment to be increased to bring laid off workers back to their normal earnings (or at least close.) It might be in the plan and I may be missing it though.

His plan does not appear to address large corporations. In this speech he said they would need assistance also, but his plan doesn't lay out what kind of assistance, nor does he appear to call for stipulations on corps accepting the money such as, no stock buy backs, a government/taxpayer stake in the company until funds are repaid, and the money being earmarked for day to day operations so that the money can't be hoarded for after the pandemic.

The plan is fairly large, so again, its possible I am missing these elements in it, if somebody knows better and wishes to correct what I have said."
6653,"Except the funny part is the guy wasn‚Äôt debating gun rights. He claimed Biden was trying to destroy the second amendment and take away everyone‚Äôs guns. An easily verifiable lie. Having trouble understanding what a moral compass is, or for that fact how to form a proper sentence? ‚ÄúWhat moral, what did I say that was incorrect with a moral compass‚Äù. That‚Äôs just not how you should‚Äôve worded that. I guess the russians didn‚Äôt pay for top notch english lessons, huh?"
6654,"Online events were a HUGE part of Beto's 2018 success. Impromptu online town halls are surprisingly effective in maintaining contact with supporters, answering questions and providing a level of transparency and authenticity that's hard to come by otherwise.

I hope it becomes a trend for Democratic candidates."

6656,"I wish anybody was in charge other than the current administration. And I do mean anybody. Anybody not insane will do.

6658,That's okay. Kate Bedingfield made a statement today on behalf of the campaign.
6659,"Pete's plan -- and I'm referring specifically to the cutoff of not funding school for the rich -- always just seemed like basic common sense to me. I can't imagine genuinely arguing that I, an hourly wage worker and student, should have to subsidize the cost of schooling for someone whose parents make a million a year. Education wasn't a particularly important policy point for me, but I did/do still get totally baffled by why that idea is somehow debatable or controversial."

They won't have to set up some kind of board to do means testing; they won't have to hammer out a lot of rules around it.  It is easy and fast to just cancel loans already held by the government because the money is already loaned, so all they'd have to do is change some numbers in their computer, and they'd be putting money into the economy.

6695,Come on in. The water is warm and malarkey-free.
6696,"My best advice is to look at everything that you just said about Joe Biden and do your own independent research on those things, outside of the echo chamber."
6697,Not really. Joe might not even make it through.
6698,It's like this motherfucker wants Blue states to secede for the Union. He'd love a second civil war if it brought him more fame.
6699,"I meant WA ('this') was Sanders' strongest state left per the forecasts, not that this poll is the whole forecast.  

Joe isn't favored to win, but it's very very close and I think they said on the podcast that they've already adjusted the model to take early vote into account."
6700,"Joe‚Äôs Pence, you might say."
6701,Florida is also one of the most uneducated states in the country
6702,"They love to sit online and complain about ""fascist DNC stealing our future"" but they also think voting is lame and not worth it so they don't bother.... then complain when they don't get listened to.

The cycle cannot be broken."
6703,Credit where credit is due... that's an excellent comparison.
6704,"They‚Äôre desperate. After this Tuesday, it‚Äôs a wrap!"
6705,"Hey there, I‚Äôm just a curious European, who is following the american politics. Just one question, how come M4A is so unthinkable in the US, but works just fine in every other industrialized nation? Why wouldn‚Äòt it be possible to implement in the US, when it is possible in other countries? Is it because the tax money in the US is  mostly spread to other sectors, like the military complex? And there just isn‚Äòt enougj money left to provide healt care?"
6706,"Whatever Sanders has got is WAY more than just a couple of rude people.

At the very least 50% of his total supporter base is extremely toxic. Toxic to the point of Trump levels or beyond. 

And yes. You can judge an entire community based on their actions. Of which the entire community is bad, very bad. People have tried to warn Bernie about this and it falls on deaf ears. People have tried to warn normal or good Sanders supporters and it goes falls on deaf ears.

A groups supporters directly relate to who they support. Period."
6707,ROTR. ü§ù
6708,"Can someone disprove the allegations instead of just saying they're bullshit? Even Joe has said women deserve to be listened to, yet now that seems to not be the case with this campaign?"
6709,/r/politics exceeded my malarkey tolerance a while ago. I don't regret unsubbing there. Too much of an echo chamber.
6710,"Dude. I'm Mexican and dont vote on the U.S.A but you can help on social media, engaging with folks and re-directing people to donate.

American politics shape world politics. We are stucked with a mediocre President, Trump like idiot with Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. If Trumps falls so.does he.

Biden for President!"
6711,I originally supported Bernie until I saw how nasty his supporters are then I went to Mayor Pete and now I'm on team Biden.
6712,No doubt about it
6713,hiw could it not be? all entitlements are operated by the executive branch. Medicare is operated under the Social Security Administration.

6717,"If it was mathematically possible for him to win, than sure. But at this point, its a vanity project and he has no shot of winning and should dropout."
6718,"&gt;Forced might not be the right word. Told to get in line? Encouraged to leverage his political capital? Told to think about their political future?

Anyone following Pete closely knows that reacting how he did is completely in character. He might have discussed electoral maths and potential reactions of voters with people outside the campaign and perhaps hoped that Amy and Bloomberg would drop out, but once he saw that didn't happen his dropping out was the only way forward consistent with what he believed."
6719,#Woo Hoo!

6723,Meh.  I just take the downvotes on my perfectly reasonable comments as a badge of honor.
6724,"I doubt Bernie people would vote for Trump. Most Bernie people voted Hillary in 16, which is why Trump lost the popular vote.

The real problem is, as Michael Moore often states, Bernie people won't door knock for Biden, or volunteer on election Day. And without the help of the left at the grassroots level, Biden could very well struggle to compete against Trump campaign.

Hillary clearly struggle on her own and lost the election without participation from the left. That to me is the biggest threat.

I hope I'm wrong, maybe Biden can start a  'moderate' movement that can give Trump a run for his money."
6725,Tulsi's chances are holding nice and steady.
6726,"Nobody should be dumping on anyone or anything. This is a polite warning for those that would get into some personal beef's with new idea's.

I'll say this much, I've personally buried the hatchet and dislike I had for Harris. It's gone, out the door. If I can let it go, then anybody can let such matters go."
6727,"I agree with you completely. This forum is very positive. It seems like people exist on other forums just to discourage people from voting Trump out. Whether they are bots or American citizens I don‚Äôt know, but it‚Äôs the opposite of what we need for this country."
6728,"My husband and I are fortunate enough to still be employed and working from home right now.  I adjudicate unemployment claims for a living, so I will probably have a TON of overtime if I want it.  We will donate."
6729,"I‚Äôm 19 and you can see by my flair that I was initially a Pete supporter. I was excited to vote for Pete for many reasons but now I‚Äôm excited that Biden is our presumptive nominee. I might not even have to vote for him considering the primary could be decided by the time my state votes. But Biden has always struck me as one of the most genuine, compassionate politicians. I‚Äôm also a person who‚Äôs never fallen for pie-in-the-sky fantasy plans. I‚Äôm very data-driven so when Sanders supporters insult me for going in-depth about why Sanders‚Äô plans don‚Äôt work and *aren‚Äôt* the same plans that Denmark has, it really makes me not wanna primary for him."
6730,I prefer they're out there to let people see what Bernie supporters are really like.
6731,Literally didn't stutter a single word that I can fell. Flawless speech.
6732,Hard to see where he can make up delegates. He‚Äôll be buried in states like Florida and Georgia.
6733,It looks like Biden is pulling ahead in Texas.
6734,Literally a mod here.
6735,we already  know since yesterday
6736,"Here are some examples of what Biden has done. Not what he‚Äôs talked about, or what he‚Äôd like to do,  but tangible, actual progress that made people‚Äôs lives better: 

&gt;Joe Biden introduced and passed the first climate change bill in 1986.

&gt;Joe Biden negotiated the Paris Climate Accord.

&gt;Joe Biden led the charge to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

&gt;Joe led the efforts to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act.

&gt;Joe pushed Obama to act more quickly on same sex marriage - reached out to the gay community and pushed to/helped repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell? That was Joe Biden as VP in 2009

&gt;Joe helped lead the charge to eliminate the rape kit backlog and funding for rape kit testing.

&gt;Joe helped Obama in 2013 with the largest tax increase to the wealthy. They allowed previous tax cuts for the wealthy to expire. In doing so, they allowed the top income tax rate to rise from 35 percent to 39.6 percent.

There‚Äôs a ton more (guy‚Äôs been around awhile) but I‚Äôd put that record against anyone‚Äôs."
6737,"Better believe that Beto and his blue army will be brought to bear in Texas, like no one else can."
6738,You don't think Trump would have a field day with Bernie?  That socialist moniker is more damaging than anything Biden has.
6739,I'm not sure Joe really needs someone from the Rust Belt. He is from Pennsylvania and does very well with WWC voters. Someone a bit more liberal would balance the ticket imo.
6740,Even as someone who supports a different candidate i can really appreciate this subreddit and agree with the things that are said :)
6741,"nonono. I personally love Joe and Kamala, but Katie porter gets on my nerves. I feel like shes' ""too woke"" at this point. Idk obama warned about this sometime I think. Going after constant viral moments blasting ceos and the like is kinda problematic, especially when she tried to force commitments and agreements on live tv on the congress floor. 

I live in California, and I can easily see her winning, but I just feel like she just drips the whole ""crazy cali liberals"" vibe that gave us a pretty bad reputation overall with a lot of the rest of the country,"
6742,"And now for all the ""Hi, I'm Mike Bloomberg and Joe Biden is running for President"" ads."
6743,She literally just lost reelection there.
6744,"The union this is hilarious. Many union workers support Bernie, and also why would the general population let you ruin their chances at health care?

Biden won‚Äôt get *anything* done with education or healthcare. So even based on your points I don‚Äôt see why you would support him."
6745,I thought I was in a different thread! Sorry about that. I am getting brigaded in another thread so I was confused. I thought you were saying Biden hired the friend of Manafort. :(
6746,This is legit the most American I‚Äôve seen her act in awhile.
6747,no
6748,"Good morning!   Glad we had a good night.  CNN says Bernie is assessing his campaign.

Someone added me as a user to a troll Joe Biden forum.  Have to figure out how to report it."
6749,"No, it‚Äôs definitely not enough. What you‚Äôve done has enabled income inequality to spiral to a point where over 50% of the wealth is controlled by less than 1% of the population. Centrist democrats have CERTAINLY not done enough, and they‚Äôve had control of the party for decades. 

The fact that you can‚Äôt even acknowledge Hillary made mistakes that made her a poor candidate is ridiculous at this point. The best qualified candidate has always been and continues to be Bernie ‚Äî a man who has steadfastly stood behind progressive causes since day 1 in Congress, and whose honor is unbesmirched by cooperation with republicans on legislation that‚Äôs worsened the situations of most of the middle and lower classes.

Get off your high horse. Quit pretending throwing your support behind Biden is remotely progressive. Did we forget about his involvement in the ‚Äò94 crime bill?....."
6750,don't forget the Trump supporters
6751,Biden' health.  There is no way that Jim C and Amy K would have thrown their support behind Joe if there was issues. Neither of these two are boot lickers.
6752,"The protesters weren‚Äôt attacking Joe Biden, they were going after the microphone. 

Symone Sanders wasn‚Äôt defending Biden, but trying to stop the protesters from speaking."
6753,"I want to say ""Rally around the flag"" but if it stays like this then we're screwed. 

I don't think its set in though how Trump has managed this poorly yet. We are much behind on flattening the curve compared to other nations."
6754,"If we go back to 2000, I will not be old enough to vote. I would cheer you on from the sidelines, but I'm not sure Gore had invented the internet yet :)"
6755,Would anyone in Ann Arbor be willing to give me a ride to the rally?  I'd be happy to provide gas money.
6756,Uh huh. You're a great representation of why most of the civilized world believe Sanders voters are just as much of a cult as Trumpeters.  Good job furthering that terrible representation of your candidate.

6778,"&gt; Also I do think it's worth noting that some may have supported Tulsi either not knowing about these things or knowing about them but perhaps supporting her for other reasons.

Oh ABSOLUTELY yeah. That's a way better way of saying what I was trying to say lol. You run across too many people on twitter or whatever who stand 100% with her and know about all her stances, BUT..

..I figure a good chunk of her supporters heard a message from her that really resonated, and don't know the terrible things she's said. Especially as those didn't happen during this current election cycle. She has stances that, while I disagree with them, aren't awful or anything, and really do resonate with people.

Which is why it's really important to separate distaste for a *candidate* from your feelings toward their *supporters*, at least on an inherent level. It's a nuanced tough thing to communicate lol, and it's rough because I figure there will be Tulsi supporters reading these comments, and I don't want *them*, or at least the good-faith and anti-dictator ones, to feel attacked by my loathing of Tulsi's worst stances."

After Pete dropped out I was wavering between Warren and Biden but Pete's soft Biden support helped push me to the Biden camp."

6830,"I can't imagine how that conversation could've gone where Bernie is telling her this, and discouraging her from running (read: competing against him), where Bernie is not the asshole in the situation.

Like, yes, a woman probably has a tougher time, but Warren's smart (literally a Harvard professor) and 100% knew that already, and wanted to run running anyways.

So the only scenario I can imagine is that Bernie is using Warren's gender against her - to tell her not to run - for his own self-serving interests."
6831,"I think Sanders downfall - excuse me for invoking his name here - is that you're absolutely right.

The sooner we convert 30's and under to vote for Joe, the better a position we'll be in. Just imagine that they threw their support behind him instead of... that other guy in the general?

You know what we'd get? Numbers that not just rival Obama's, but exceed them. That's a damn fine way to send Trump packing out the White House."
6832,"I generally read papers like The Atlantic, Washington Post, Mother Jones, and Politico. Some of these are biased but I generally get good information from these sites."
6833,"I wonder why they listed him last.  

After everyone, including three people I have literally never heard of before reading their names on this ballot."
6834,That was a great read. The first time I ever voted was in 2016 when I voted for Hillary Clinton.
6835,"He doesn‚Äôt have to expose him self or put him self at risk at all. He can still lobby, advocate and raise money for covid charity‚Äôs from the safety of basement. Instead he sat on his hands for a week and then came to us with nothing. That‚Äôs not being a leader."
6836,"This is exactly the type of comment that comes across as ignorant. No one has secured the delegates needed to win the nomination, therefore Biden is absolutely still running against Bernie. Secondly, by your statement you are implying that the voters in States who have yet to hold their Primaries are meaningless and don‚Äôt get to exercise their right to vote. There are 50 states and everyone should be allowed to vote up until the delegate threshold has been met or only one person remains in the race."
6837,"1. I understand and sympathize with your healthcare concerns, but the fact of the matter is that we will not get single payer with either Biden or Bernie. The best that we can get *at this point in time* is a public option, and Biden has focused on that rather than spending political capital on single payer in order to fall short. We can't get single payer today, but we can get it tomorrow.

2. Biden isn't nearly as bad a speaker as you think. He misspeaks on occasion (due to a lifelong stutter), but watch his debate against Paul Ryan in 2012 if you want proof of what he can do. And keep in mind, Trump doesn't exactly have the soul of Oscar Wilde--the idea that he's going to flay Biden with effortless quips and jabs is wishful thinking on the part of Trump supporters (and some of the more bitter types on the left).

3. Biden just won Michigan in a landslide, so I don't think they're too worried about his trade positions."

Do you know what it's been like to be a Biden/Warren/Buttigeig/Yang supporter on Reddit over the last few years? Do you know what kinds of bullying and vitriol has been directed towards non-Bernie supporting Democrats since 2015?

Go back to r/politics or one of the pro-Bernie boards if you don't want to read negative comments about him. It's that simple."
6844,Yes she would not have left the race now if she felt she could hold Minnesota. Sanders won Minnesota in 2016 but that was a caucus. Maybe there's hope of winning it in a primary now that the field has winnowed but it may be a bit hard.
6845,Yeah I don‚Äôt like this at all. All this does is give heat to the DNC conspiracies.
6846," In January 2018, Duckworth responded to President Trump's accusations the Democrats were putting ""unlawful immigrants"" ahead of the military:

*I spent my entire adult life looking out for the well-being, the training, the equipping of the troops for whom I was responsible. Sadly, this is something that the current occupant of the Oval Office does not seem to care to do ‚Äî and I will not be lectured about what our military needs by a five-deferment draft dodger. And I have a message for Cadet Bone Spurs: If you cared about our military, you'd stop baiting Kim Jong Un into a war that could put 85,000 American troops, and millions of innocent civilians, in danger*"
6847,No. If anything this points to why we should be expanding the ability of mail-in voting.

If Warren quit in July, the new Senator (who will definitely be a Democrat and almost certainly be Joe Kennedy) would be voted on in November and take their seat like any other. 

And yes, *technically* as the law stands now Baker could appoint a Republican for those 160 days, but two things are stopping him. First, he knows his career in the state is over if he appoints a Republican, and he's already burned his bridges with the National Republican Party, so he'd be shooting himself in the foot. 

Second, the MA legislature has a Democratic supermajority, that has a history of rewriting the appointment rules to ensure any vacant Senate seats stay in Democratic hands. They've done it the last two times a Senate seat has opened up. There's no reason they wouldn't do it again."

6946,"You‚Äôre missing Biden‚Äôs commitment to spend Federal dollars to bring Medicaid to the poor in the States who didn‚Äôt cover them the way the ACA (Obamacare) hoped. 4.9 million new Americans below the poverty line would receive care under Biden‚Äôs plan and his plan also involves bringing them in and explaining their healthcare options when they interact with other parts of the social safety nets. Here‚Äôs more on that:


Expanding coverage to low-income Americans.

Access to affordable health insurance shouldn‚Äôt depend on your state‚Äôs politics. But today, state politics is getting in the way of coverage for millions of low-income Americans. Governors and state legislatures in 14 states have refused to take up the Affordable Care Act‚Äôs expansion of Medicaid eligibility, denying access to Medicaid for an estimated 4.9 million Americans.
https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-activity-around-expanding-medicaid-under-the-affordable-care-act/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel={""colId"":""Location"",""sort"":""asc""}#note-8

Biden‚Äôs plan will ensure these individuals get covered by offering premium-free access to the public option for those 4.9 million individuals who would be eligible for Medicaid but for their state‚Äôs inaction, and making sure their public option covers the full scope of Medicaid benefits. States that have already expanded Medicaid will have the choice of moving the expansion population to the premium-free public option as long as the states continue to pay their current share of the cost of covering those individuals. Additionally, Biden will ensure people making below 138% of the federal poverty level get covered. He‚Äôll do this by automatically enrolling these individuals when they interact with certain institutions (such as public schools) or other programs for low-income populations (such as SNAP).

16% of Black Americans would qualify for Medicaid if not for their state‚Äôs inaction.

Populist leaders erode the systems they rise to power in, usurping as much influence as they possibly can. Look at Putin, they're in the process of changing their constitution so he can remain president indefinitely. Trump has talked about the same thing. If Bernie wasn't going to pass in the next decade (not trying to be rude it's just statistically unlikely he makes it much longer than that), I have no difficulty imagining a world where he does the same thing with the full support of his ""Bernie or Bust""ers. 

Populists have no respect for the rule of law, the world is out to get you and they're the *only* person who can solve the problems facing us. You should give them all the power so they can save you.

It is a lame excuse. He got fewer votes. Using the lame excuse that there's more candidates this time doesn't change the point: people who voted for him in 2016 aren't voting for him now. No amount of hoops jumped through change that. He and his supporters keep talking about Sanders having a wave of youth turnout and new voters and that hasn't happened.

&gt; He called her out for supporter trade agreements which benefit corporations and harm workers. NAFTA is one. It cost American jobs.

You're not even trying to answer my point lol

&gt; What are you talking about? Sanders voted against DOMA.

Who said he did lmao

&gt; He is on tape defending gay people all the way back in the 90's, when that could have been political suicide.

It's not suicide in VT. And if it was, he'd tuck his tail between his legs just like he did for the NRA. And Bill Clinton supported gay right even before then. Sanders didn't come out for gay marriage until 2009, so don't play that game with me. 

&gt; That is a lie spread by Clinton. There was no risk of a constitutional amendment or anything like that. 

And we all know a constitutional amendment is the only way to change laws lol silly bernout.

&gt;  Don't ask don't tell was a disgrace.

Such a liar! DADT expanded gay right, period. If you have to lie and misdirect so much that itself is proof you don't even believe your own bullshit lol. Before DADT you were asked point blank when joining the military if you were gay. DADT ended that. It also meant that for the first time, it was known that gay soldiers were serving in the military, and the argument against having gay soldiers collapsed as the rebuttal was ""there already ARE gay soldiers"". Sorry, but the world didn't begin in 2016. 

&gt; Sanders supported the amber alert system, but he voted against it because of all of the extra bs that republicans tacked onto it. Even patrick leahy and william rehnquist agreed.

He voted against the AMBER alert system and writes about thinking babies 6 months old should play naked together so they can touch each other's genitals. I wonder if those are connected...

&gt; And? A D- is still a failing grade. 

lol no it's not lol. An F is a failing grade. What are you talking about lol. He's the highest graded candidate and if it was the reverse you'd be crowing about it.

6966,really? Is that just because you feel Missouri is in play?
6967,"Lmfao. Yeah. Admittedly I haven't read all of his policies, but I have read the most disagreed upon things like healthcare."
6968,"He doesn't need them, as in there are plenty of ways for him to win without them. They would help, but they aren't a reasonable use of resources and effort. Trying to convert Never Bidens is like Trump trying to convert Never Trumpers, not gonna happen. Honestly I think they just want to hurt his campaign by complaining that he isn't doing enough for them. No compromise would ever be enough for them. Bernie supporting Never Bidens are all privileged white males, willing to vote in a way that will directly harm the people they claim to be fighting for because they did not get their way (white male entitlement). Their ideology is actually nothing, it's just anger and hate, they have the same mentality as Trump supporters they just don't like Trump himself. 

Those people are the VAST minority of Bernie voters. Most are reasonable, good people who want what's best for the country even if it isn't 100% of everything they wanted. Never Bidens are just loud, mostly trolls, I don't see the point in losing any sleep over them."
6969,I see a lot of people saying they don‚Äôt care to watch the debate. I think that it is imperative that all Americans watch. Debate is a crucial part of selecting who will represent us. If Joe Biden wins he will definitely have to debate trump and that performance will matter.
6970,Yeah just stay out there fr shit getting real.
6971,"Would LOVE for Elizabeth Warren to lead the charge in the Senate for the many legislative priorities that most all the Dems who ran have in common:  Protecting and expanding healthcare, Gun reform,  Free college and expanding the Pell Grant program, Gun Reform, Taking on Climate Change, Raising Fed Min Wage, among many others.  It would be a great team and maybe we could even get Bernie to help too."
6972,If he really wants to beat Bernie he should drop out and endorse Joe.
6973,"Yeah, but did you not read the ‚Äúgo away‚Äù part?"
6974,Can we please credit team Pete on the ROTR section. It was a big part of our campaign and sub so I‚Äôd love to see it credited while being spread to everyone else.
6975,He just gave them such a wholesome makeover and they should take it and run with it.

6980,Joe should come out and say no.  No more debates.
6981,"It's not necessarily about one specific state, but it definitely is about expanding the base of support for the ticket.

I don't think Amy does particularly well with that - her support is strongly skewed towards demographics that already go for Biden. It is true that she is popular in MN, though. I think you'll have her campaigning on behalf of Joe if he is the nominee, even if she isn't VP.

I think Pete does a good general job of complementing Joe, but less state-targeted (because Indiana will likely stay red). But we saw how good he was at appealing to a broad midwestern base, more diverse than the demographics that went for Amy, including key demographics like suburban women. He also brings energy and charisma to the ticket, which I don't think Amy does particularly. However, there may be another choice out there who does all of these things \*and\* brings in some key swing state; I don't know."

6988,"Such a nonsense move. AIPAC is bi-partisan, arguably more Democrats than Republicans."
6989,Exactly. What a great week
6990,I watched Sanders press conference later at night and believe he‚Äôs setting up his exit after next Tuesday‚Äôs primaries which include Arizona and Florida. His statements today about the questions he wants to ask Biden in Sunday‚Äôs debate lead me to believe he‚Äôs paving the way for his supporters to switch over. I think even Bernie learned lessons from 2016.
6991,AYY LMAO
6992,agreed
6993,Now do Bloomberg.
6994,"Not into this negative type of stuff. It didn't work for Bernie. Its actually a big reason why he lost imo. Lets tell Bernie supporters what Joe will do for them. They seem to be a stubborn bunch, and we might not need them to win per se, but lets not go negative here. It doesnt work anyway"
6995,"Permanent member of Team Pete here, wishing you a warm welcome! One of the things I like most about the Biden crew is how welcoming they've been of supporters of other candidates, and from the comments I can see you've already experienced some of that. I'm sorry things didn't work out with Bernie, but we're glad to have you on board! We're all working towards the same goal, and I think ol' Joe will pleasantly surprise some people along the way :)"

Amazing night: Biden sweeps all states by large margins ~~Sanders drops out, Trump and Pence resign and Pelosi becomes President, the vaccine for Coronavirus is released~~"
7004,Biden will win texas and make it blue!! I agree
7005,"&gt;Given Super Tuesday's results, youth voters may be more inspired to come out and vote for Bernie. 

Hasn't Super Tuesday already shown us that the youth voters don't come out though?"
7006,"Drop out Bernie or you will spread the coronavirus!

Seriously though, I would be willing to bet a lot of people won't be willing to go to the polls right now."
7007,"I‚Äôm nervous. Bernie seemed to win the first half. Biden looked like he was lying about his record, and it made my mom almost want to vote for Bernie. He knocked it out of the park on foreign policy, though. As a Biden supporter I can see through many of Bernie‚Äôs points, although I also saw areas where Biden could have done a much better job. My fear is that undecided voters might, if not like Bernie better enough to win him the nomination, dislike Joe enough to lose him the election. Honestly I thought this was Joe‚Äôs worst debate performance of the 11 so far. I‚Äôm not trying to attack or troll, I‚Äôm just honestly a little bit dissapointed and scared."
7008,Sanders is basically Trump at this point!!!!!
7009,"This is the quote of the article for me...

&gt;""After three and a half years of this absolute asshole  in the White House, the American people just want to breathe. And I  really believe that with Biden, they know him and they feel like they  can just pause and do just that."""
7010,"Has anyone else tried joining any of Biden‚Äôs things online? I‚Äôm having issues.

Yesterday, I tried to join the Illinois virtual town hall, but after it asked me to share the link, I couldn‚Äôt find out how to actually join it.

And today, I tried to join Joe‚Äôs texting team, and it told me I had to do some training thing. I also couldn‚Äôt figure out how to actually get into it.

Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm on my phone? Do I need to be on a computer?"
7011,There's no reason Bernie shouldn't continue. Everyone sees the writing on the wall and Sanders supporters were fine with voting for Hillary.
7012,"&gt; Bernie supporters are young, fanatic, and undeterred, and will still turnout for Bernie and can tip the scales in his favor 

These people don't show up to vote. Even less of them will show up during a pandemic. Bernie is very likely to get steamrolled by Biden in the remaining primary states. True, much of Biden's support comes from older folks- but way more of them will still show up to the polls than young people. Bernie needs to immediately suspend his campaign and the remaining primary elections should be canceled. By not doing so, he is putting millions of people at risk, just so he can get a handful more delegates. It's beyond selfish."

Independent voters owe nothing to the dem party. How is your candidate going to win them over in the general?

7020,If the Dream Team wins Texas tomorrow it‚Äôs going to swing even harder.
7021,"It‚Äôs all still fluid.  Only half of the delegates are awarded based on the popular vote of the state.  The other half are given based on the individual results in each congressional district.


So it will take days to determine which candidates are viable in each congressional district that voted and determine the exact allocation of delegates.  The statewide popular vote totals are really just rough estimates to determine who won."
7022,Me too man. I have to wait. :(
7023,She has some campaign finance baggage that makes me nervous.
7024,I'm almost certain the Biden team is vetting the VP shortlist right now.
7025,"I used to maintain more of a benefit-of-the-doubt mindset with Bernie, like, ""I disagree with some of his beliefs but I respect that he seems to be honest about it.""

This election season so far has eroded that faith in him as a person. He's been nothing but an egotistical jackass who refuses to compromise with anyone and who continues to run even though, statistically speaking, a man his age who just suffered a heart attack has a *very real* chance of not even surviving his first term! 

Anyone not in love with themselves would realize they need to bow out and support a healthier progressive alternative (like Warren). But no, not Our Lord And Savior Saint Bernard. I'll vote for him if he's the nominee, but I'm done trying to like him for the sake of diplomacy."
7026,"I'm a life long republican who intends to vote libertarian in this coming election. I'm coming by to say Congrats on the big night y'all! I'd love for Biden to win the Dem nomination and maybe even the general. However, I like knowing that y'all are getting out and voting to hold your ground against the Bernie Bros who attempting to radicalize your party. As someone who supported Trump in 2016, I see a lot of the similarities between Bernie's cult-like personality (which is building up, just like Trump's did) and Trump's. Unlike trump though, Bernie isn't reveling in it and fanning the flames for extremist but nor is he not doing anything too distant himself from the extremist. It's a dangerous path and I only hope Biden gets the nomination. For your sake and our country's sake."
7027,No Tulsi Gabbard?

the republicans practically wanted to remove him from office, it was incredible, it was almost as bad as That Time Obama Saluted While Holding Starbucks Because He Hates America"
7032,"He hasn't won older voters in a race against Joe Biden.  I think the calculation on Bernie's part would be that since older voters vote more reliably, they would be more likely to show up and ""vote blue no matter who"".  So then it would be about doing well with young voters, which Bernie does.  And I'll admit the numbers haven't been great in the primary, but that isn't necessarily a great predictor for the general. 

I think either way is a risk, and I understand why people feel like Biden is the ""safe"" choice.  I just don't know if the Democratic party can survive another loss to Trump, no matter who the nominee is"
7033,"I say this as a woman who‚Äôd love to see a woman in the WH but it has to be Pete. He‚Äôs brilliant &amp; I believe he‚Äôd work great with Biden. Pete has proven that he can turn out non voters &amp; future former R‚Äôs. He scored high in all demographics except with minority voters but Biden has the strong minority support. And people forget that Pete is LGBTQ which would be groundbreaking as a VP candidate. We need Warren in the senate because if we flip it, she‚Äôd be a fantastic majority leader. I love Kamala but I love her more as AG serving up sweet justice. We‚Äôre lucky to have so many brilliant D‚Äôs to help put our democracy back together."

Also,

7068,"I don't think he needs a progressive VP.

8% of democrats say they won't vote for Biden if he's the nominee.  That's standard numbers.  Biden needs a moderate to consolidate the suburban vote and to show himself as the unity candidate, not of the party, but of the country."
7069,"It explains the reason Sanders support is dropping. Trying to primary President Obama, railing against the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù, no major Senate endorsements, painting SC and other African American voters as low information voters, his angry rhetoric against the Democratic agenda shows a unwillingness to compromise and his supporters mean spirited attacks on the other candidates."

I will never believe a gay man endorsed someone as anti lgbt as Biden for any reason other than money/power. It just makes my brain go completely numb as to what went through Pete‚Äôs mind. 

Same goes for Yang, his delayed endorsement just seems like him worrying about his own ass, as opposed to immediately endorsing the candidate with similar plans to his."
7076,Yesss!
7077,"I'm really happy he said he'd choose a female and am in full support of it but ever since Andrew Cuomo has gotten popularity nationwide; man... what a great VP he would make.

7078,"&gt; If you look at the numbers, Biden hasn't actually been increasing the numbers of AA voters over Hillary. Can't count on enthusiasm in the general.

7079,Welcome to the team! Team Biden is becoming a big tent for sure :)
7080,Two Senate seats up in 2020 so it would be amazing to win the state.
7081,"Agreed on your breakdown.
I think there are many Republicans in suburban areas that will not admit it publicly, or even to themselves, but will end up voting Biden in the voting booth. Kind of a reverse of the Obama to Trump, more like an large spike in the Romney to Clinton voter demographic."
7082,Part of the problem is that non-Bernie people were getting shouted down during the primary and now a lot of Bernie people think that Democrats don‚Äôt like a lot of policies that are extremely popular because no one was telling them what they thought anymore.
7083,"I personally don't care if they own stocks, but what I'm talking about is what's been happening recently where some Senators sold stock after a closed door corona virus  meeting. That's actually what I'm referring to.

However, what I am against is no the ownership of stock, but the selling/buying at opportune time based on what appears to be non public information.

I would be in favor of making all investment shares bought having to be broad market shares like S&amp;P500 etf shares, but I would still allow them to own shares in a business they started I suppose."

Endorsing Biden only makes him get more GOP attention. He could've not endorsed anyone. The fact he chose to endorse Biden means something. For those too lazy to click the link, here is his statement.

 ‚ÄúWe need a strong voice for rural America in the White House, and Joe Biden has demonstrated that he cares about agriculture, our rural communities and economy. I believe Joe will focus on rural health care, strengthen education and job training opportunities and he's the right candidate with the broad coalition, the experience of achieving results, and the ability to unite our country to get it done. I'm proud to support Joe Biden for president because I believe he will be good for rural America.‚Äù"

7095,"Not saying he will or won't, but if he skipped the debates, he'd look very weak. Joe would probably show up and stand next to an empty podium to really drive the point home. It would probably be better to show up and do poorly than chicken out altogether. I don't think anyone has missed a debate since they started televising them."
7096,"Let me get this straight.... you voted for Trump, and you're saying you will do it again is Joe is nominated....


And you want is to take you seriously?"
7097,"Believe me, voting is not the issue. The way you're talking makes me think you're adhering to social distancing recommendations (I am too).... most people aren't unfortunately.

7107,You can do both.
7108,"It seems to be the thing now, since people miss in person events. But, I'd much rather have people (not just Biden) make a polished video and then just upload it."
7109,Joe overperformed so hard that it literally broke 538!

7112,Yes! üëçüèº
7113,Bernie doesn‚Äôt need teleprompters (or diapers)
7114,"Well, Harris adds racial diversity to the ticket. Some black voters might feel a little taken for granted, seeing how pivotal they were in Biden's comeback.

Klobuchar also has numerous controversies (abusing her staff, prosecutorial record, etc.)."
7115,"Endorsement is not a simple gesture. Behind the scene, generally there would be a discussion / negotiation with the winning campaign before endorsement is made. I imagine Warren would like Joe's agreement to adopting a few of her stances on issues."
7116,"Seriously. Sanders is going to get crushed tomorrow in the three states still voting and I'm praying he drops out. It's just dangerous at this point for him to keep going, he's really putting people at risk."
7117,The Bloomberg threat got to them didn‚Äôt it ?
7118,"We all make mistakes or choices that we later (or sooner) regret, even in the voting booth. Make a few calls into Michigan for Joe and I bet you'll feel better!"
7119,"It makes total sense to send her to Michigan as the senator of another Great Lakes state.  Either she‚Äôs been promised a position, or it proves how much of a team player she truly is."
7120,"A friend of mine who‚Äôs in the tank for Sanders finally let the cracks show last night. 

‚ÄúWhy are you so hard on Sanders! He marched for civil rights!‚Äù

Before any of you ask, yes. Yes, he is."
7121,"Biden Klob makes more sense.  Biden has PA and down the East, West is solid blue and Klob can get MN, WI, IA and MI.  Both times a MN VP was used we won.  HHH and Mondale."
7122,"Thanks for keeping us in line! I've been doing a lot of arguing with Sanders supporters today on r/politics, and while I haven't been rude or anything, at a certain point, relentlessly trying to argue with them doesn't really do much good. I'm glad that people on here encourage us to be our better selves. I can see how in communities where it is the opposite, people can get really ugly really fast."
7123,"McCain wanted to pick Joe Lieberman,  to be fair."
7124,"Or if you also have underlying conditions such as diabetes or asthma. I'm young and relatively healthy but have asthma and had a pretty bad cold two weeks ago and could barely breathe, I can't imagine how Corona would affect me.

Not to mention living with elderly. Plenty of family in my home are elderly and I am incredibly scared for their well-being and question if they will survive corona if contracted."
7125,Bernie already said no on Maddow.
7126,You're right. I'm sorry.
7127,"Well, he foremost has to be elected first and having a working majority in the Senate. I do, however, have faith in VEEP Biden that he‚Äôll push for a $15/hour minimum wage, expand the ACA, decriminalize marijuana and other drugs, etc. And I say this as someone who identifies himself as a progressive. 

At the same time, however, I don‚Äôt look eye-to-eye on every issue with Biden but not only do I have respect for him, I agree with him on principle, and have faith he‚Äôll do what‚Äôs right."
7128,"&gt;are afraid of ending up like China or Cuba with Bernie as president, and he keeps arguing ""well it's not ALL bad""... it doesn't matter if it's all bad. If your husband beats you and takes all your money and you stay because he'll kill you if you leave, but takes you on nice vacations, how would you like if it someone kept bringing up how the vacations make it all kinda worth it? It shows he doesn't truly understand the gravity of it and wouldn't really see a problem with the US heading that direction.

I can understand where you're coming from, but I don't think that you're reading it correctly. A more apt analogy would be: You go to the mechanic with your car because, although it runs, your engine tends to overheat or something (not a car guy). Once you get there you see another car, this car is made of scrap, it is shitty and does not even move. The owner of this car was the wife beater lad from your example. Now, this lad's car has a hell of an engine inside of it, and that is the only quality piece in it. Can't you take its engine and put it on yours?  By doing so you're not saying the owner is a good guy, you're not saying the car is a good car, all you're acknowledging is: the engine is what it is, a good engine."
7129,I really dislike it that Bloomberg did better than Warren. Ugh.
7130,"Holy spark lines, Batman!"
7131,"For sure, I like the Banksy style stencil logo. Most campaign shirts are usually pretty generic. Lol, must of been an interesting moment in your relationship XD. Man, 2016 was something else. Anyway, thanks for the response, have a great weekend."
7132,I'm not going to humor organized trolling efforts.
7133,I don‚Äôt understand how Trump is going to ‚Äúreopen‚Äù the economy when he passed the buck to local governors and mayors to shut it down in the first place.
7134,"&gt;Seemed like a toss-up to me

I think most would agree which is why Biden won. The front-runner is the defacto winner for toss-ups because they maintain their lead."
7135,"Signed up for an organizing event with Jill Biden next week and imma be real, about 50% of why is because I'm pretty sure if she wanted to she could END me"
7136,"Ohio's state supreme court made an overnight ruling that officially confirms the delay, so no polling locations will be open."
7137,We are definitely not on the same team.
7138,"Education costs *are* grossly out of control. Healthcare is woefully inadequate in the United States. Bernie brings up many critical issues that desperately need to be addressed. 

But when something sounds too good to be true...well, it is. Not ""usually is"". Just is. Period. 

Otherwise I'd be drowning in hot local singles and additional downloaded RAM. ü§î"
7139,"I'm a postgrad student studying deep learning, and I think AI researchers are more aware than the general public that most forecasts of how many jobs will be lost through automation are wildly overblown. 

Firstly its a lot easier to automate a core task of a job, than it is to automate the entire job (many automation forecasts focus on tasks), and secondly most predictions of how long it will take to achieve  challenging AI milestones that can automate major sectors like level 4 autonomous driving are extremely optimistic. In 2018 major car manufacturers were talking about how they would start selling fully autonomous cars by 2022-2024, nobody is saying that now that the true difficulty of the task has become apparent.

This kind of thing is why ideas like UBI come from the right place, but are about 30 years ahead of their time."
7140,\*head-desk\* I apologize
7141,Right. But those aren‚Äôt the voters we need to focus on. It‚Äôs the people in the middle.
7142,The upvoting US-Flags turned me complete Biden a few hours ago.
7143,"Naturally. A vote for the lesser evil. Too bad, we could've got an honest President who fights for what he believes in.

House of Reps &amp; Senates‚Äô new blood is much needed."
7144,"&gt;Right so now you want to kill Biden.
&gt;
&gt;You want voters to die and you want Biden dead.


I don't. Please show me where I said so.


&gt;This is why Bernie is losing. Voters are sick and tired of your insane threats.
 
What threat did I make?"
7145,Welcome! A lot of us come from different candidates or parties. We are really glad to have you.
7146,"I'm a Bernie guy and I know a Swan Song when I hear one. 

I expect Bernie just wants to test Joe a little in the 1v1 debate. Assuming Joe does average, I imagine Bernie drops if he gets romped again next week which is looking likely. 

If Bernie ""goes easy"" on Joe on Sunday, I am 100% sure that is what's happening in Bernie's head."
7147,If there's anything we can learn from Republicans blindly backing their party it's that they get the SC justices they want. So important that we elect a Democrat this year and flip some Senate seats!
7148,"With undecided voters and soft support for other voters, Biden can win way more than minimum of 15%. He can and will close the gap behind Sanders within single digits."
7149,"2010 Senate Race, in which Romanoff won in a landslide at the state convention and then lost to Bennet in the primary.  Bennet was supported by the DSCC.

In the 2018 Governor race, Cary Kennedy won in a landslide at caucus, but hundred millionaire Jared Polis inundated the race with ads and won.  Awkward to say in this context, but I supported Polis over her."
7150,"&gt;How come when people see the rising costs of drugs everyone loses their shit about drug companies, but when people see rising college costs no one scrutinizes how colleges are spending that money?

I'm gonna be honest with you, I'm a little unironically shook rn by that comparison"
7151,"for a while, at least, idk about that long"
7152,‚ÄúYou people‚Äù.... You sound like Joe Biden talking about black folks in the 1980‚Äôs. So much for unity in the party...

7154,"I'd say welcome, but we've really been on the same side all along."
7155,This is just awesome through the roof. The artist is just fantastic.
7156,"Yang supporter here. I know how it feels. The Bernie Bros come out in full force when a candidate drops out...and they assume you‚Äôre automatically on their team. It‚Äôs either rude comments or fake candidate compliment + ‚Äúfeel the bern‚Äù.

I also have reservations about Biden, but I feel like he‚Äôs the best viable option, without question. Biden knows how to pick a VP and a cabinet. He has extensive foreign policy knowledge and connections (which become invaluable in rebuilding the relationships broken over the last three years). Biden and Pete are the only candidates I‚Äôve seen address Yang‚Äôs automation concerns... we need a president who understands our rapidly changing economy. 

I was worried about his viability in the primaries, but SC solidified my belief that he can unite people. I donated to Biden after seeing his victory and will do everything I can to help him get the nomination."
7157,"To be fair, longer lines can be a form of voter suppression. That can happen if voting locations are shut down within a district, for example. But that‚Äôs more likely to affect people of color a.k.a. Biden voters."

7168,"Right? I couldn't believe how fast Symone got up there. And I love that later she tweeted ""I broke a nail""."
7169,So it doesn‚Äôt get you anything. He will get NY anyway and it does nothing to help with the female vote. Klobuchar would put a swing state in play and attract people who want to see a woman on the ticket.
7170,No malarkey mr Biden
7171,"Pretty marginally, he has 100% name ID."
7172,These deep fakes are getting good.
7173,"I would argue that if you prefer libertarian, you have a very good reason to vote for Biden. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is going to retire this year, leaving a Supreme Court seat open for a potential Trump to fill with a far right wing judge. The court is already leaning strongly to the right.

I‚Äôd choose a different election cycle to vote for the LP, in your case. Maybe donate instead?"
7174,Bro stfu. Idgaf. Bernie aint doing his job in the senate. We dont pay him to have youtube livestreams we pay him to be a senator.
7175,Our online presence is very poor. Any ideas? Any recruiters out there? I have graphic design experience and.. not much work to do right now... will work for free at the moment...
7176,"Sure, but we can‚Äôt make the mistake Hillary made and not campaign there. Biden definitely shouldn‚Äôt write it off."
7177,This will all be irrelevant because Trump is getting elected again
7178,"It‚Äôs fine, don‚Äôt worry"
7179,Kudos to her for hanging in there. She's a fighter on many fronts.
7180,üëèüëèüëèüëè same but lesbian
7181,"I'll be honest, I need to look into what Bidens positions are. I know he wants to expand the ACA rather than move to single payer but that's about it. I prefer single payer."
7182,I think this is the logical approach if the goal is to beat Trump but continue to push progressive ideas.  Seems clear to me that Bernie and his supports have moved the Democratic platform progressively in 2016 and certainly with Biden.
7183,That would be deeply disappointing.
7184,"You should definitely vote third party. And go join a third party and leave our party alone, ‚ÄòKay?"
7185,"Why don‚Äôt you trust him? I‚Äôm genuinely curious. 

And why do you trust Biden? He tried to lie and say Bernie had superpacs, so I can‚Äôt trust him. 

Please don‚Äôt just make another sarcastic remark... I would love a real reason to vote Biden, but I don‚Äôt see one."
7186,I'm unaffiliated but tend to vote blue more than red and I got skewered last night talking with some Bernie folks for saying not all Republicans are Trump people and I'm absolutely interested in working together vs continuing to beat each other over the head with clubs. It made me so sad.
7187,OK Bernie voter here saying people saying there is rumors Yang could be Bidens pick for VP? any truth to this? as Yang would of been my first choice
7188,"we had 326 subscribers yesterday, but we had a few hundred within the few days before that, and it looks like we'll get a few hundred today."
7189,Plus trumps people are starting up now
7190,"Trump will for sure, but he'd find stuff to pick on for any of the democratic candidates. Pete made this point in one of the debates."
7191,I agree with this take. It makes Joe seem more like a man of the people and a little exciting and strong willed. Things people want to see opposite Trump. The AR14 bit plays into the narratives with him from some but people will want to hear the clip entirely and in doing so will hear his correction.

7193,"I have to admit, I have been experiencing so much anger from Bernie supporters online and IRL that I sometimes forget we should be conscious of all the other non toxic Bernie supporters who just like their candidate like the rest of us. 

Thanks for reminding me!"
7194,"The definition has actually changed to include the colloquial usage: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/literally

I personally am not a fan but OP is actually using it correctly."
7195,It‚Äôs going to be a clean sweep
7196,Surprised they skipped the quote about people getting better while going to work
7197,"Yeah, but Biden is just pretty lousy overall. Let's face it, he has no real interest in helping the American people. 

He just wants to be elected under the guise of doing so."
7198,"IMO it wouldn't be good for Pete or Beto anyways.  VP is a dead end and they have so much then can do.  Tammy Duckworth would be a solid pick.  Women, vet and a fighter."
7199,"Here‚Äôs what got me: what does Joe Biden get out of running for President at this stage in his life? Hell I‚Äôm in my mid 40s and I‚Äôm already freaking tired and ready to retire if I could get away with it. I only have a granddog not any grandkids to go plant bulbs in the garden with and make sugar cookies and shit but even still I don‚Äôt see the appeal of being President at ALL, Joe sure doesn‚Äôt need the money and he can‚Äôt care about the power, the man is literally sacrificing the last peaceful years of his life to save the Democrats."
7200,"Bernie supporter here - saw the full video. Yes, the clip that is being circulated around is misleading. I'll also help voice that in there. Not cool."
7201,"Wonder if it's worth making a stickied thread with corrections to misinformation or the historical context to votes that are frowned upon today. Also policy bullet points.

Then we can just link that to any on the fence Sanders supporters and focus on Trump. What they do with the information is ultimately up to them."
7202,"Jesus Biden supporters.

If your guy wins today, the Bernie supporters need to vote for your guy in the general.  Stop isolating them, particularly when theyre trying to build bridges.  And especially when there are absolutely zero policies Biden is pushing to attract them.  In swing states some people will be standing in line for 5 hours in November.  You have to make it worth their while.  Especially in areas where not one Biden volunteer has darkened their door.  These are weaknesses in his campaign and you will have to overcome them to unify the party and generate turnout.

He came in here trying to open a dialogue.  Stop insulting him.

The future of the planet is in your hands- stop fighting and focus."

7204,"From 538, and I think it just about summarizes the night in one image: [https://imgur.com/a/TdeXSRX](https://imgur.com/a/TdeXSRX)"
7205,"I‚Äôm really not trying to be a jerk, but you west of the ocean?"
7206,"TYT and The Hill are what I call the ""Purity Test Left."" They are bad faith actors using intellectually dishonest rhetoric to gain a modicum of power. They reject any progressive idea if it didn't come from their cult leader. In this case Sanders. The attacks on Yang once he did what he said he would do (support the nominee) were particularly vicious. The attacks on Warren were incredible. The smug entitlement they project because they have a couple hundred thousand views on ""The YouTube"" is disturbing. 

Fortunately, voters are rejecting these sycophants. Just look to Cenk Uygur's congressional campaign. An absolute disaster. Even Bernie withdrew his endorsement because of Cenk's hideous reputation.  Krystal Ball is being called out for using populism to pander while forming a PAC funded by a billionaire. And regular voters are rejecting Kyle Kulinski calling everyone who didn't vote the way he did ""normie democrats"" or ""low information"" voters. 

There is a vacuum on the left that needs to be filled with good faith actors. Populism is a fine ideology to start, but co-oping populism to run hate campaigns will only set the movement back decades."
7207,Oh $10k student loan debt would be almost 1/3 if the debt of most people I know (including myself).
7208,"&gt;Overturning citizens United is maybe my top issue.

That's not happening for years, if not decades, even if Sanders were to become President. It will require a constitutional amendment and Democrats aren't going to control enough state legislatures in the near future to push one through."
7209,Not a moment too soon.
7210,"I never said Bernie isnt a capitalist and hes not officially part of a single party (registered independent). Furthermore he absolutely is an FDR Democrat, just google Social Democracy and that defination fits more with what Bernie is than actual Democratic Socialism (at least by the traditional defination of the two terms). 

""Social democracy is a political, social and economic philosophy that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal democratic polity and a capitalist-oriented economy.""

When has Bernie actually made any arguement or action since being in any position of power that would involve post-capitalism?"
7211,Oh ok my bad
7212,"Thanks! I did see an article about late decision voters. I wonder how this will effect Florida. I knew a few R's who were excited by Biden's momentum and went out last minute to vote for him, so not so much a last minute decision on which candidate, more a last minute decision to vote in the primary at all. But that's in Massachusetts where even our Republicans are relatively moderate."
7213,"Tides may actually shift, if Biden starts sniffing kids again he may turn people off"
7214,make sure you vote
7215,"What is this like 2 electoral votes or something? Still, I would love to take the Senate."
7216,"&gt; He voted against that multiple times.

When?"
7217,"As someone who has seen the extreme excesses and failings of capitalism with extensive curruption in my local govence and a government who is willing to enslave a generation to pay for the previous, I am only voting Biden, Because bernie isn‚Äôt going to make it and I am not a dense martyr..

7225,Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt care about a bunch of twitter malarkey.
7226,"all opinions are manufactured, we are not born with opinions.  Parties and candidates need to make their case and voters need to vote. I have zero sympathy for those that choose not to vote because the candidates aren't perfect for them. It's short sighted and selfish."

7236,"Dont believe them. The most recent ""accusation"" was just another pathetic attempt to discredit Biden.

She also accused him last year and it was quickly proven to be false. She has ties to Russia. 

Also notice how most anti-Biden hashtags on twitter trend in the middle of the night in the US? Its because at that time its around morning in Russia and Russian bots have been supporting Bernie since the beginning so..."
7237,I am going to say that parties are gate keepers who serve a role in democracy. Making a process more democratic might not lead to better outcomes or might even lead to the exclusion of socially marginalized or disenfranchised groups. You should listen to the 538 primaries project if you want a good analysis of why we have our weird system of primaries in the US. No other democracy really does what we do. And what we do is nuts.
7238,"Of course what somebody cares to discuss matters. Open conversation about Biden, his appearances, speeches and his policies are the vehicles to cultivating and expanding support. Sometimes support and a vote commitment is immediate and other times it can take a bit."
7239,"This, right here, is how you really make it in politics.  You make sure that the people you interact with know that when they speak, you listen and you care.  A Biden administration would be a compassionate one.  

This is also how you build integral connections and allies on the Hill.  I would expect his White House Office of Legislative Affairs to be an exceptional one (Between the Branches, by Kenneth Collier is a great book about how presidents use ‚Äî or fail to use ‚Äî this office effectively)."
7240,"But it may reaffirm for people that are feeling defeated by Hunter/Ukraine ads, and feeling unmotivated to vote that Trump IS in fact much much worse."

7245,"Wow, as one of his supporters Bernie still wants to fight for you. He's not an idiot and you should have more faith in him. He knows he won't be the nominee and what he is trying to do and the point you clearly missed is that he wants to try and pull Biden a little more left and get him more on board with the things you were supposedly supporting Bernie for."
7246,I was reading an article yesterday and our WA Secretary of State predicted final turnout here will be over 50% which is bonkers for a primary. Only 30% of ballots had been returned as of Friday evening so there is still a TON of vote left to be cast and received.
7247,"Texas wow. I really think no matter what now going forward I‚Äôll be voting Bernie in my primary (sorry I want the party to go more to the left and I want bernie to have a strong voice at the table come the convention) but if Uncle Joe wins Texas. Fuck, turn off the lights the party‚Äôs over. I don‚Äôt see how Bernie goes into the convention with more delegates than Uncle Joe. That being said I will be donating the max to whoever the democratic candidate is and will be voting for them too"
7248,Other than people losing jobs what would be so bad about it? Let's pretend all those people were re-trained and helped to find new jobs. Maybe half would stay as part of the public insurance? What is bad about it?
7249,"That‚Äôs not the kind of seizure that Marx talks about. So it‚Äôs not Marxism.

You might disagree with it, but it doesn‚Äôt make it Marxism."
7250,"It wont matter.  Bernie tried to corral his voters to help Hillary.  Bernie doesnt own his voters, they are loyal to his policies, not the man.  If Biden doesn't bend, he will lose the same way Hillary did."
7251,His message is conflicting.   Establishment is against you and go out and vote.   Why vote if they are against me?   Bernie has done a lot of damage with his demagoguing.
7252,"they don't give a shit about what you want, they just want your vote."
7253,"Sorry I don't see it.  Joe says he has respect for Bernie and his supporters, but disagrees with the approach they are taking.  That isn't dismissive.  I think we all have very similar goals, but the difference is in the way to go about getting to better healthcare, etc."
7254,"He will lose, mark my words"
7255,Nice...
7256,"Ugh, bla bla treatment bla bla helping those in need etc etc BOOORING!

How about CASH? I want a populist candidate to tell me that he's going to give me $2000, when he knows damn well that he has no authority to do it."
7257,I would cream my pants if Texas goes blue
7258,Yo hold up. Let‚Äôs not criticize Bernie for wanting to achieve universal health coverage and affordable college tuition. I would hope we all share this goal
7259,"This is a dumb meme, the Romans relied heavily on slaves."
7260,Identity politics may suck but that doesn't mean the unfortunate reality should be ignored.
7261,I agree with you as well. Maybe there are some influential people out there who can push Tammy Duckworth's name out to the campaign.
7262,Biden needs to drop out to avoid a brokered convention.
7263,"He has a stutter and he always trips over his words, but he's still sharp. Like even people harping in him for that South Africa ""arrest"", they try to frame it as him forgetting and being somehow senile but he just called being held by the police being arrested, then corrected himself when people saw there wasn't an actual address. Just follow him when he stutters, he knows his numbers and he knows his stuff.

Thanks for voting for a better future for this country!"
7264,Why is he using a spoon to eat an ice cream cone?! Lmao!
7265,"I don't think anyone here would say that Bernie has no place in the race. He has a large minority of the votes and support. People would just prefer the unity process start sooner rather than later. In 2016, Bernie staying in until long after he was eliminated caused accusations that he is responsible for the lack of unity that was a significant factor in leading to Clinton's loss"
7266,"If it were somebody transformational like Michelle Obama, black turnout would be big enough to flip it. But having Stacey Abrams who has spent the last 2 years studying turnout mechanisms in GA would help."
7267,"Number one reason to be honest is electability. I think the sanders campaign rests on overestimating the number of young voters who will turn out (there‚Äôs been no evidence so far this primary) and underestimates the amount of moderates. I just don‚Äôt see a good electoral college path forward for him, and I worry he‚Äôll tank us in the house where moderates power our majority, and in the senate where we need to win in the south to win.

I also think that an underrated problem  of the trump presidency is the way he has gutted our executive bureaucracy and harmed our relationships with allies. We need someone with a ton of experience to get in there and get our government back to a functional place, as well as restore the US on the world stage."
7268,"&gt;She only ""made it the longest"" by virtue of staying in so long

Uhh. Yeah. That's what it means to 'make it the longest' in the race."
7269,Aww I think you got lost buddy. Need some help with that moral compass of yours?
7270,Former yang gang for Biden!
7271,Fingers crossed. In 2016 Clinton was polling way higher than Bernie in Michigan but she lost. Everyone vote!!
7272,"This is a big problem with our side of the aisle. Hhe failed to demonstrate he has an understanding of the nuance of the conversation.

AR-15s are essentially the same thing as handguns just with the long barrel. Comparing them to machine guns is disingenuous at best. they don't fire any quicker or slower than a handgun, many take calibers comparable to handguns, and really the only thing making them slightly more dangerous than a handgun is the fact that has a barrel.

the fact of the matter is that if Democrats were to focus more on actual preventive measures such as universal background checks and robust red flag laws, then liberal gun owners, Independence, and conservatives could potentially get behind us easier."
7273,it's pandering i think

7277,"&gt;Yup. 

Really? That's terrible. Surely you have evidence to back this up?

&gt;And we will vote and you will lose. Congratulations!

You're probably right.  But as long as Bernie has a chance, I won't blame him for trying.  Same goes for any candidate.  Why? Cause I believe in democracy."

7284,"True, it was probably unfair to call them insane, even if I said only it‚Äôs only some. I just wish that people wouldn‚Äôt be such sore losers; I hate the situation Bernie is in right now, but seeing people say that they would rather have 4 years of Trump (the literal polar opposite of Bernie in policy, except for trade deals) as opposed to 4 years of Biden (who is in between Trump and Bernie, but still way closer to Bernie than trump is obviously lol) just made me feel upset. I get it, our guy isn‚Äôt winning, but don‚Äôt be complacent with someone 10x worse than Biden just to ‚Äúprove a point‚Äù to the DNC"

7292,"I don't think it's pandering, I think the democratic mainstream is getting behind student debt reduction.  It may be hard to see the connection to coronavirus, but since we're passing economic stimulus right now, it makes sense to start with the policies that should be done anyways.  Since you're a Yang guy, here are proposals from his site:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Immediately reduce the student loan payments for millions of Americans by ensuring that the American government does not profit one cent from its educational loan servicing and that students get the same interest rates as the wealthiest bank. Any profit that the government does realize will go into reducing rates the following year until profit is zero.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Explore a blanket partial **reduction in the principal of school loans**, especially for recent graduates with the largest debt levels‚Äîthe ‚ÄúBailout for the People‚Äù‚Äîand forgiveness for debt beyond a certain period after graduation.   
&gt;

I fear for democracy if Sanders gets the nomination, not because he's ""inconsistent"" (although he is, and ineffective as well, compared to Biden or literally any other candidate) but because then democracy will have been reduced to ""who can yell the loudest and bully the other candidates into submission"" and that's no longer a democracy."

7318,"Ok, so I'll retract that part. I will vote for Biden if it is him vs Trump. 

Obviously I don't want 4 more years of ignorance. That being said, I am not jumping out of my seat for 4 years of status quo. 

Yes his voting record is consistent with mainstream democratic values. It doesn't need to be propaganda if there is a dramatically more progressive candidate available with an equally impressive following to a former vice president. Maybe it's not the opposite of democratic values, but I have more respect for someone who is willing to speak of values before they are popular. Biden didn't have to sacrifice any popularity for the good or the bad policies that he voted for, because he voted with the mainstream. Bernie voted for the values that we still support now at the expense of his own popularity, and then still today in 2020, he has just as powerful of a movement without the power of the establishment or billionaires backing him. It's the people's movement, not a likable career move."
7319,"Yeah sorry, I was responding to someone in a different thread about climate change and thought it was you lol."
7320,"The fact you use the infamous WHO study just shows how clueless you are. One of the principle authors demanded his name be removed from it and wrote [this] (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)13408-3/fulltext). Cliff notes are he says the methodology was so bad the results are ""meaningless"". Ranking healthcare systems this way is hard and experts generally don't like doing it for this exact reason. These rankings usually come from healthcare advocacy groups like the Commonwealth Fund. They use tricks like using life expecting at birth (not a healthcare outcome in the developed world) and infant mortality (measured vastly differently from country to country). Also Americas high suicide rate is largely responsible for their higher mortality rate.

But let's get back to the point. You're not saying US is terrible from a worldwide viewpoint. We can now agree. It outperforms Europe on some healthcare _outcomes_ and is outperformed by some of the richest OECD countries on others. But you're original point was about living standards:

&gt;What I mean by catching up is literally that, catching up. America is trailing the 31 first world countries in every category besides business and economy related things. Education? Bad. Personal freedom? Bad. Social security? Awful. Environment? Bad. Safety? Awful. Health? Beyond awful. I don't know in what world you are living, but the US haven't been at the top in terms of living standards in a long time and are still declining (or progressing slower than other countries).

And I already showed pages ago that this is dead wrong."
7321,"I run a blood bank.  

The gay blood ban is fucking stupid and ONLY based on stigma at this point. All units are tested for dozens of diseases, including HIV1-2.   

It needs to go YESTERDAY.  

The data is settled and we are in **desperate** need of donors country-wide.  

I see his stance is to ""work with the FDA"" which isn't a ""no"", but when other candidates have said flatly ""end it"" this sits in contrast.  

I hope Joe gets some better advice on this specific matter and changes his mind soon."
7322,"Its crazy how easy it is to distort the past to fit a narrative and then have people buy in because it fits their world view.   The busing or crime bill or Clinton's economic policies etc..  These things are far more complex and nuanced.  I remember the big deal about basketball, lol."
7323,How am I trolling? I have posted things on Sanders sub-Reddits of course but I am allowed to do that. I wanted to come here to understand the people from  the other side of the debate better especially since we are supposed to be uniting together.

Obama left a very sour taste in my mouth when he capitulated to McConnell, expecting him to reciprocate, and when he didn't he just kept giving.  I know that's why Amy was a non-starter for me on her platform of No We Can't!

7376,"So, in what ways do you think that Biden would be a better candidate than Clinton? I just worry we're headed to a repeat."
7377,"A lot of critics make that argument. 

[However, look beyond that:](https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/nasa-inventions/nasa-breakthroughs-in-medicine.htm)

&gt;NASA's role in medical breakthroughs is no accident. When Congress established NASA in 1958, it required the space agency to share information about its discoveries. NASA was also given the go-ahead to patent inventions and help businesses develop commercial uses for them.
&gt; 
&gt; Some medical breakthroughs are the result of NASA's partnerships with other researchers. Some came because NASA scientists saw other applications for discoveries they made or technologies they developed while keeping spacecraft flying and astronauts healthy. NASA reports the commercial use of its inventions in its annual ""Spinoff"" reports.
&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes NASA didn't invent the breakthrough, but rather the technologies that led to the breakthrough or improved on them. For instance, NASA didn't invent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), but NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory developed digital image processing to enhance pictures of the moon. That contributed to MRIs and CT or CAT Scans (also known as computerized tomography).
&gt; 
&gt; Another example is the development of the LVAD (Left Ventricular Assist Device) in 1995. Engineers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston worked with Dr. Michael DeBakey to develop this artificial heart pump based on the space shuttle's fuel pumps. It helps keep people healthy as they wait for heart transplants -- and sometimes makes a transplant unnecessary.

7387,Another Yang Gang here! Welcome aboard.
7388,Also like it Warren thought Bernie would make a decent president she probably would have never run. She knows their support overlaps a lot so she hasn't attacked him much but she knows him and his ideas pretty well and does not want him to be President
7389,Yes...huge...
7390,Upvoting&gt;actually voting
7391,Very frustrating being a pro gun liberal but I agree with everything else and thankfully Democrats in rural states like mine are much more pro gun rights

7393,That will be dictated by his health after one.  It is therefore unknown now.
7394,"Look, I just hope he can win. I ain't a Biden supporter by any means but it's clear who the Democratic party wants. So I'll get on board up to and until we can defeat Trump."
7395,Nice
7396,"Sorry, my point was that it was expected that rose twitter is going to keep making insane conspiracy theories!"
7397,"It's not a movie casting or fantasy football draft, you don't just choose the prominent celebs for image reasons."
7398,Would love to ask Ernst and her constituents how well that sham smear campaign of an impeachment is working out now. Her smug comment still infuriates me !
7399,"People can change their minds, if people hadn't, gay marriage would still be illegal. The entire country shifted, and Biden helped that shift, he took the position when it was not popular at the time."
7400,Last week we won South Carolina! What a crazy seven days this has been for the Joe Biden campaign.
7401,"I see, that makes more sense! üôÇ"
7402,got it.   I'm hoping Mayor!
7403,I hope you guys can at least admit that you realize that Biden would be an infinitely better President that trump

7409,"If Biden's the nominee, and it looks like he will be then we've got to vote for the guy. It's him or Trump.

Also, Biden wants to raise the min wage and does, apparently, want to provide free college so there's that."
7410,The Thom Tillis is vulnerable and the democratic challenger is looking strong in the polls against him. It will be a battle though
7411,I was very confused because I thought you all were talking about the 42% in the subject line.

7419,"If Bernie is ‚Äòrequired‚Äô to be held responsible for his supporters being rude online, does that mean Biden needs to be held accountable for his supporter calling a cancer survivor a whore?"
7420,Vote for downballot Democrats at least. If people like you are going to gift Trump another term we need a congress that limits him.

7422,"You can clap an article 50 times on Medium. In case anyone was curious.

7424,Lol. Just gotta find your own echo chamber
7425,"Thanks.

7426,You don‚Äôt see anything wrong with wasting his supporters money opening new offices when he can‚Äôt win? And how will opening new offices help push Biden or the party to the left? Someone who knows they can‚Äôt win stops asking for money and suspends their campaign.
7427,"Who cares?

538 said HRC would win. 

Reading 538 to make us feel better between now and November can only screw us."
7428,"Yea. Usually the rule is this; if the account has &lt;1000 karma, higher chance of a throwaway account troll or bot.

If the the account posts in arh- politics/wayofbern/s4p subs and is supportive of Bernie, it's probably just another Bernie bro.

Even today, I still see Bernie bro trolls in other candidates' subs like Pete, Warren &amp; Yang. Commonly begging for endorsement and shit. Like these people have really nothing better to do.


Bots may be a different story; I remember when arh-politics created a new megathread for Warren dropping out, within 15mins there were more than 1k comments wtf. Where other normal posts there, even the pro-Bernie ones, take at least 30mins or so to even reach &gt;100 comments.

It's insane really, the amount of trolls and potential disinformation bots and accounts throughout these political subs."
7429,Joe Biden cant run a livestream let alone the country. what a shit show.
7430,"Tammy Duckworth?  Though I don't know much about her.

Some are saying Klobuchar but she is like Tim Kaine in the sense that she lacks pzazz ... I think she would make a good leader but I think we need someone with more spice to win"
7431,"Yeah I agree:

1. not all Bernie supporters are BBs 

2. Most of the working class voters are supporting Biden 

3. Biden will make more progressive changes on groung helping those folks (he said in 2019 colbert interview he is most concerned about 4th industrial revolution which will affect working class the worst)

4. Bernie is not the only one who cares about the working class"
7432,It exists.  Quite pretty actually.
7433,Are you projecting on an entire group of people based on what you see on reddit? Don‚Äôt you see how that can be a little short sighted? And doesn‚Äôt he constantly tell people to be civil to each other? Wasn‚Äôt Biden the one insulting people on the campaign trail who disagree with him?
7434,"I am in the same boat! I voted for Bernie in California in the 2016 and 2020 primaries. I am obviously heart broken that Bernie is losing. However, I have read Biden's policies and they are better than Trump's plans obviously and generally they are pretty good and better than what we have now. If Biden is the nominee (all but assured at this point), Joe can count on my vote."
7435,"He‚Äôs not suspending his campaign, the Axios report was false. However, he has suspended Facebook advertising, at least for now. Here‚Äôs another tweet talking about it: https://mobile.twitter.com/aseitzwald/status/1240298441093386243"
7436,Bernies base didn't vote for Bernie.
7437,"When the majority of the state is a moderate Republican, the Democratic base has to be a lot more liberal to distinguish itself tbh."
7438,"I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt think that explaining how much this election means to me and millions of others hurts Joe Biden."
7439,"THANK YOU. As someone who had a stutter as a kid it‚Äôs so infuriating to see uncle Joe being torn apart for a couple incorrect words. Everyone knows what he‚Äôs trying to say. His gaffs are nowhere near Trump‚Äôs Freudian slips, yet it seems like he‚Äôs being criticized just as intensely"

7446,"So you've admitted that Bernie's plan to eliminate private healthcare is not consistent with the systems of other countries and you've admitted that his plan won't pass congress yet you still support it. Bud, sending a message is all good and well but there are people out there who genuinely need healthcare reform now. The fact that you would genuinely ask why you should support a plan that's better than nothing is astounding to me, of course you should support a plan that's better than nothing, because it's better than nothing, it genuinely boggles my mind why Sanders supporters feel sending some sort of message is somehow better than getting actual reform, you need to look at the political reality. If Sanders spends his presidency in political deadlock and eventually loses to a Republican over Medicare for all, healthcare will become a toxic issue in the democratic party, nobody will want to touch it with a 10 foot poll because everyone will know it was the issue that tore down Bernie's presidency, not only are Bernie's proposals useless by your own admission, but they will probably be actively damaging to the cause of better public healthcare in the long run."
7447,"&gt; It will never be recovered

Naw. *Every* primary cycle since creation it's been taken over (or nearly so) by the supporters of one candidate, and then when that candidate loses, the sub gets back to normal quite rapidly.

But yeah, that ""normal"" includes the firm rejection of anything right-leaning."
7448,I don't understand this line of thinking at all. I'm of the younger generation and I will never accept it as ok for other countries to interfere in our elections. This is akin to attacking our country on our own soil and it should be treated as such.
7449,They got away with it in 2016 with Hillary‚Äôs emails and Benghazi nonstop. It‚Äôs time for them to be exposed for the Trump family‚Äôs actual grifting and nepotism not conspiracies.

But it was President George Herbert Walker Bush who almost instantly supported the German chancellor Helmut Kohl in his strive to reunify Germany whilst the leader of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev, the President of France Fran√ßois Mitterrand and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher were not excited about the prospect of a reunified Germany to say the least.

But, on October 3rd, 1990, Germany was reunified finally. 

And so I stand here who, also thanks to President Bush, had the chance to be born and to grow up in a reunified Germany in the heart of Europe."
7453,"Asking for a discussion while saying the candidate sounds dumb isn‚Äôt good faith.

The only way I would have voted for Bernie is if he was the nominee. I‚Äôm not over 50 either.

Yes, we all want Trump out for many, many reasons. We also want a unifier of all people. Bernard simply is not."
7454,"Sorry for the late response! Dealing with the outbreak in OC and it's only getting worse.

There is so much out there that people are unaware of, batteries the size of a radiator that can power a house for a week, I've worked on solar farms and helped engineer new wave generators and those are already phasing out fossil fuels to a point we don't need it anymore, it make so much energy that CA sells it to other states! I've met brilliant young minds with no engineering degrees that have made makeshift solar panels and wind generators. There are so many minds that have ideas for the environment, I don't see how that is not the groundwork for an explosion of new ways to create renewable energy and have people on board as well.

The current carbon tax right now is a blanket term, yes, it compels companies to think about their effects on the environment, however I believe that that's not enough, $80 - $100, hell let's even raise it to $300 a ton, that is nothing to those corporations, since carbon emissions are still on the rise. It's as you said, some are much more concerned with looking concerned than actually accomplishing anything. Ultimately, yeah, everyone supports a carbon tax, but it needs to be changed significantly, since it only solves one of the many other issues, like how the tax affects farmers worse than corporations or that fossil fuel companies are not taken accountable yet for the destruction they have caused, I know Biden has said that he would, but we can only watch if he follows though."
7455,"I don't necessarily dislike Tulsi, but her lack of campaigning while remaining in the race was baffling to me.  But you're right--she and Biden do have similar views!"

Well, that *is* how a democracy works. What is your alternative solution to the popular vote?"
7462,"I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the right attitude to have. Biden has been running a campaign of inclusion, and laughing at people when their candidate underperforms is not inclusive. That‚Äôs not the type of behavior that will win us the general election."

That's why Pete Buttigieg's compassion, civility and intelligence was like a light in the tunnel. Listening to him speak was a pleasure, he's SO good at it. When I saw what the 'progressive' opposition was throwing at him I was beyond disgusted. I was so happy that he won Iowa and am also happy to see he's a true patriot and believes in his message above everything else unlike many others. I think he'll do great things and I'll be watching. I like him so very much!"
7469,But why can‚Äôt I ask the question? Why can‚Äôt I ask people their opinions and ideas about him? Shouldn‚Äôt people be allowed to express their own ideas with each other? Ask each other questions about what they believe and who they support?

7482,"This is my problem with the whole narrative that Bernie is divisive. It's a primary, we *should* see a contrast of ideas and records. These ads are no different than the ones ran about Bernie being divisive, which in turn is divisive to Bernie supporters.

7513,"Range voting is a voting method where voters are essentially asked to score candidate. It's hard to explain how it's better, but this website does a really good job of explaining it, https://rangevoting.org/. Once all the scores are taken, the candidate with the highest average wins. Since there aren't restrictions in how you score candidates, you have a lot more freedom as a voter. I might, for example, give my favorite candidate (or candidates) a perfect score, candidates in the same party a mediocre score, and candidates in the opposing party a low score. With a ranked choice ballot, the divide between how much I like my least favorite Democrat at favorite Republican would be the same as the divide between my first and second choices, even though I probably like all of the Democrats far more than I like the Republicans. The idea is to make as many people as happy as possible, while also avoiding making anyone excessively unhappy.

7522,"Are you fucking kidding me? Warren has absolutely no integrity whatsoever. All of the establishment ghouls have lined up behind Biden and therefore against a serious left-wing agenda, and all Warren can do is bullshit self-indulgent appearances on SNL. Has she endorsed the only progressive candidate left in the race? Has she even spoken out against the candidate who she literally began her career in politics criticizing, who is now supported by the billionaire sexual predator who she just had a 'ebic viral moment' dismantling at the debates? No. Her personal branding is clearly more important to her than actually fighting for these ideas or she would be fighting for and with Sanders tooth and nail."
7523,"Incremental change is nice but Joe Biden has actually done actual harm in the places that he's chosen to compromise and depending on the circumstances could arguably done more harm than good.

Also does a return to business as usual mean going back to legendary Republican obstructionism? Governance by fiat? Prevention of the nomination of any Supreme Court Justices? From what I understand, Joe Biden still believes one an governance through the Senate, even divided ones and if the last decade has taught us anything, that is false and I don't see any evidence that he would be willing to take any action to advance his agenda. I don't know. Going  back to the status quo feels safe, but in a historical sense what was normal during Obama isn't actually normal."

In 2016, my fiercely independent voting parents were nonstop saying ""Can't Biden just run?"" When it was Hillary vs Trump in the beginning of the GE. Hell, there were polls that had him as the favorite candidate WELL into the 2016 primary despite him not even running.

My fiancee's parents are Republicans who didn't vote for the first time since they were 18 because of Trump. They **loathed** Hillary but are jacked up for Biden.

This election is going to be so different than 2016. Russia is going to find it hard to build a destructive narrative when they don't have 30 years of GOP character attacks and misogyny on their side."

I think Warren might prefer a chance of some of her bills passing, if we can get a Senate majority. Hopefully she'd be given a position of leadership there. Or in Biden's cabinet, of course, but her being in the Senate is also important."

I don't know who he's picking so I won't speculate, but I am certain his administration will be the most progressive in history. He only seems like a ""centrist"" in relation to Bernie, he was always a solid liberal, but one who knows how to work with people."

* Make  effective prevention, treatment, and recovery services available to all,  including through a $125 billion federal investment.

7592,"&gt;We ask that you go further: support a ban on professional lobbying by any former president, vice president, cabinet secretary, federal judge, or member of Congress. 

Could take it or leave it tbh. Might be a smart bone to throw.

&gt;We ask also that you make passage of a constitutional amendment to limit campaign contributions ‚Äî nullifying Citizens United ‚Äî a top priority. 

I can't justify making this a top priority, at least in his first term. Healthcare is tearing the party apart and we're running out of time on climate. And constitutional amendments are a bitch and a half to pass.

&gt;We need¬†comprehensive reform of our immigration justice system, and we must start with decriminalizing immigration. To prevent future abuses, we urge you to commit to the establishment of professional, independent Article I immigration courts, and to provide access to counsel in all immigration courts. You have condemned the horrific actions of the Trump administration at the border. We urge you to adopt Senator Warren‚Äôs plan for a Department of Justice task force to investigate and prosecute all reported crimes committed against detained immigrants.

This is all good. I'm worried going all the way to decriminalization is risky in the general but if we're making those kinds of concessions to the left I'd start with that.

&gt;. We are supportive of public service, but strongly believe that across-the-board college loan debt reduction is the best approach, especially for those with increased barriers (poor and working-class students, students with family obligations, and working students).  Senator Warren‚Äôs approach¬†and cancel student loan debt through executive action, immediately enabling 95% of student loan debt holders to pursue their dreams.

my problem with Warren and Sanders's focus on this is that the college educated already have a leg up on a lot of working class people (having graduated) and likely got in bc they got better primary and secondary educations than poorer kids. but Warren's plan is more progressive than Sanders and Biden also has a plan that's pretty close to anything that's pretty close anything that could pass Congress.

&gt;Universal child care is an investment in working parents. It provides millions of children with access to quality care and early learning. It also creates millions of well-paying jobs for child care workers and early education teachers, many of whom are women of color. Senator Warren‚Äôs plan, which mandates that universal child care be free to any family that earns less than 200 percent of the federal poverty line. 

As a pro-life Democrat I support this pretty much uncritically. And I think Biden's plan is basically this but without even the means test.

&gt;We ask that you use Senator Warren‚Äôs plan for¬†Protecting the Rights and Equality of Americans With Disabilities¬†as a model. This includes our ask that you to commit to combating discrimination in the labor market and workplace, ending the subminimum wage, fully funding the Office of Disability Employment Policy, improving SSI and SSDI programs, breaking down barriers to marriage, providing national paid family and medical leave, improving critical elements of the long-term services, and supporting coverage to enable the right to live in the community. We also urge you to protect the civil rights of all Americans with disabilities, including decriminalizing poverty, addressing language deprivation for Deaf and hard-of-hearing students, and enforcing the ADA everywhere that it is applicable. We urge you to work with the disability rights community to incorporate key priorities relating to employment, housing, opioid medications, disaster preparedness, healthcare, education, equity in criminal justice, deinstitutionalization, and other key civil rights issues into your platform.

all good

&gt;We believe ultra-millionaires, who benefit most from our country‚Äôs infrastructure, should invest a little more in our country. Therefore, we ask you to adopt¬†Senator Warren‚Äôs two cent wealth tax, which requires those Americans lucky enough to have vast fortunes to pay a two cent tax on every dollar of net worth above $50 million.¬†

Wealth taxes haven't worked when tried and one would probably require a consritutional amendment. Biden has [other plans for progressive taxation.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/5/20995225/joe-biden-tax-plan)

All in all I think there'll be a lot of overlap to be had when Biden and Warren start working together to pass things."

7594,"&gt; His answer was as good as it could be

Bullshit, it was a garbage-tier whataboutism.

A good answer would have explained why he had held the views he had previously, what specifically made those votes bad, how and why he changed his mind, and what specific action he'd take on the issue in the future.

Trying to segue into some bizarre attack on Biden's trade policy while completely avoiding the actual issue and question being brought up other than waving his hand at everyone and going ""everyone has bad votes back the fuck off of me"" is a trash answer. 

Shit, I know for sure that answer wasn't as good as it could have been because **Sanders himself** gave a better answer when asked that same question in a debate in 2016.

Well there's a bit of rough housing from all aisles but what group say things like 'low information black voters vote for Biden' &amp; 'snake' (Warren), 'ratf***' , 'corporate elites' etc. I don't think there are equivalents to be made between Biden supporters and Sanders supporters (etc) because I see Sanders' online supporters (and himself) as leading the charge in vitriol. Bully the opposition into submission tactics, demean and lie about other candidates because we need a political revolution at all costs. The means justify the ends... Who cares who gets hurt?

It'd be great to come together despite our differences, but it isn't exactly easy when you've been harassed for over a year straight, when people apparently within your own party spread lies about your candidate and use every dirty trick in the book, and continue to do so in the name of pushing Sanders down our throats.

I think we're attaching too much of our and others' identities to politics these days. And I think we assume a lot more partisanship than actually exists in the electorate.

7631,"Just curious, you from the UK?"
7632,"Very well written. 

I think one more relevant point from Bernie's electibilty perspective is his negativity. 

Bernie has always been anti things, fighting against someone or something and playing victim to hide the aggressive taxtics. It is a good campaign tactic (like both Trump and bernie has showed), but it is a terrible way to govern. 

Last 5 years Bernie has spent attacking entire democratic party, it's leaders, its history, agenda, accomplishments, it's donors and he'll it's voters. He has hired people from green party, dsa and other such anti dem minded sources. And they have  built up on bernies anger, hatred and perpetually victim theme, and surely some of their followers are acting on it. 

This approach has been great in building a solid fanbase that donates huge sums of money, irrespective of the primary results or chances of victory. And has also built a huge online and decent offline volunteer army. But the problem is that the approach will fall flat in general elections. 

Bernie will need help of many dem operatives (governors, mayors, state and local leaders) to build his campaign for voter outreach, funding, events and finally voting. How will he, his campaign and his army of fans will suddenly become friendly to the enemy they have been fighting for last 5 years? How will the people who have been attacked and whose groups been attacked be empathetic to bernie and his camp? 

Bernie has not been able to bring Warren in his camp, how would all of dem party will be brought back? 

You can already see this in rachel maddie interview from March 4th, where bernie was trying to lie his way out, by claiming obama is not establishment anymore. Bernie will have to rollback last 5 years, i don't see that happening."

Her time as First Lady was quite horrible to her. She redefined the role for the first time in over 50 years. She was first spouse since Eleanor who wasn‚Äôt fully subordinate to the president. Whenever she spoke off the cuff, people just hated it. So she adopted a quite guarded speech pattern in public. If you see her in private conversations, it‚Äôs not really there. And she was routinely humiliated on the largest stage in the world, culminating in the big one. I think it took a piece of her spirit, and I don‚Äôt know if she ever fully recovered."

Edit: and honestly, totally apart from the politics of it, I think Pete and Biden would just work really well together, and at the end of the day the VP has to be someone capable of having the President's back 100%. He isn't supposed to be picking a VP CANDIDATE, he's supposed to be picking a \*VP\*. They need to be the best at the job, not just the race to get there."

It's important to note that just because someone doesn't tell everything the first time isn't a sign of lying.

However, it's ok to *on a case by case basis* say that the evolution of change doesn't make as much sense as others evolution of a story does. In this case with the types of story changing and the strange comments about Russia I'm inclined to think she had a truly uncomfortable encounter in 1993 (she didn't like her boss putting his hands on her shoulders) and used that for political points, and now is trying to blow it into a false story for more political damage."

2. It would cost us a seat in the Senate, since Massachusetts's governor is a Republican and would thus pick a fellow GOPer to replace liz.

7677,"All of the below by the poster (good voting record, can handle the national press, looks younger (important, because of Biden's age))....no serious skeletons in her closet......and might as well get an actual cop (first female police chief of Orlando) considering Kamala/Amy would be called ""a cop"" anyways. Local papers in FL have been encouraging her to run for Senator or writing Op Eds about how Biden should choose her as the VP, which implies the local press likes her.....unlike Kamala who gets (unfairly and fairly, at times) so much negative press attention. 

And this will sound terrible (I'm a feminist, and i realize this sounds icky)...but her husband would be an asset. He's the Mayor of Orange County in FL, and basically the most powerful local official in all of central Florida and somewhat popular. Add in resettled Puerto Ricans from Maria, voters who had their rights given back after prison, the impact of Corona on Florida, and how close Gillum and Nelson's races were....even if the boost is minimal (home state advantage for VPs is often minimal) it can possibly tip FL blue. 

\*Problem is Deming is nowhere near as experienced as Harris or Klobuchar. Normally, she'd be fine but considering Biden's age and the fact the other VP choices are more experienced....it'd be risky."
7678,"Ugh, it's a good thing there's a flood of emotional support from Bernie Sanders people for Pete's people.

They've called Pete everything but pure Satan and they're kicking Pete supporters around.

I've been looking around the board and it's terrible the way they're acting!

Sorry about that Pete people, Bernie's people are a bit rough."
7679,"I agree with this. I will support Bernie if he wins the nomination, but I think Joe has a better shot of beating Trump. And to me, that is my number one issue."
7680,Why?
7681,"Come on down to Uncle Joe‚Äôs 

No Malarkey Zone!‚Ñ¢

We got:

-$15 minimum wage

-200B investment into renewables and nuclear power

-Decriminalized weed

-A full public option

-100B investment into high speed rail because Amtrak is cool

-A carbon tax

-Universal pre-k, community college and trade school

-publicly funded elections (one of my favorites) 

And all of this without increasing the deficit!

-a record of being an effective legislator, passing stuff like the violence against women act, the Brady Bill and spearheading the withdrawal from Iraq and implementation of Obamacare

-a guy who may not be up to date on the latest PC terms but is driven by the mindset the all people are deserving of dignity and respect.

-a guy who has been through the wringer and grew up working class, a man who‚Äôs defining characteristic is empathy.

Pete was my first choice and I‚Äôm a bit left of Biden but Joe is a moral man, and I think that counts for a lot.

Joe would need to hire younger staff who are more adept with social media and what's ""in"", just like what Bernard is doing.

This is coming from a younger millennial. That is how you win them over, not only with policy, with the allure of peer acceptance.

Not sure what the effect of Covid-19 is going to be but I want to think that it's going to be a small but net positive for Joe. I am honestly rooting for the President to pull through at this juncture given how critical the situation is but he hasn't failed to disappoint me thus far."

This disregards the fact that you need to mine rare earths and other materials for solar power and not to mention the materials you need for windmills.

7712,Yeah given how the debates weren‚Äôt the best to show off Pete‚Äôs abilities I‚Äôm willing to open my mind that that is true for other candidates as well.

In that case I've got bad news about literally every other country on the planet. Worst case scenario we get 8 years of a grifter whose rule is marked by such incompetence that a Democratic candidate is practically guaranteed to win in 2024, assuming that Biden somehow loses. We haven't even had a debate, yet. We haven't even gotten out of the primaries yet. Once Biden sets his sights against Trump, we can expect that he will do at least as well as Clinton, but without fatal weaknesses in the rust belt."

Kamala never showed she could win white voters. So black voters stayed with the person they trusted and liked already and who they knew white voters were fine with - Joe Biden.

My guess would be that black voters would be quite happy with Harris on the ticket though I'd love to see some polling. Lower black voter turnout in 2016 was one reason Hillary lost Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania."

7747,"\&gt;  People who are pro M4A are insistent that the only way to get every american covered is with M4A. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think everyone insists can't get covered that way, certainly the public option could accomplish coverage. The  insist is more likely that we can't cover everyone with the public option in an affordable way. The ACA was great in getting people coverage but it did very little to resolve the structural issues that lead to the US paying 2x what other countries are paying for healthcare. Hopefully, the public option could help lower prices with competition but what is the real end game of the public option? To have everyone on it I would hope, which is what M4A wants to do faster. To think that Private health insurance wouldn't fight tooth and nail to prevent the option and if it's going to pass, make sure it's destined for financial failure would be naive. At the end of the day, keeping private insurance in the game with half measures, who's motives are to test and and image as much as possible (more Testing = more money), while providing as little coverage as possible is not going to solve the financial issues of healthcare."

7794,"This debate is important in the sense that we're gonna find out if Biden can handle Trump in a debate. As it stands right now Trump just has to say ""You voted for NAFTA"" and he'll win 40 states in November"
7795,"""This process is very important for voters to make their voices heard and see what the direction of the party is."" - Yang in February

I respect holding onto an endorsement and releasing it mid-momentum, after more folks had the chance to make their voice heard. He did the math!

Serious question though, how did his supporters break after he suspended his campaign? I felt they skewed more Bernie?"
7796,"It‚Äôs like looking up a restaurant on your phone. You can go with the chains that always offer good quality and are less expensive, or you can go with the high end place, costing tons of money and you get less food and it takes a long time and nobody ends up liking it there"
7797,"Oh for sure. I agree that most (although he holds some ideas on nationalization that i think are arguably ""radical"") of his economic policies are mainstream in large swaths of Europe. 

*I actually think Bernie is a strange mix of everything from far left to downright centrist ideas when you look at his history and platform."
7798,"With some of my wildly uninformed family members who back trump, I remind him that hunter Biden is a grown ass man who does what he will, and joe is not responsible for any of it. And that joe also has said openly that he knows it doesn't look great, but it's not a big deal."
7799,Tribalism at its best. If you read the quote in the article from the **Republican!!** then I‚Äôm sure we all agree with him in the need to defeat Trump. He‚Äôs an ally for Joe this election
7800,"Thank you Mayor Pete for your unwavering support for decency, respect,  and honesty. You Mayor Pete are a fine example of someone that is the embodiment of what it means to be a Democrat.  From your Rules of the Road to your decision to suspend your campaign, you did it all with the American people in mind.  Thank you! 

For all the supporters of Mayor Pete that are just lurking or joining us,  welcome! Mayor Pete and Vice President Biden share the same values and vision that brought us here today.  Please feel welcome to post, comment, or just lurk."
7801,"They‚Äôre saying more than 2 million votes were cast before Pete and Amy dropped out.  Votes for them are worthless.

7803,"I really appreciate that passion.  But when it manifests as lying and tearing the party apart I think it is more destructive than helpful.  You can criticize Biden without misrepresenting his positions, being ableist about his stutter, or claiming he is in cognitive decline.

The smears from Bernie's campaign and his online supporters have been beyond the pale.  I saw a meme this morning *questioning if Biden's family members had died in the car accident that took their lives*.

If this is your idea of passion, then I don't want any part of it.  And I think it's a big reason even progressive voters like myself are turned off by Bernie.  And a big reason he is in all likelihood not going to be the nominee."

1. Pete‚Äôs already been vetted and can handle the press
2. Pete campaigns like a rockstar
3. He can deliver Midwest and swing states
4. He can deliver conservative voters
5. Youth
6. Women will have a significant place at the table based on his record
7. Being gay would make it enormously historic
8. Ideal bromance
9. Pete could be Joe‚Äôs last great contribution to American politics
10. Pete is ready to step into the presidency if needed"
7820,"I'd say with his multiple exposures, Trump is infected. Maybe his anti-science, ""I don''t need to learn anything I'm naturally talented"" attitude may end up ending his presidency early."
7821,"‚ÄúPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE vote straight Democratic.‚Äù

Jesus, wtf is wrong with you people?   How about Voting for the most qualified candidate no matter political party."
7822,"At least 2 of his campaign‚Äôs senior staffers voted and campaigned for Jill Stein after Clinton got the Democratic nomination in 2016.

They are still campaigning on messages that damage Biden. That is extremely irresponsible at this point. And it‚Äôs going to make it even more difficult to persuade younger voters and more hardcore supporters to rally behind Biden if/when he is the nominee.

Biden already pulled his policies leftward when he announced his platform months ago. He‚Äôs still tacking leftward with new policy announcements. Bernie has not let up on his rhetoric, however.

In fact, Bernie‚Äôs campaign rhetoric is now trying to PUNISH Biden for moving to the left as either ‚Äústealing‚Äù Bernie‚Äôs policies or ‚Äúpandering‚Äù to Bernie‚Äôs base.

That is unforgivable. Bernie needs to either change his campaign strategy radically or he will become an increasing danger to the future of this democracy."

7825,"If he actually cared about the party or defeating trump he would drop out right now. I know we are all telling ourselves that the race is not over yet, but super Tuesday was supposed to be the day that sanders built a delegate lead to cover for the losses he was gonna face afterwards and he got walloped, and that was all before Bloomberg dropped out. And I also won‚Äôt be too surprised if warren and her supporters mostly go to Biden. This thing is over."
7826,"This is why Biden is so good. He adopted stuff from the campaigns that he has beaten, from Pete to Bernie. 

Bernie doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs his way or the high way and that‚Äôs why he gets stomped. 

I‚Äôm super excited that Biden has stomped Bernie so hard. 

I‚Äôm planning on voting buttigieg now given that Bernie will probably be mathematically eliminated by the time that my state comes around to vote. 

If he loses to a guy who has already dropped, maybe he will get the message and not bother in 2024."

7832,"&gt;Because he has NO chance to win. His campaign is dead. Everyone else knows that. 

And that's *forcing people to vote* how?

&gt;He is forcing the Democratic Party to keep holding primaries and let people get infected because they are legally bound to hold primaries until there is only one candidate.

Still, nobody *has to vote* if they don't want to. Just admit you were speaking off the cuff and weren't being literal."
7833,"The win comes at a crucial time for the Biden campaign. After coming in fourth in Iowa, fifth in New Hampshire and a distant second in Nevada, he reportedly saw South Carolina as the last chance to inject some energy into his campaign.

7835,"Amtrak is owned by the government, but the tracks they run on aren't.  The tracks (the physical rails on the ground) are owned by private companies that will priorities freight over Amtrak trains causing massive delays.  This is the core of why the American passenger network is not good.

Nottingham has a population of around 750,000 cause the city of ""Nottingham"" doesn't include the suburbs.

The UK is closer, which means high speed rail is less efficient than in the US.  http://www.ushsr.com/benefits/timesavings.html  Here is a link to see the huge time savings when going on long distance travel.  The reason for high speed rail is for longer Journeys, stuff like the 200 miles London to Manchester rail.  It is more efficient and faster than planes or cars.

Rail in the UK moves large amounts of people between a large amount of different locations and every town has rail.  If we look at your example, the US needs rail more than the UK does.  Oklahoma City is the same distance as Manchester is to London and takes a 3 hour drive but could take a 1 hour 10 minute train journey.  That cuts 3 hours and 40 minutes off of the round trip.  Many parts of the US are perfect for high speed rail with the great planes being flatter than a pancake.

Rail works well moving any amount of people any distance cause if the government can't fill passenger trains they can always just give out contracts to freight trains to run regular freight services instead.  If you build the rails people will use them cause they are cheaper and quicker for long distance journeys than cars and planes.  It's also basically impossible to go to net zero emmissions without building them as they get rid of planes for most journeys."

7841,"As others have said - it's not a 27 point lead, it's a 47 point lead according to this poll. Delete this post and repost with a new title."
7842,I'm on the same boat in terms of why I primarly support Joe - that being foreign policy. Alongside his commitment to NATO he seems to have a much clearer stance on the Pacific and America's asian allies as well. That and the fact he acknowledged the importance of cyber warfare in the modern era and wants America to focus on that rather than 'traditional warfare' in terms of assessing security risks.
7843,"Last night I got a text message that my vote by mail ballot was finally received.

Trump is a national embarrassment. We have had republican presidents in the past who didn‚Äôt burn it all to the ground. Yes, they made policy choices that I didn‚Äôt agree with, but they were much better suited to represent our country than this man. 

Conservatives are always going to want to cut taxes, and reduce federal involvement...that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre all horrible people. I‚Äôve also lived through 3 republican presidencies and abortion has never been threatened in such an extreme manner until very recently...that‚Äôs the influence of the right wing evangelicals.

I‚Äôm aware people didn‚Äôt like Hillary. But the fact that she bested both of her opponents by 7 million votes isn‚Äôt the best talking point to support that argument."
7910,"Hillary lost due to the 20+ years of shitslinging from GOP...which got further fueled by Bernie's 1 year of populist shitslinging that tarnished her reputation and public image prior to GE.

I think that's the biggest reason of all."

I get the logistical nightmare it would be to set up a system like this so quickly, but that's REALLY going to dampen turnout. Just having the extra step of needing to go out of your way to request a mail-in ballot, as opposed to just sending the ballot to every registered voter automatically, makes voting less accessible, and people who are on the fence about voting at all are surely going to be disincentivized by this."

7930,"I‚Äôm a Bernie supporter and here is my take. Joe Biden is a good guy. It‚Äôs just that he‚Äôs not very good at being a good guy. It‚Äôs obvious that he means well but it‚Äôs rough around the edges. 

If he is the nominee then of course I will vote for him. I‚Äôm glad he released a statement and I hope he continues to push for a better deal. We need each other as Americans now more than ever."

Also, the role of any good president is choosing who to empower and trust. When Obama took office, he didn't have any shared experiences with the people who end up working for him. Joe's in a much better position. He already knows the strengths and weaknesses of the people he's likely to call upon, as he had 8 years to get to know them, and see what worked and what didn't.

Considering the situation the country is in, there is absolutely no need to drag this out, all of us needs to be focused on the pandemic, Bernie as well.
It wasnt about Bernie himself for me, im in it for the policies that Bernie advocated for, that will not change, but i guess i`ll have to put Bernie ignore from now on, there are more important things to deal with than a dead primary."

7980,Good lord no thank you. Maybe give her AG at most. She still put innocent black men in jail for nonviolent drug crimes and then was incredibly flip about her own drug use.

But I'd say it's more likely that Bernie has come to terms with the fact that he won't win the nomination, and he is now shifting his strategy toward trying to pressure Biden to come closer to Bernie's progressive agenda, rather than attacking him to try to get the nomination for himself. And he telegraphed the questions to suggest that these are the areas in which he is proposing Biden come closer to the Bernie agenda, in order to get Bernie out of his way / earn his immediate support.

Basically saying he's not going to just roll over and do the unifying of the party himself. He wants Joe to meet him part of the way. Bernie's agenda is extremely important to him and he knows he has leverage."

7996,"Seriously. 

I've supported Bernie since 2016.  You know where I learned about things like CTH?  *Other campaigns' subs*.  I was disgusted by the sub because that isn't representative of what Bernie stands for. 

I get that it is advantageous to your #1 if you paint the entirety of Sanders' campaign as a bunch of internet trolls but it just simply isn't true.  There is a reason it is a different sub- because that shit doesn't fly on S4P.  This is a manipulation game and it's been drilled out in ridiculous levels since Pete announced pulling from the race. 

Biden is my number two,  but that doesn't mean we're not all on the same team.   Politics has polarized and people equate it to sports fandom.  You'll find that in any camp,  and people who are polarizing should be condemned- in any camp. 

Any other year we'd be ignoring the trolls or blocking them.   For some reason now it seems appropriate to say they represent the whole of a campaign, which also alienates a *lot* of reasonable people. 

I'm reporting or engaging any pro- Sanders troll wherever I see it and they're getting deleted or removed swiftly.  I urge you to do so as well instead of giving them a voice."
7997,"I‚Äôm going to keep reading up on Joe and his ideas in case he ends up the nominee. I‚Äôd like to be armed with enough facts to try to get people to vote for him. I‚Äôve been really paying attention to Bernie since Hillary lost and feel really passionate about his ideas. The system isn‚Äôt working for most of us and needs a serious rebuild.  I think Sanders would‚Äôve beat Trump last time.  I think he‚Äôd beat him this time. Let‚Äôs hope Biden can if he wins the nomination.  Another four years of Trump would be unbearable. 

I think you‚Äôre right about Bernie pushing the party towards his ideas even if he doesn‚Äôt get the nod. His influence will be felt in the years to come. 

I also feel that Bloomberg‚Äôs campaign was less about winning and more about making sure Bernie didn‚Äôt but that‚Äôs another discussion for another time lol"
7998,"&gt;Judging from what I know it seems Biden felt partially obligated to run because of 2016 guilt.

8000,This is good and I agree 100% but what are you doing to support Joe? Joe needs your support and doing this isnt enough you need to support him.
8001,"I like your comment because we need to not get stuck on what the general publics impression would be the moment they saw the headline ""Biden picks Warren as VP"" but instead try to game out what the attacks will be and whether they are likely to stick.

You hope with a VP that they address any gap the POTUS candidate has with the *General* electorate rather than Actually opening up new critiques. I suspect Warren is the latter category despite the fact I like her"
8002,That's what I want to know as well. I keep hearing this as a main point for picking Harris but she really didn't rally AAs during her own campaign. Plus it's kind of a moot point since it appears that Biden has the AA vote almost completely locked down.
8003,Why isn‚Äôt joe a good candidate?
8004,No it isn't. It feels like you don't know the history nuclear power in America.
8005,r/politics took down the megathread already. Wow.

I have been ceaselessly attacked for supporting my candidate, and while every other candidate's campaign is offering Pete's supporters space, Bernie's supporters are publicly advocating for people to delete their ""rat emojis"", search for upset fans and poach them.

When Bernie does something to reign in his fanbase, I'll consider. But until then, their hostility will cost them my vote."

*  Provide Section 8 housing vouchers to every eligible family so that no one has to pay more than 30% of their income for rental housing
* Establish a $100 billion Affordable Housing Fund to construct and upgrade affordable housing.
* Eliminate local and state housing regulations that limit affordable housing options and contribute to urban sprawl. 
* Ensure minority-owned businesses benefit from investment in housing construction and repair.

I‚Äôm okay with codetermination (or rather, can accept it, even if it‚Äôs not my preferred system).. Sander‚Äôs plan allows for companies to be shut down by the executive, though, if they ‚Äúharm the community or employees‚Äù."

8062,"Really?


I liked the idea of Biden being the great unifier. I don't like him or his past or his policies, but I liked the fact that his community here on Reddit was pretty chill and open to having civil discussions instead of this blind, ""everyone who doesn't tow the line is a MAGA"" that seems to have taken over it recently.


If Biden and his campaign aren't interested in addressing topics that matter to me, I'm not interested in voting for him. 


I'm done. See y'all in 2024, I'm hoping we can try to work together then."
8063,This assumes the guy you're selling to doesn't already dislike you. Or that you're known for eventually compromising. Neither describes Bernie's time in Washington.
8064,"An annoying thing about the crime bill attacks is Sanders supported the bill, said it was a good compromise bill and voted for it."
8065,"My favorite SNL cold open is still the Tina Fey/Amy Poehler announcement about sexism in the campaign.  Right up there with grim reaper Steve Bannon and Jeff Sessions on the mantle.  Oh, and Omarosa pounding on the windows.  Man, there have been some good ones these last four years."
8066,"Go to JoeBiden.Com, click on action center, and scroll down."
8067,BidenEdgeEdge. Love it. Who‚Äôs making the t-shirts?
8068,Yes!
8069,"I think if Joe does well (and I'm pretty optimistic he'll exceed expectations) in debate then sweeps Tuesday, I think everyone will try to get Bernie to quit. Biden's campaign will ignore him and pivot to Trump. Endorsements from Warren, Pelosi, and maybe Obama will be coming.

I'm really hoping Sanders will be a team player. He seems more subdued this time. Joe should make some concessions to rally the left (as he did with Warren) and get ready for the general."
8070,"I know it‚Äôs a long shot, but I really, really hope we can distance ourselves from this kind of hatred this cycle. 

I don‚Äôt think Sanders is an egomaniac. I think he has integrity and is intensely passionate, and much like with his supporters that passion often manifests itself in a misguided way‚Äîbut that‚Äôs very, very different from being a straight egomaniac."
8071,"I agree with you, especially on the Fox News bit. We need to reach out to the people that only watch Fox, if for no other reason to show face and say we care about all Americans, whether you vote for us or not. Spread the platform through whatever means you can."
8072,"I'm not sure if that's true. I'm having trouble finding loan debt data compared against income but this [article](https://www.fool.com/student-loans/student-loan-debt-statistics/) makes the point that black graduates have on average $7400 more in loan debt than white peers, and poverty disproportionately effects black people. I would really like to see data on loan debt vs. income, but my hunch is that lower income people will have worse debt burdens. So I don't think it's correct to say it's regressive."
8073,"I agree it should happen, but I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily rush it. Sounds like a gold mine for hackers to mess with"
8074,"Also I can say as someone who's airways were blanketed with Bloomberg ads for a good month before the Super Tuesday vote, Bloomberg hired a really good ad team."
8075,Interesting cuz it seems like Sanders has done very well with that community out west.
8076,"Klo and Harris are such fucking Tim Kaines. who is really gona say ""oh man Biden was such a no for me until he brought on Harris.""? actually let me answer that, maybe like... a high school art teacher in Reno Nevada. Warren or Abrams please."
8077,"I would love to have a new system that involves no drop outs, ranked voting, simultaneous voting across states."
8078,He fundraises way better and is a better campaigner.
8079,"He just won Utah. Also, he‚Äôs won over states with higher educated voters and there are a lot of states left to go. Additionally he‚Äôs using this time to focus on the Covid-19 response and raise money to support people in need. I don‚Äôt expect Bernie to drop out period. People act like his base won‚Äôt get behind the winner. How about this, you keep it fair until the end and we‚Äôll go with whoever wins."
8080,Calm down. He needs his magic wand AR-15 penis extender to make him feel safe!
8081,"Anyone else frustrated to hear lamentations that we are down to two men in their late 70s from people they know who will then in the next breath say they didn‚Äôt like anyone this cycle? Like really, we had what, over 25 people run and you didn‚Äôt like ANY of them? We had young to old, male and female, moderate to democratic socialist, coastal to midwestern, gay and straight, black, white, Asian, middle class people and billionaires, newcomers and and political veterans you didn‚Äôt like a SINGLE person?!?!? Sorry but that‚Äôs malarkey and I just don‚Äôt believe that."
8082,"I don't think it should be a mob mentality either. In a scenario where you dislike both candidates, my belief is more that it's still important to vote for whoever you believe to be the lesser of two evils, even if you don't support everything single they stand for. Neither Biden or Bernie were my first choice but I would feel better voting for whoever gets the nomination because I believe either would be more beneficial in office than trump.

Based on your comments, you probably don't agree and that's fine! It's your right to choose to sit out."
8083,"You do realize that the current president had never held political office, right?"
8084,To call this early only means great things.
8085,"The problem with the notion of fiscal conservatism and Bernie's (what ever it is) is they are both out dated.  Many of these terms and ideas were developed in the early 70's when the worlds economies where faltering from over regulation after WW2.  Today we have a really solid idea what actually works with tax and regulation models.  MN does just about the best job.  Not to little and not to much. Lots of public private partnerships.  After the crash MN and WI both had new Gov.  WI a republican and MN a DFLer.  Similar economies.  MN raised taxes on the top earners and WI cut them. MN is in much better shape.  If you are interested just google MN and WI. There has been a lot written about this because they are like twins.   Good Luck and make sure to vote!

8086,"Remind them if they care about woman's right, they need to man/woman up and vote for joe. The supreme court is like 3-6 liberal-conservative ruth bader ginsburg is currently 86 and trying to hold on for the next dem. Trump will pack all the courts with 50 year olds and that will be that for the next 40 years."
8087,"The ones on my Facebook timeline have been saying for months that Pete is just a pro-Joe DNC plant, so yeah. I'm sure they're fastening their tin foil hats right now."
8088,The election seems drowned out with all the corona virus stuff
8089,Do you have anything to add about Sanders dropping out so as to avoid another heart attack?
8090,I mean the math for either of them to win is astronomical
8091,"Just skip it, Joe. You've got more important things to do."
8092,Sanders has no chance in FL - he has said nice things about Cuba and Fidel
8093,"Ok, but just vote biden ok"
8094,"Honestly, it‚Äôs Bernie bros speaking to other Bernie bros. It‚Äôs not going to influence anything of real significance and if it does it just lowers the bar for him at debates, making it easier for him to clear. Debates where people exceed expectations tend to give boosts so let some doubt and it will help him. This race is over. Biden is the winner and will defeat Don the Dictator."
8095,"Warren shot up in my rankings when she detailed her transition plan towards Medicare for All, to include a public option bill.  The reaction of many Bernie supporters, to call her a traitor for acknowledging that immediately passing m4a was impossible, is.... telling

That‚Äôs where I want to end up, too.  But I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs possible without an intermediate step.  And they don‚Äôt seem to... care?"
8096,"Love Pete so much! He has about 40 more years to run, and will be huge in the 2030s."
8097,"Lol.

Regardless it doesn't matter: ND has only a puny 14 delegates. So delegate math means Bernie gets 8 delegates, Biden gets 6.

So ND only let Bernie have an extra 2 delegates lead over Biden. Lol."
8098,9000 members!
8099,I'm not voting for joe either but because he's a sexual predator not that
8100,"I did not confuse Marxism with healthcare - you‚Äôre doing that.

I specifically said we don‚Äôt need a Marxist to have healthcare. Democrats can get healthcare done without Marxism. 

Bernie isn‚Äôt a democrat, he nationalizes major industries and seizes the assets of Americans.

We can get healthcare without Bernie and without having our industries seized."
8101,Kamala
8102,Hey girl! Team Pete transfer to the Biden bus. Gay male millennial here.
8103,Did you mean his own Twitter? Because I was under the impression that this is the main Biden sub Reddit.
8104,Why is this reported?
8105,I'm just ready to turn the left's collective anger towards those who deserve it instead of each other.
8106,"Trump is so volatile and uses all sorts of corrupt and deceptive tactics it's tricky to weigh up whether he will play himself or benefit himself by going low as possible. 

Joe has a better chance than most."
8107,This is one time when the /s tag is truly needed - this could easily pass for an actual poster on this sub.
8108,The cleaning crew...lol
8109,"&gt; With her birth in Thailand is Duckworth able to become president? 

Yes, [Tammy Duckworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth#Early_life_and_education) is a natural born citizen despite having been born in Thailand because her father was a U.S. Citizen."
8110,"holy shit, I've seen probably more than 5 endorsements today. Keep em coming!!"
8111,Good for Biden!
8112,Cool!
8113,"I mean he‚Äôs pretty moderate on stuff like abortion and is a faithful catholic so probably. He doesn‚Äôt have a soft spot for socialism so we‚Äôll probably  get Florida, if you look at the polls, people like a public option more than M4A. Basically a Biden administration would be the Obama administration unleashed, the party has moved to the left so all of Barack and Joes wildest dreams can be realized."
8114,So we know they're thinking for themselves and not just reading a heavily prepared teleprompter?
8115,"Who said he didn't win a primary since ST? He won North Dakota. Problem is, he is winning these meaningless delegate counts when he needs 300+ just to break even."
8116,Not by the MSM
8117,welcome aboard!
8118,He stopped shaking hands with supporters after rallies due to concerns of coronavirus
8119,Lol how?
8120,I don‚Äôt think it will.
8121,Joe Biden says that water is wet.
8122,He was able to get an admission out of Joe though. He did have to do some maneuvering though.
8123,"There's still down-ballot votes that need to happen. People should still have the right to voice who they want. Why drop out and deprive them of that? Why take away the enthusiasm to vote in the down ballot races? As long as it can be done safely with mail-in ballots. We need to trial run such a system in all the States right now, this primary is an option to do that.

Check Bernie's Twitter. His campaign has ended talking about Joe Biden. It's all about how Bernie believes the crisis should be addressed now. Why should he end that?

I've supported Tulsi, and I think he her campaign also switched gears but the support around her turned sour and she wasn't able to turn them.

From my point of view, the best way to get  Bernie's supporters to vote in the general election is by letting the campaign continue, and letting his supporters feel like their voices are being counted."
8124,Oh the navy guy?
8125,"So serious question to u/PU18 and u/DictaSupreme

What's the deal with the ROTR regarding Trump himself?  No question we follow it for his supporters (as well as Bernies) but...trump. dude doesnt deserve it. Ill follow what you guys say but hes the big bad. He is the enemy. Do they apply? If so, how do we deal with that? Help!"
8126,"If you're not a fan of a ""my way or the highway"" approach or any inappropriateness re: women, it's hard to see how you'd support Bernie, honestly. I mean no disrespect but these points do not set Bernie and Biden apart in any significant way.

I don't hold either candidate's behavior/personalities in these regards as appealing or disqualifying personally. As I said Biden is not my first pick/dream candidate so you'll have to look elsewhere for someone to defend him as a perfect, flawless candidate.

But between Biden, Bernie and not voting/voting for Trump I'll take Biden all day every day. Regardless of how I feel about it Biden has The People behind him as we've seen through voting and endorsements and he's currently our best chance to bring Democrats together to make Trump a one-term president. And that's the only way it will happen‚Äîif we come together in a united front. It's up to us. If Bernie had the numbers and was stronger in uniting the country I'd have voted for him.

If I can't have Trump's defeat AND the most personal political preferences represented in the nominee, give me Trump's defeat. A vote for preferences over his defeat may just give us neither."
8127,"The USSS‚Äô main job is investigating bank fraud. That‚Äôs what most agents focus on, not personal protection. 

Presidents, former first families, and candidates are assigned a few agents who do specialize in personal protection. 

When campaigns happen they pull local agents to fill out their ranks and those guys hate it because they still have all of their regular investigative work to complete."
8128,I think Yang is going to figure very prominently in American politics for years to come. He really impressed me.
8129,I forgot he had dementia and changed his weed policy 3 times and his son got kicked out the military for a cocaine addiction
8130,Stop supporting Trump.
8131,1000% agree with this
8132,Yup. These types of people don't really care about the policies from politics. They only care about being morally better than other people.
8133,Bernie Sanders wins Reddit and Loses Reality
8134,"Realclearpolitics: Trump: 47.8, Biden: 45.2"
8135,"This shouldn't excuse Rosen's poor handling of the discussion on CNN and poor choice of words in her apology though. Bernie has already called on Joe to respond and I'm quite certain it will come up in the debate on 3/15.

I'm not particularly a fan of Nina Turner in her role on Bernie's campaign, most recently calling out candidates for using Obama as a ""prop"" while Bernie himself runs a misleading ad showcasing a bunch of cherry picked Obama quotes... But it seems pretty clear (to me at least) that she had this MLK quote correct here. If there's discussion to be had around interpretation it could have been done without minimizing her position in that discussion.

We can call out the anger and negativity flowing from Bernie's campaign towards the other candidates and their supporters. We can also call out when someone on Joe's team makes a mistake. Brushing it aside just gives ammo to trolls."
8136,"Instead of deflecting, can you answer my question?"
8137,Those are MAGAts
8138,It's gonna be tough to choose. Hate to bring it up but there would be a big chance the VP could be president. So the pick has to settle the nerves.
8139,She and jill are not to be messed with.
8140,This looks like propaganda.
8141,"if he could wipe out all the Bros talk of ""WE JUST NEED TO MAKE IT TO A 1V1 DEBATE AND THEN HIS \~DEMENTIA\~ WILL GUARANTEE SANDERS WINS"" i'll call it a day tbh"
8142,What is Biden's policy towards trade with China?
8143,"Im sure they'll just find a new puppet to replace him. Another puppet who will push for all the exact same policies and tell all the same lies, and give the rich all the same tax cuts. Beneath all the rhetoric, republicans are all the same."
8144,"This is going to hurt Bernie.  It reveals them as devious liars, and people are already very skeptical of them."
8145,You can click the source link on [FiveThirtyEight.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/arizona/)
8146,"He was holding off on confirming that, cause Biden was strongly hinting to Yang that he would be VP. We‚Äôve known that for months and a lot of the Yang Gang took a gamble and started supporting Biden after Yang dropped."
8147,The absolute sweet irony in the fact that your comment got removed... It‚Äôs almost a joke at this point
8148,Bernie‚Äôs gotten more done for working americans in two weeks than donald or biden has done in two years. Look at the bad stuff biden‚Äôs done and ask if that‚Äôs the guy i want representing america.
8149,"I love it. But I really, really want her as AG. So much ass-kicking to be done."
8150,Why Joe Biden should pick illinus‚Äô mom for his running mate
8151,"Liz was my first choice after Pete dropped out, who was my first choice after Yang dropped out, who was my first choice after Cory dropped out. Now I'm left with Joe, the only option. 

I value critical thinking skills over ideology. I didn't agree with Warren on everything, but I respected her thought process and due diligence in forming her opinions and policy. She is  goal-oriented, as she wants to get things done to help people. Bernie doesn't have those skills. He seems to follow whatever the banal new-age, anti-capitalist stance is for the sake of ideological purity, especially on science issues, whether they're right or wrong. I could not picture Warren letting Marianne Williamson serve as her surrogate to talk about health issues."
8152,"Is it possible to get a ""Howard Dean For Joe"" flair? He was my first candidate."
8153,A true leader? Say that five times fast.
8154,[Guess what ? ](https://i.imgur.com/CfqXlEE.jpg)
8155,LOL
8156,I think she's definitely taking something from Sanders people considering her stances on M4A and foreign policy
8157,"I agree with you that Trump is a symptom and McConnell et al are essentially using him as a disposable means to their end that hasn't outlived his usefulness so they're going even further than just putting up with a lot and are now actually complicit in his misdeeds. I don't necessarily have faith that they will have an epiphany when ""the adults"" come back. I was a Pete supporter however and if he's all in on supporting Biden's efforts, I believe in Pete's ability to mobilize the public to support down ballot races. He's shown (at least anecdotally from all the future former Republicans I hear from) that he can tap into the American majority that crosses political divides.

Single payer healthcare is the goal, no system is absolutely perfect and the opposition is actively trying to sow divide by publicizing the shortfalls of a single payer system. Some of the news articles that have a more obvious agenda point out extended wait times for specialty care or surgeries, and the lower perceived quality of the care when it's government run. A local news story in my area shows a clip of a man who I think used to report for the CBC saying ""people are dying on waiting lists"" obviously to incite an emotional response. I think an expansion of medicare is a necessary middle step. If medicare for all is the only game in town your criticisms could fall on deaf ears because you don't have alternatives. In the interim expanding medicare would force the public option to provide service equal to or better than what is privately offered. It would also force the private insurance companies to lower costs, and improve service to maintain enrollment. My hope and my expectation is since the private insurance companies still have to answer to shareholders and profit, they just won't be able to compete. Their employees will have an opportunity to transfer to the public option as it grows and the private options recede. In the end we'll have a strong public single payer option that has been tested against the marketplace, and some small private insurers for those who are willing to pay extra for whatever ""products"" or ""conveniences"" the private insurer provides."
8158,"Or any of this, even.

8159,"I think it's also important to note that Reddit and Twitter are their own bubbles. If you spend your time on those two platforms, you'd think that Bernie supporters won't support Biden. But it's clear from 2016 and most people I talk too that most bernie do support Biden, it's just that the Busters are the loud minority"
8160,"I‚Äôll be voting for bernie in ny cause I want the party to go more to the left and I want bernie to have a voice at the convention but yes this. Bernie got a fair shake this time and as much as it hurts he has a glass ceiling where it matters until youth and Reddit political scientists show up to the polls. 
   
   
Whoever has the most delegates and votes should get the nomination. Bernie supporters like me should have a decent voice at the table though when it comes to the party platform because bernie has shown for 2 election cycles now that  a sizable party of the Democratic Party wants a modern day continuation of FDR‚Äôs policies"
8161,He didn‚Äôt lose because of the forced buybacks. He was already on the way down
8162,Do I smell a Bernie brother?
8163,"This actually may not be as settled as one might think. It depends on how you read the Constitution. Obama isn‚Äôt eligible to be *elected* President, so the question is whether he could become President without being *elected*, such as through succession or as VP."
8164,"Everything I've read is that they are filing in the morning, the day of the election. It's up to the courts."
8165,"You don't need me to tell you all of Joe Biden's positions, look them up.  Read them for yourself and make a decision.  You need to weigh the differences between Biden and Trump and decide which one of those two candidates aligns with you the most.  Compromising is not a weakness.  It's a strength.  Best of luck!"
8166,Tulsi Gabbard? Oh please no.
8167,Nice!
8168,"Guys, Biden and Bernie don't write this stuff. They have staffers. And even if they wrote the tweets themselves, this is kind of a silly thing to be critical about. They are both showing respect."
8169,"It's projected to save in the long run, but that's mostly a cost savings on consumers.  That's not the same thing as the cost of implementation.  And there is no clear plan to pay for it."
8170,Nail on the head. He would make an amazing international diplomat.
8171,"Yep - I posted this in r/Pete_Buttigieg too.

The constant asking for $20 (probably 5-10 times each day between texts and emails) is really a turnoff. 

Joe, you‚Äôve got me. You‚Äôve got my vote man. You‚Äôve got my money, too... I just don‚Äôt have *that* much of it. 

I‚Äôm much more likely to donate $3 ten times than $25 once. Micropayments are a thing for a reason and it‚Äôs not a coincidence that charities always say ‚ÄúFor the price of a cup of coffee a day, you can help _____.‚Äù"

8175,"2020 will be my first election; however, I campaigned my ass of in 2018 to unseat the incumbent Republican. Was not successful unfortunately, but it was worth it. I‚Äôm a good bit more liberal than Biden, but I can perfectly see his rationale for every position he supports, and that‚Äôs why our policy differences have never gotten in the way of my support for him."
8176,i'd be for it just to fuck with putin.
8177,"I mean, a failure to endorse legalizing weed would be a huge moral failing at this point in time. That shouldn‚Äôt be an issue in any way in 2020."
8178,"If Democrats were pro gun, they'd have a much larger voting base. 40% of American households own a gun and gun control is a big issue for them, but other centrist values / democratic values aren't. A huge portion of the Republican party votes Republican because of the 2nd amendment."

8182,"2008 was literally the election of senators.

Obama, Hillary, and Biden in the primaries along with others.

Obama and McCain in the general."
8183,They are actually still counting California and the margin is getting smaller and smaller. It was projected to be 10% and it's closer to 7.5% with about 3 million ballots still to count. Late breaking ballots are good for Biden so far.
8184,"The best thing the DNC did was drop super delegates from having influence unless no one wins the majority through states.  Really hard for Bernie to think he can change minds of all the delegates we‚Äôre won at state level.   I was a Warren supporter and I considered Bernie, but I‚Äôm seeing the same worrying patterns from 2016 that made me turn from him then.   I hope Joe wins it all today so we can pack this thing up and move on to kicking Trump‚Äôs ass."
8185,KaBOOM!!! There goes the last block! Sweet sweet southern Jebus tea!
8186,Yeah that's fair. Its key that we get AA turnout.
8187,Moved to Florida in 2018 and but my vote was still in Georgia that election (voted for Abrams) - so this was my first vote as a Floridian and proud to say that I voted for Joe.  Went in early voting on Sunday.
8188,"Agreed. We just really don't need any help in California so she's a little redundant, as much as I like and respect her."

8193,Messaged!
8194,"This is the main reason why Bernie lost my support years ago. When he started out, he seemed to be running the most positive campaign in among a mess of negativity. 

2020 Bernie has been a campaign of toxicity and lies. (2016 Bernie probably was too, but I was paying less attention then). 

I have made a lot of incorrect predictions, but one prediction that I was right about was that Sanders would have less support in 2020 than he did in 2016. I figured this would be a combination of the Democrats running stronger alternatives this time and more people waking up to the fact that Bernie is not the honest man fighting for the working class everyone thought he was. I‚Äôm glad that I was right."
8195,"So was bernies, he only came out publicly for gay marriage 3 years before them despite being pro-gay for decades. 

Those times were a huge political shift, everyone underestimated the electorate imo."
8196,"If they can win Michigan, they maybe, possibly, have a chance of continuing. It's not like it will suddenly slingshot everything into his favor."
8197,"No. It‚Äôs illegal in every state to have overlapping coverage because it gives the opportunity for unjust enrichment. Private insurance just has to come up with new products like they did in every other country. Try to buy two separate auto insurance policies on the same driver and car, the same rule preventing that is what‚Äôs in Sanders plan."
8198,Kavanaughs accuser didnt come out when he became a federal judge. She came out when she was nomonated to the Supreme Court. Theres a difference between being a second string nominee contender and the presumptive nominee.  It does us no favors tovpretend otherwise.

8220,"I saw someone on S4P today say ‚ÄúJoe Biden is so selfish by not dropping and encouraging seniors citizens to go out risk their lives by voting for him...‚Äù

But the only reason we‚Äôre still having primaries in the first place is because Sanders can‚Äôt accept that he lost.


There‚Äôs just no arguing with these people.  Anything that benefits Bernie is correct and moral.  And anything that benefits Biden is a lie and a conspiracy.  We just need to ignore them.  We‚Äôre not going to convince the conspiracy theorists to vote for Joe.  We just need all the reasonable ones to come over to our side."
8221,"But you don't see Dems threatening to withhold their votes in a very contentious election.

Progressives did it in 2016. They're doing it now.

""Liberals"" will get in behind the Nominee if he is the reason for Trump to not get re-elected.

A person who hands the election to a republican has no business in being called a progressive. This election is more than just M4A/Green New Deal. So much is on the line, and I implore for some of you to not be a one-issue voter"
8222,"Good thing your opinion doesn‚Äôt mean anything to me,"
8223,"If Joe wins every state tonight, I really think he should just ignore Sanders and go after Trump. Every ad should be able how he's better than Trump, every speech should just mention him and Trump, every tweet should just say that he will be Trump. This way, we can set ourselves up for the general, and plus it makes it look like the Biden nomination is no longer in question. Hopefully, that would make Sanders look like a second-tier candidate still duking it out in the primaries while the rest of the country has moved on."
8224,He didn‚Äôt. Amy has been in Minnesota for the last few weeks while her husband has been in DC

&gt; Decriminalize the use of cannabis and automatically expunge all prior cannabis use convictions. Biden believes no one should be in jail because of cannabis use. As president, he will decriminalize cannabis use and automatically expunge prior convictions. And, he will support the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes, leave decisions regarding legalization for recreational use up to the states, and reschedule cannabis as a schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts"
8227,"uh, what? The vast majority of the electorate is dem or republican. also, by net favourability it isn‚Äôt just dems and republicans, it asks everyone"

8234,"Im not a fan of UBI's and if Joe Biden publicly says he is looking at it it will give Trump more ammunation. 

The reason im not fan of UBI's is the immense costs and work ethic assoiciated with it. 

Experts calcuated that we would have to drop every form a social welfare and then even it would be super expensive. 

In my eyes it also discourages work. There are enough people who work who can live cheaply. There are people who can live off 1500$ a month and if you give it to them they will."

However, I guess we just have to accept that these people were never going to vote for Joe anyway.  They‚Äôre a tiny minority and not where the actual votes are.  They hate the Democratic Party more than they hate Trump.


We just have to welcome who we can from the Sanders camp and shake the rest off."
8247,"hey, for real, how am i meant to feel that Biden is a good vote when he says this:

""The younger generation now tells me how tough things are. Give me a break.""

i'm aware of the fact that this is somewhat out of context but it still inadvertently sums up his politics. nothing he's done makes me feel that he cares about the younger generation. his climate change policies are no where near enough and i truly don't think he grasps just how dire the situation is. more broadly than that though, i can't see him beating Trump, i really can't, why would people vote for a man who represents the same establishment and policies that had such a vicious backlash against it that allowed Trump to become President?"
8248,"Same, but it‚Äôs because of a deal Facebook made with CNN because of the coronavirus. It‚Äôs a CNN town hall so you could watch it on TV or on [this site](https://www.livenewsnow.com/american/cnn-news-usa.html)"

I get Bernie's socialist policies, I even sort of get Trump's authoritarianism. But only things I know of Biden is that he was VP during Obama's presidency and some memes that make fun of him. So I guess my question is that: do you vote for him because you genuinely believe he represents some of your views/interests? If so, what are they, other that ""getting rid of Trump""?

Sorry if my question is too generic, I'm quite ignorant when it comes to American politics, for which I apologize."

He could mean labor unions bc they‚Äôre classified similarly legally. And honestly I don‚Äôt think he should take their money either, just small dollar donate, BUT it is better to have labor unions than super PACs, because labor unions are one organization donating on behalf of all the members (unions have elected leaders), super PACs with billion and million are backers are only representing their specific interests, not the interests of many people. 

If joe means labor unions then I‚Äôd mark this partially lying. If he means what he said, super PACs, then if mark this lying."

We should leave the Sanders people alone till Bernie makes the choice to drop, give them a reasonable amount of time to mourn and THEN move forward.

Stand by your candidate. We all stood by Joe while he came in fourth and third in IA and NH. Stand by your candidate until your candidate makes the determination for them. We can argue all day that the writing is on the walls, that it‚Äôs time to unite. 

No. They deserve the same respect and time to breathe as we would‚Äôve needed had Biden collapsed. Stand by your candidate until the end. And when they move, you move with them when you‚Äôre ready.

Trump hates her which is a good thing IMHO. She's technically a Washington outsider.  Though honestly she's got soft support in MI, but I blame the GOP there. 

We don't need Kamala since Joe can carry the black vote, but she doesn't hurt us. We keep CA's senator. She is a pretty safe choice, but she really didn't get the votes while running that you would have thought. 

I like Amy, but I'm not sure there. Lots of positive and negatives, probably too polarizing to be honest."
8288,I dont know any spanish speaking latino that uses it. It doesnt make sense in spanish. Spanish is a gendered language  and if you want an english gender neutral term then just use latin no need for the x. The only people Ive ever heard use that term have been english speaking whites.
8289,"Thanks, I understand perfectly well how the world works with jobs.  Obviously there are people with college degrees who work in service industries, are unemployed, or in any other number of situations. That being said, 2/3 of Americans don't have college educations, and they're definitely working somewhere.


Congrats to your son, I'm sure you're very proud of him. I don't feel like he's ""lucky"" to ""only"" have $240k in debt, I'm sure he saw the terms of the loans, and he agreed to them. Regardless, it sounds like he's doing fine now, and will be for life. If you honestly believe that he should be entitled to student debt relief, than I'm sorry but I really can't take anything you say seriously. 

I don't know where you live, but $35k starting for teachers could be perfectly reasonable. Even if it's underpaid, I'm sure that like the rest of the US, it's not any more underpaid than a plethora of other industries. Where I live, public school teachers make close to or just over six figures, and the same narrative that they're underpaid persists.


The existing relief bill that just passed freezes college debt interest, so you've already gotten what you're asking for (at least partially). I'm completely on board with restructuring loan interest rates, and was before coronovirus. Same with eliminating debt for folks who go into less lucrative public service jobs (e.g., teaching)- those programs already exist and should be improved upon."

8307,"As the transcript says, Biden needs to work on outreach to under 45 Dems in general, not specifically Sanders voters so he can grow his margins. Non-Sanders voters are far more numerous than Bernie or Bust voters. But Biden still has work to do reaching out to voters under 45."

8311,"Agreed - and also recognize that regardless of how ""they"" treated you, you should treat them with dignity and respect.

The primaries have shown that a lot of dems don‚Äôt like Bernie, especially the wealthy middle aged people. A lot of the people who do like him (zoomers like myself) didn‚Äôt even show up to vote for the primary. 

I really feel like at this point it‚Äôs a crap shoot as to which nominee could win the general. However, it‚Äôs clear that Biden must inspire people, considering he is doing well in the primary."

8321,"I was going back and forth between Biden and Klobuchar for months. The night of the New Hampshire debate, I landed squarely in Klobuchar's camp - she really knocked it out of the park. My friends and I even donated to her campaign when she surprised us all by pulling a strong third in the New Hampshire primary.

I wasn't terribly disappointed when she dropped out earlier this week, though - quite the contrary, I think we all saw the writing on the wall and I was thrilled that she and Mayor Pete did the right thing for our party and our country. I'm 100% on Team Joe now (and contributed to his campaign a few days ago!)."
8322,"We'll just agree to disagree on Beto and leave it at that. :)

But I'm 100% with you on the tea party. It wasn't uncommon for me to vote for Republicans prior to 2010, but when the racist outcasts took over the party their was no way I could support anything they did until they fixed that. Instead, they gave us Trump.

I suspect Biden will pick a VP you may have to grit your teeth over, but nobody someone looking to switch sides will find horribly offensive. And ultimately I don't think people really pick candidates based on VP's."
8323,"As a former Pete supporter, Bernie is off the table for me. I wish you could see how dangerous, disingenuous, and divisive Bernie‚Äôs rhetoric really is. 

He regularly lies - about Biden‚Äôs voting record, about how Pete was ‚Äúfunded‚Äù by billionaires and the healthcare industry (both are objectively false), about how he won the IA caucus, etc.

Bernie‚Äôs campaign has regularly put out misinformation in the form of decontextualized quotes. Remember that Obama ad that quoted him saying ‚Äúfeel the bern,‚Äù which actually came from a speech endorsing Hillary? When Trump does it, everyone on the left agrees it‚Äôs propaganda. When Bernie does it, his base doesn‚Äôt care. Bernie‚Äôs campaign also does this repeatedly with Biden quotes.

Furthermore, Bernie has done more to make ‚ÄúDemocrat‚Äù and ‚Äúliberal‚Äù dirty words than Fox News ever will. He regularly explicitly calls the DNC corrupt and his enemy. How on earth do you or any of Bernie‚Äôs supporters expect to get anything done if his rhetoric literally directly attacks down-ballot Democrats? You realize that Dems are the ones who vote for left-wing policy, right?

The major problem with Bernie - and this is unique to Bernie - is that he is pure idealism. There‚Äôs no room for compromise, and if you ever aren‚Äôt perfect in every way, you‚Äôre a corrupt enemy who‚Äôs trying to destroy the working class.

He can‚Äôt even pass his own purity tests! Our Revolution is his dark money organization that has accepted multiple six-figure donations from undisclosed donors. When asked about it, Bernie basically said it was okay because everyone else does it. Leadership my butt. (Let me know if you need sources on how shady Our Revolution is.)

I really hope you can get out of the Bernie bubble and see exactly how ridiculous his campaign rhetoric is. I fell for it in 2016 and was shocked when Hillary beat him. Now I hate how na√Øve and uninformed I was back then.

(And none of this even mentions the unsubstantiated populist cries about media bias, the wonky Bernie Math, etc. It really looks like a cult from the outside.)"

Assuming that the cited source is what he used, I'll admit that the definition of ""underinsured"" was more reasonable than I anticipated. However, including currently insured people as uninsured/underinsured is ridiculous to the point of seeming like satire. It doesn't matter if they had coverage gaps, they're literally insured.

One reason is that places that had mandatory busing often increase enrollments in private religious schools so that the impact of busing was more segregation than just allowing people to go to school in their neighborhoods or for public school boards to come up with their own solution.

Kamala Harris went to school in Berkeley and they integrated the district due to local changes, not mandatory federal busing. So her slam on Biden made no sense."

üíéüêä"
8392,"Biden and Clinton are very different. I supported Sanders in 2016 after O‚ÄôMalley dropped out. Here is why I support Biden.

Biden is the strongest candidate on foreign policy. He has a deep well of experience simply unmatched by other candidates. As I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll agree, Trump has done serious damage to our foreign relations. This is a uniquely difficult time in the world, with democracy under threat from the rise of authoritarian nations and Trump has sided with dictators and has isolated us from our allies. Biden knows these leaders. He has spent time with these leaders. More than that, he truly understands the importance of NATO and democracy promotion. He understands that the actions taken in the next four years could likely determine the course of this century in human rights and global affairs. He is particularly strong on China. Biden has spoken with passion on the treatment of the Uyghurs and will make human rights an important issue in US-China relations, as it should be. He is the only candidate with a detailed plan for responding to a potential Chinese invasion of autonomous Hong Kong. He supports reviving something similar to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but with more worker‚Äôs rights protections and anti-outsourcing measures to create a powerful trading block of Pacific democracies to compete with China, and he has stated a willingless to consider options up to and including sanctions and economic isolation to pressure the Chinese government. He knows that a strong America is good for the world, and that the world‚Äôs democracies must unite to combat the tyrrany and corruption of nations such as Russia, China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. He supports using our considerable soft power, I.E. diplomatic influence, to push for justice. This is also the only true path to lasting peace, as democracies don‚Äôt go to war against other democracies. He rightly has strong reservations about using our military to solve problems that do not have a military solution or could be solved through diplomacy. He strongly opposed and argued against President Obama‚Äôs troop surge. 

Outside of foreign policy, he has the longest and strongest record of actually passing progressive legislation. He wrote the Violence Against Women Act. He helped pass the Assault Weapons Ban. As Vice President, he got our troops out of Iraq, pushed Obamacare through congress, helped negotiate the Iran Nuclear Deal, and was instrumental in various budget negotiations. He has deep relationships on Capitol Hill and the experience to get his proposals passed. He will add a public option, which will help put us on the path to a single payer system, which I support as the eventual goal. He will make the United States a global leader on climate change, creating thousands of new jobs. He will push for justice on issues from race to LGBT rights and more. He will appoint judges who understand that the constitution guarantees our rights, including the right for women to make their own decisions about their bodies. 

Furthermore, I would also posit that, in such uniquely challenging times in the world, now more than ever we need to elect a candidate who knows how to restore our standing in the world, and also that as the president has a particularly large amount of control over foreign policy that this issue is especially critical in the presidential race, as opposed to congressional races, which are less important for foreign policy. Take health care. Let‚Äôs say that you support enacting medicare for all immediately. electing a president who supports that does not ensure that that would get passed by congress, while electing a president who supports a public option instead does not ensure that negotiations with congress won‚Äôt result in medicare for all instead. The president has the power to sign and veto legislation, urge congress, and push for their positions. On foreign policy, though, electing a president who, let‚Äôs say, opposes making human rights a focus of U.S.-China relations almost certainly assures that they won‚Äôt be, while electing a president who supports that almost certainly assues that they will be. 

Also, it‚Äôs what people do when they think that no one is watching that provides the best view of their true nature. Biden‚Äôs true nature shows that he cares about people more than pretty much any politician. Here‚Äôs an example of what he does when he thinks that nobody is watching. From the very beginning of his political career, every time he ran for anything, this woman in Delaware would send him a $25 check. Not that long ago, she died. Joe was reading the newspaper and saw her name in the obituaries section. He had never met her, but he felt compelled to pay his respects. He went for a shiva call (Jewish mourning practice). There were no cameras, this was not a public relations stunt, and Joe never mentioned it. The story was brought to light by her family. 

Finally, Biden understands that America has rarely, if ever, lived up to anything anywhere near the lofty ideals that we hold, but he understands that there was a sense of pride and unity, optimism and determination, and idealism that has been lost. He wants to restore that, but as an inclusive vision that actually lives up to our aspirations and leaves no one behind. This is quite possibly our last chance to recapture that knowledge of what America can be, that vision of what our destiny can be, that was advanced by such figures as John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Frank Church, and Walter Mondale. Restoring that vision in the next few years could ensure it‚Äôs survival, while I fear that failing to bring that vision back now will mean that it could be gone forever. No one else running focuses on much beyond their individual policies. Many say they can unite us, but no one provides the unifying vision that we had, that we need. This is what makes America special. This vision is Joe Biden‚Äôs vision
(From his website)-Joe‚Äôs Vision:

‚ÄúWe are in a battle for the soul of America. It‚Äôs time to remember who we are. We‚Äôre Americans: tough and resilient. We choose hope over fear. Science over fiction. Truth over lies. And unity over division. We treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor. We are the United States of America. And together, there is not a single thing we cannot do.‚Äù

Joe also states on his website, ‚ÄúOur best days still lie ahead.‚Äù Let‚Äôs elect someone with the experience, tenacity, and vision to make this statement a reality. It‚Äôs not yet too late. If we work together, we can do it."
8393,NO WAY.
8394,Tell me one way Trump and Biden are different.
8395,"Off the top of my head: 

* Net Zero emissions by 2050

Rejoin paris climate accord. More nuclear energy. New carbon capture investments. All sorts of extra incentives for green energy and regulations on fossil fuels.

* Universal healthcare via a public option.

The ACA theoretically could have achieved universal coverage through a medicaid expansion but republican governors prevented it. So Joe is proposing a public option which will A) reduce premiums for everyone via introducing competitiveness, and B) will be available premium free to anyone who would normally be eligible for the medicaid expansion but was denied it by republicans, C) subsidizes it for middle income people.

* Expand DACA + Pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants
* Reverse Trump tax cuts + higher taxes for wealthy (many details on his site on this)
* $15 minimum wage
* Abolish death penalty
* Eliminate private prisons
* Free public 2 year college
* Rejoin Iran Nuclear deal
* Support a two state solution, oppose Israeli annexation of the Palestinian territories"

8397,"Yes, that Gaetz, literally the worst rep in the HoR"
8398,Leave Wilmington and head south.  Most of the state is rural.

Agreed. I generally want the country to move to the left on policy, just to do so in a pragmatic way that actually delivers and maintains progress."

If the virus gets him first, the benefit of being rid of him is well worth missing out on the trial. That benefit can be measured in more-deserving lives saved, not just from coronavirus but in health care, immigration, environmental regulation, and all the other ways Trump's uniquely bad decisions are getting people killed. And I'd much rather he be killed by his own negligence than by someone who would have to go to jail for it."

I think it's run by the Trump campaign- they don't allow any kinds of debate, even around Bernie and his policies. And even other candidates talking about him is deleted from there. 

Only a Trump supporter would stop everyone from talking as much as they do there.   Real berniebros have never acted that way imo. Believe me, they have banned more bernie supporters than warren or biden people/"

8456,It sure is tokenism. Identity politics at its finest.
8457,"I mean, she dropped out. How is she splitting it? Or are you suggesting she'd endorse Bernie and that would send all her support to him?

I'm kinda confused."
8458,"What are the odds Bernie comes out with a plan tomorrow to freeze rent for more than 4 months &amp; have landlords pay their tenants?

‚ÄúHow will you carry out that plan?‚Äù

‚ÄúUhhh 1% uhhh Medicare 4 All‚Äù"
8459,"Great post!  I wasn‚Äôt a Pete supporter, so only learned about the RotR yesterday.  But thank you guys for bringing them here.


With Bloomberg dropping out, Joe‚Äôs nomination is inevitable everybody.  We have the majority of the Democratic Party in our lane.  That doesn‚Äôt mean we should get complacent, but we have to be honest that this train is ultimately going to keep rolling until November.


That means we have to be understanding and respectful to Sanders supporters from here on out.  I know I‚Äôm going to try to keep from getting angry with their attacks because I know they‚Äôre coming from a place of sadness.  But if we‚Äôre welcoming and understanding, we can start building the movement that is going to carry the Democratic Party to victory.  Both to the White House and to Congress.


We‚Äôre going to win in November.  And we‚Äôre going to bring real change to Washington and to America."
8460,Right. Thanks for the help.
8461,"that seems to be good, but why did Biden state in his Missouri speech that ""we must re-elect Donald Trump""?"
8462,No truer words my friend.
8463,My dad is in the same boat as you. Let‚Äôs all win together.
8464,"Huh, sure seems like a lot of Democrats are rushing to endorse the only Democrat still running for the Democratic nomination.

Or as certain other subs would call it, election rigging and establishment interference."
8465,"&gt; 
&gt; my problem with Warren and Sanders's focus on this is that the college educated already have a leg up on a lot of working class people (having graduated) and likely got in bc they got better primary and secondary educations than poorer kids. but Warren's plan is more progressive than Sanders and Biden also has a plan that's pretty close to anything that's pretty close anything that could pass Congress.
&gt; 
&gt; 

omg, so much this.

Back in last December, when Pete was trying to draw a contrast with his plan (Make colleges free for the bottom 80%, help people with the debt with refinancing &amp; expansion of public service plan etc), Pete's subreddit got brigaded HARD by Bernie folks over this issue.

And, because I had absolutely nothing better to do at the work in the morning...

I did quick math on 'who would benefit from loan forgiveness &amp; free college the most' based on the numbers I got from higher ed resource centers. (Wish I kept the receipts...it has been months now)

According to my math, about 1/3 of the 4-year public school attendees are from the top 20% of the income bracket.

And, the attendance rate decreases linearly along the line of income bracket.

This basically means, as of current, the free college and loan forgiveness program basically is a massive tax cut for the top 20%.

And, to make this worse, this pattern of top 20% seeing the most benefit is likely to get even worse if/when 'free college for public schools' actually get passed.

You are going to see a dramatic increase in # of students who would've otherwise gone to private institutions like Duke, SMU, USC, and etc....to its equivalent public institutions like UNC, UT, UCLA, and etc.

As that happens, the competition for 'college entrance resume' would further escalate....and folks with better resources are going to have an upper hand in that competition.

I wish I had the data to draw some more napkin-math conclusion on this one.

I would love to have a set of data on each States' top 3 flagship Universities' student family income."
8466,"can they just ask ppl, if your candidate is not the nominee will you vote socialist? 

and stop beating around the bush"
8467,OMG how cool would it be if he could pick Obama
8468,I‚Äôm glad he voted!! I‚Äôm genuinely confused as I am new to voting and I was able to do it by mail... why doesn‚Äôt everyone do it by mail?? Do certain states not allow voting by mail??
8469,"I just want my country back. So much, so many things this clown has screwed up with incompetence. The rule of law though, may be my number one concern. But the killing of the journalist and the threat to freedom of speech kicked it off for me. So thankful for the unity, cannot express it enough."
8470,"Perhaps. I definitely agree it hurt, but ultimately she didn't turn out the moderate vote in those counties. Some of it was simply that the Republican campaign to paint her as an elite who didn't care about the rural workers worked.  I know it's untrue, but that's campaigns."
8471,It means there are still a lot of states left to vote and he‚Äôs been polling higher in states where voters are more educated. If Biden is the leading candidate he should continue to debate and prove he‚Äôs the front runner until he crosses the finish line. Trump‚Äôs not going to give him a break if he decides he doesn‚Äôt want to debate.
8472,Hillary has too much baggage. Would remind too much of Trump beating her last time. Prefer Kamala Harris to her for sure.
8473,.....Bernie Math repeats again
8474,Biden is doing all this while being outspent massively. WOW.
8475,Bernie looks horrid. Like he's been yelling at people all day.
8476,AOC is too young. She won't be eligible for about another 5 years.
8477,"All I ask is that whether you support Biden or Bernie in the primary, you go and support the nominee in November, put aside apathy (if you get it) and realize this will affect you for years to come not just four more year."
8478,"Politico is full of shit.  That's because Biden is a corporate whore who has been and is a stooge for insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, wall-street and oil &amp; gas. He's a fucking whore who sold his soul for political power and he won't do a damn thing for ANYONE who isn't already rich. He's a fucking loser and a lying bastard who is more of a Reagan Republican that a Democrat. Too bad lots of people are so fucking stupid they think he'll be different than Trump. Biden is the same bastard who has been trying to cut social security, medicare and medicaid. What the fuck is WRONG with people?"
8479,"Nooo, you're supposed to say M4A isn't socialism, and then I tell you Sanders wants to force companies to give workers ownership and control of the means of production. Then you say that isn't socialism because only anarcho socialism is socialism and also what I described is the ideal system anyways because capitalism ous inherently flawed."
8480,Dogs should be able to vote
8481,"True, I never even heard of the Warren story until today"
8482,"You post in r/enough_sanders_spam. You even call his legitimate reason for voting no as an ""excuse"". Your bias is keeping is obvious."
8483,One way your definitely not going to get Bernie supporters to vote for joe is with your shit attitudes. Congrats on contributing to trump winning.
8484,"These are great reasons to support Bernie! I‚Äôm a Pete person who‚Äôs almost certainly supporting Biden at this point, but I definitely appreciate Bernie. Should Biden find himself in the White House (as a resident, not a guest!) I hope and expect you‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised by his genuine concern for ordinary Americans."
8485,"It wasn't the best look and will be used by Trump and his PACs to energize his base. I've already heard several uncommitted politically gun people already moving into the anti-Biden camp after reading his policies and seeing the Beto endorsement and that video. As a liberal gun owner, I value the bigger things in the platform like healthcare, infrastructure, foreign policy, and bringing civility back into the office, so I'm still supporting Joe even if I think he is ignorant on guns. I can even support things like UBCs, lengthening auto-approval timeframes, and database sharing but some things in his platform (such as banning modern retail and manufacturing) if he really pushes for will kill goodwill on getting the more reasonable things passed."
8486,"Klobuchar would be my pick too - she's also shown that she's a decent campaigner too, given the fact that in the primaries she somehow outlasted media and party darlings and favorites like O'Rourke and Harris to exceed expectations. She's good at working with the Midwest and Rust Belt, and she still checks the diversity box.

I also want to see her and Buttigieg together on the same administration because it'd be kinda funny (besides the fact I'm sure they'll be very competent members of a Biden administration)."
8487,And they were still wrong in 2016
8488,It‚Äôll be like having four years of Phil Dunphy after four years of Lucille Bluth at her absolute worst.
8489,"Holy shit this literally happened

https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo"
8490,"Yes, their incompetence doesn't mean we should do wrong things to take advantage of it.  We should run a clean campaign and condemn this."
8491,"I think Bernie wants good things but is too ego driven to understand that he might not be the only one trying. 

It's not the Twitter trolls I care about. It's the people who used to be close personal friends who are spewing hate at anyone who doesn't think Bernie is the second coming of Jesus.

They weren't always like this. They've been fed the rhetoric so long that it's become a way of life."
8492,"Sorry, but due to CDC guidelines, we're actually using an Amtrak at the moment."
8493,"One of the volunteer coordinators told me he was on here too. That was back when it was, like, 4000 subs, so I was thinking, ah shit, hope he doesn‚Äôt know who I am!"
8494,That could genuinely put Utah in play
8495,"MALARKEY ALERT - YOU JUST POSTED MALARKEY. 

Please remove all items from your pockets like keys, phone, wallet, but most importantly, REMOVE YOUR MALARKEY."
8496,"It unfairly and arbitrarily provides financial assistance to a select proportion of the population, especially a population that is more likely to be higher earners."
8497,"This isn‚Äôt a wrong thing. The Biden camp probably doesn‚Äôt even know about this. It‚Äôs harmless and satirical. It clearly opens to Joe‚Äôs website, it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs hiding where it leads you"
8498,"I meant that I don't know who they are. I don't follow a bunch of bernie accounts on social media so I don't know who is specifically being called out.  

But thank you. I can try my best to tell other sanders supporters that certain people in his campaign are problematic and need to either tone it down or gtfo."
8499,Sometimes it really does seem like something fishy is a foot to push us away from each other.
8500,Lol too many holes
8501,[Now playing...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0eeSoU35wM)
8502,"Good. It is actually quite different in my area in NC. A lot of Biden supporters scoff at the idea of voting for Bernie, even though they can‚Äôt stand Trump. What I get from my conversations with them is that they are afraid of him losing to Trump, which nobody wants, but the logic of refusing to vote for him because you‚Äôre afraid of him losing to Trump in a race between him and Trump escapes me fully. It hurts to hear this crap from people."
8503,So far the biggest argument I've heard from people is that they are voting for him because they believe he could win and not really because they believe he should. I think knowledge of the job is wonderful especially after Trump's clear lack of it. But it seems like we're going from one extreme to the other and for me I'd just like to get a nice balance. Biden seems liberal but he hasn't been until recently and that's what I'm worried about. His mind does seem to be deteriorating as well. I'm not really arguing with you I guess. I'm just really unsure. But it's not like I have any choice in the matter now.
8504,The thing about Latinos is they‚Äôre more concentrated in the southwest.  Mostly in states that have already voted or don‚Äôt have many delegates.  Bernie has no real path to victory and it‚Äôs all his own doing.
8505,"Take your anger out by helping Biden win.  You can help Biden win by reaching out to Bernie supporters in a calm, measured way, even when they frustrate you."
8506,"I know, but every local outlet in Ohio is reporting the exact opposite."
8507,On MSNBC last night I saw a Bernie ad Attacking Joe.
8508,"If you're not with me, you're my enemy! 

*looks at Elizabeth Warren*

You've turned her against me!!!"
8509,"Right but they centered around a candidate that had a weaker base and weaker debate performances at the expense of the stronger base and stronger debate performances.

I don't imagine that if Pete and Amy would have endorsed Bernie, that Biden would still be trailing by less than 50 delegates. They joined with him to save his weak campaign, not to build the strongest possible anti Trump campaign. My concerns are the climate, healthcare, education and stopping endless wars. I don't feel like Biden takes those seriously. I know that Bernie does. He has fought for them for 50 years at the EXPENSE of his ego. People like to point out his low bill passing rate, but they aren't brave enough to support him because they worry about their own personal careers."
8510,He'll find out soon enough. Don't spoil it for him just yet. üòà
8511,"From what I'm aware, Jim Clyburn is said to have an influential role in determining the nominee. Even in a recent interview, he suggested Biden should select a black woman - even bringing up Kamala and Val Demings by name. So, I guess it might be plausible?"
8512,I'm sorry to learn this.  Do we have a flair for you (can't check due to the system I'm on)?
8513,She was like batman.
8514,"She's a fairly well liked, non-controversial local figure with a decent voting record and no serious skeletons. She's not experienced enough, but she had executive experience as the police chief of Orlando and has served two terms as a Congress woman. She can handle the national press, and she looks younger than her age (she looks mid 50s, when she is in her early 60s). Her husband is the Mayor of Orange County (you can be a mayor of a county in FL), and is basically the top elected official in central Florida. 

Add all that together, and she may be able to boost turnout a bit....there have been studies that the VP turnout from a home state is minimal, but in a case like FL....even a minimal increased turnout of 10 k can make a huge difference. 

Nelson and Gillum only lost by 10-20k. When you add in all of the above about Demings, Puerto Ricans (born on the island) resettled in FL and  how they can vote if they live on the mainland (and many dislike Trump for how he handled Maria), former prisoners being given their voting rights back, and the fact that FL is about to unfortunately be badly hurt by Corona....

Well, there's an advantage to Demings."
8515,"I'm a Bernie supporter but like Biden too.  I don't think anyone really won that debate.  I expected Biden to falter,  but thought he did better than I expected (at least when not having to list off more than 4 talking points). I'm glad Bernie is shifting Biden a bit more progressive which is my biggest hang up with Biden.  I also liked how they're both committed to supporting the nominee and they honestly look like they like each other personally.. just have some fundamental differences in the way they want to achieve the same thing."
8516,Education would make sense
8517,I am also curious to see his work towards abortion rights which is another issue he recently changed his stance on. I worry he will put certain issues on the back burner due to his personal history but I hope I am wrong on this.
8518,Makes sense. I won't vote for biden unless he picks a progressive VP.
8519,30 days.
8520,What vote splitting happened?
8521,"Per 538: Washington and Idaho are right now the only states Bernie is projected to win, but only by slight margins. 

If we take those it would be huge. I hate that it's not a given Bernie drops before July even in the event he loses every state past Super Tuesday, but that would up the pressure on him considerably"
8522,"Fake news, only Bernardo Superhero Sanders can beat Trump! Good luck DNC without MY super special exciting vote!"
8523,"Well you clearly didn't listen to the president, he's talking about your 409k. Stupid liberal."
8524,"Can't read, paywall."
8525,"It has literally nothing to do with COVID. He's letting the Bernie or Bust crowd bully him into adopting a slice of one of Bernie's horrible, unfair, ridiculous policies."
8526,You couldn‚Äôt be more correct.
8527,Did this article really come out yesterday? All of that is old news. Biden has been sitting on his ass all week .
8528,"I know the limits of anecdata, but most all Warren supporters I know personally were big Clinton backers in the 2016 elections, both primary and general. Many were open in their disdain for the idea of Sanders running again at all. They're not Biden fans and they might just sit the primary out but there is no way they would back Bernie. A lot of people seem to think it's all about straightforward white paper comparisons and it's simply not."
8529,"I agree it's very similar. But Europe doesn't explicitly ban private insurance. In the Bernie Sanders plan, he'll basically shut down the private insurance industry in the U.S.

Beyond that not being realistic, it's something not even Europe and countries like Australia touch.

8531,I'm from WA and can only explain Whatcom County in the NW corner of the state (quite Liberal university with unusually good voter turnout). The Cascades going for Bernie is a bit odd.
8532,"Massachusetts isn't included in this [reference](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vacancies-in-the-united-states-senate.aspx) as one of the states that requires the gubernatorial appointment to match the party of the previous senator. The states noted to have that rule are Arizona, Hawaii, Maryland, North Carolina, Utah, and Wyoming."
8533,No. But you can be hot and have bad ideas
8534,As a former Bernie supporter I'm beyond annoyed. Bernie is only helping Trump at this point and taking money away from people who need it
8535,Where is Bernie?
8536,"Tbh I don't see CU overturned. As much as I hate what has come of it, the logic behind the ruling is sound. If bob and bill can collect money to raise awareness of conserving wild antelope, Koch and ConocoPhillips can collect money to fight climate science. There is a difference in scale, but the logic is the same. Public funding of elections would be the ultimate solution, but no one is talking about that so far."
8537,"Trump is just positioning himself to not have to take responsibility for the COVID-19 response failure. ""He attempted to reopen the country after a reasonable\* 3-week slow down!""

He's hedging that if (when) the economic numbers take a huge shit, they're not his responsibility but Democratic governors'."
8538,"He wants to stay in, let him stay in.  But there will be no more debates, no more national stage, just a steady flow of brutal primary defeats leading up to the convention.  Sad."
8539,"Washington votes by mail only. Ballots have already arrived, and Covid-19 isn't bad enough that people can't make it to a mailbox."
8540,"Because AOC is the gatekeeper that none of us asked for, but that we all need. ü§£"
8541,Eh not him
8542,I think they both are under the impression that they are doing good for America. It‚Äôs just a matter of whether that is true to the rest of America besides their followers.
8543,"Hitler created volkswagen... Also his plan for building up the autobahn to link military bases across Germany was used by Eisenhower to build the interstate. Bernie said Castro had a good system of education, he is not stating Castro is a good leader. If Bernie believed in the totalitarian/authoritarian government Castro leads why the fuck is he running for president instead of orchestrating a coup de taut? Sweden is socialist and while it‚Äôs policies may resemble China‚Äôs it does not align itself with China and does not have an authoritarian dictatorship running the country."
8544,"-Much of Biden‚Äôs platform can actually get passed into legislation. Most of Bernie‚Äôs main policies have zero chance based off of the political realities we have to acknowledge.

-Not only is Biden best positioned to win the presidency, he will have a better down-ballot effect than Bernie. The candidates who flipped Republican districts in the house and won swing states in the senate were all much closer to Biden in terms of policies. All of the very progressive candidates that won primaries in swing districts lost.

-We live in a representative democracy that is supposed to represent the will of the people. Our political system is built on compromise and negotiation. I know this may be a bitter pill to swallow but the vast majority of the country‚Äôs politics sit somewhere in the middle of the political spectrum, including the Democratic Party. A lot of these people, despite what a lot of Bernie supporters think, are making these decisions and forming their opinions in good faith and based off of research and knowledge of the policies and political realities, much like I assume you did in your support of Bernie. I think the best candidate for the health and the progress of the country is one most closely aligned to the average voter, than one that is regarded as more radical."
8545,"Get real...he‚Äôs not going to be lobbying softballs.


This is his last-ditch attempt to save his campaign.  He‚Äôs going to be criticizing Joe‚Äôs policies all night and probably even get some personal attacks in (and then justify them by saying he was directing them toward‚Äôs ‚ÄúJoe‚Äôs Polcies‚Äù).


This is just Bernie being selfish.  Again."
8546,I'm black for reference and I almost get a white savior complex from some of Bernies supporters who act like us blacks don't know any better for not supporting Bernie.  That alone makes me jump on the Biden train even more.
8547,"It‚Äôs pretty damn rare, especially in a field that is this big. Hillary did it too in 2016, but that was with only 2 people running. This time 8 people were running."
8548,"And the chances of pot being legalized would be infinitely higher with Joe than they are with Trump. He‚Äôs already said he wants it legal for medical and research, and wants to decriminalize...from reading through threads on here about this, it sounds like it‚Äôll basically end up being legal."
8549,She‚Äôs a hero and her recovery was remarkable. Much respect for her.
8550,"The usual ‚ÄúChina planted this to cause WW3 and take over Iran‚Äù.

8552,"Wingapo (Greetings),

I‚Äôm one of the founders/mods of /r/IndianCountry, the most popular indigenous subreddit.

I stickied this article to the top of our sub for a few days because Biden 2020 did not have a known, established Federal Indian Policy, as other candidates made known.

I [previously commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/comments/f43nc0/this_is_bernies_plan_on_how_to_empower_tribal/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=IndianCountry&amp;utm_content=t1_fjrzy8b) on the field as it stood a little over 3 weeks ago.

[PERSONALLY, emphatically speaking for myself](https://twitter.com/kirosauld/status/1237799990455676930?s=21), Biden has the best Federal Indian Policy among the remaining candidates. 

My only caveat is I hoped Biden would endorse or exceed [The Honoring Promises to Native Nations Act](https://haaland.house.gov/media/press-releases/haaland-warren-release-legislative-proposal-address-chronic-underfunding-and) drafted by Rep. Deb Haaland, in consultation with Federal Indian Policy Stakeholders and Wonks. Specifically, I hoped a Biden Administration would adopt its:

* **Oliphant Fix** (Tribal Court prosecution of non-Indian Offenders; same rights);
* **Carcieri Fix** (all Tribes Equal under the Indian Reorganization Act, which affects EVERYTHING);
* **Mandatory Tribal Consultation Provision**
* **Cabinet-Level Tribal Consultation Czar**

That may or may not happen and requires 51 votes in the Senate, assuming elimination of the filibuster.

Anyway, I‚ÄôM HERE FOR BUSINESS:

#Where is the 3/3/2020 Federal Indian Policy release from Biden 2020?

It is referenced in the article, but I cannot find it independently anywhere:

&gt; The following statement was released by the Biden for President on Tuesday, March 3, 2020

There‚Äôs enough misinformation out there and ignorance is actively dangerous.

**If Biden is the nominee, and he will most certainly be, the Native Vote, especially in key places with razor-thin margins, ought not be disengaged or discouraged for the false impression that Indian Country is an afterthought.**

This will make our job of informing people, giving them a fair basis for their decisions, easier. **Your community is also welcome to participate, Native or not,** so long as our basic rules (mostly civility) are honored.

Any link/document that could be offered would be appreciated.

Thank you.

8572,"I think when the dust settles, people are going to realize both Trump and Bernie were riding a wave of dislike of HRC as much as their own popularity.   While I think it was unfair, HRC gave some people a really negative vibe."

8574,It‚Äôs just the first Joe Biden thread I saw today and figured I‚Äôd do my looking around here
8575,Or show them [this](https://www.facebook.com/cnn/videos/joe-biden-connects-with-new-hampshire-boy-over-struggle-with-stuttering/202710620871657/) . I have a son with speech dysfluency aka stutter and this line of attack is angering me to no end. When is Sanders going to do that outreach to suburban women? Not anytime soon apparently.
8576,"Yeah, those ""Biden has dementia"" comments you make are definitely just curiosity."
8577,It's an impossibility if Bernie is at the top of the ticket.
8578,"I slapped them out of my moms hands. I was angry at her for it that not only did I proceed to lash at her, but she started to scream at me before storming and crying out my room. I can‚Äôt fucking believe this is all happening, and no I‚Äôm not talking about that corona-whatever it is. I‚Äôm talking about the race! I thought Bernie had a multi-racial coalition and was bringing non-voters! I want a future to believe in where by the time I turn 21, not only do I have all of my student loans payed off but healthcare! This is so fucked..."
8579,All four released a joint statement that they are going forward.
8580,Idk about that but Iowa should defs be at least undecided on malarkey
8581,"Ayuh, that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs doing right now. He hasn‚Äôt dropped yet, but it‚Äôs coming soon I bet."
8582,"Damn, tbh I was hoping to read some comments that would make me like Joe more, this just makes me feel even less sure."
8583,"I acknowledged that he wasn't technically running yet, so I got it wrong. But ""lie"" implies intentionally saying something that's not true. The more important point, which I just repeated, is that Biden has long held the position that it's right to cut SS and Medicare for the sake of balancing the budget. That's a fact, with years of video evidence. 

I think harping on my small error in order to bulldoze the main point is pretty dishonest! I admit my error. 

Of course, it makes sense that he doesn't campaign on it, it's a ridiculously unpopular position. That Joe has held for years!"
8584,"&gt;he refuses to back M4A or the GND

8586,I'm a millennial supporter of Biden and I got kicked off r/politics so I can't make my voice heard there in the first place.
8587,And the Hill.
8588,What are you referring to?
8589,"No one is denying it. 

At the end of the day, the USSR still educated people and created a new generation of engineers, doctors, and leaders that allowed it to turn into an industrialized power from an agricultural mess. This is history. This is not an opinion. 

Do you think those literacy programs helped the average Russian? Do you think the USSR could've been in the Cold War if they didn't prioritize it first?

Again, stop assuming I'm advocating for authoritarian governments. Bottom line, there are good things and bad things from everything. 

If it wasn't for the Nazis, Operation Paperclip would've never happened and we wouldn't of gotten our edge as quickly as we did. 

This isn't politics, this is plain history."

8594,"I think in retrospect that really speaks volumes to the hubris of Clinton and her campaign. I think that's what people resented. She entered the campaign because she was entitled to it, she just deserved to be nominated and then elected, especially when Trump was nominated. They never bothered looking at the warning signs and to this day they'd rather blame the Russians than take responsibility.

8598,I had many issues with Bloomberg as a candidate for president that I don't have as Bloomberg as a person or political activist.
8599,"Welcome, a lot of us Pete supporters are here, the Biden camp has been extremely welcoming.   
  
I know we've kept our sub up, and I would assume you will as well. I know it's helped a lot of us to still have that space.   
  
The world has the UN, we have the coalition of decency, welcome aboard."
8600,He will be supporting another candidate as well they said
8601,"Well a hot ticket item is healthcare. The hard to swallow pill is that Bernie will sink down ballot Democrats he needs to pass any progressive legislature. Republicans would retake the house and gain ground in the Senate. M4A would certainly fail with not only Republicans voting against it, but also most remaining Democrats. 

Joe's plan is to build on Obamacare, which yes we all know the Republican rhetoric on that, BUT the price tag on Joe's plan would make it much much easier to convert some Republicans, should they maintain a Senate majority.

It boils down to extremely difficult policy proposals crashing and burning in the Senate, or pragmatic proposals passing through and in to law."
8602,No to complacency.  Complacency in November 2016 is how we got into this mess!
8603,u/affectionateexample
8604,"Bernie said if M4A passes congress would he veto it.   I think the hurdle would be to get past congress, not Biden's signature.   So Biden can say yes that he won't veto it if by some stretch of the imagination it gets through both houses of congress."
8605,"I would rather not have a experienced liar in office, we already have one of them right now.  It seems as though just recently He got caught lying about the iraq war, and lying about trying to cut federal funding including Medicare, Medicaid, social security, and all other social programs.  

When I say establishment I mean, both parties.  The democrats make us believe that they hate trump so bad, but they passed all of awful his policies including to inc the war budget &amp; cuts to social programs.  There are so many things that aren‚Äôt covered on main stream media.  It seems as though Americans are being mass distracted.  

Reasons I don‚Äôt want the established politicians is mainly because of the lobbiests and big corporation donations.  It seems to me that career politicians have been writing bills in favor of the rich, elite billionaires.  For example why hunter Biden is on the board of the Ukraine oil company making 50k per month while he is sitting in rehab for a heroin addiction.  Big pharma and the medical communities are gauging the middle class, and there are still 27 million Americans that still don‚Äôt have healthcare.  My significant other can‚Äôt afford to pay for his own healthcare.  I can‚Äôt afford to have an emergency visit.  As an RN I am living paycheck to paycheck &amp; can‚Äôt afford a medical emergency.   

In his education bill, he made it so universities could inflate pricing for college education, also, so that when people have hundreds of thousands in student loans they aren‚Äôt able to file bankruptcy on their education costs, when he talked about it he said ‚Äúthey knew what they were getting themselves into‚Äù 

There are hundreds of cities that have water worse than flint - flint still doesn‚Äôt have clean water.  I understand where your coming from, I see that the system is broken.  &amp; it seems as though Joe Biden has played a major role.  &amp; it seems as though he really doesn‚Äôt care about us.  Just wait and see who the people of Michigan vote for.  A month before leaving Obama went to flint with out fixing any of their water problems and sat in front of them took a sip of water said it was from their pipes and told them it was fine.  Meanwhile their babies have permanent brain damage, they will have to take care of their handicapped children for life always wondering what it would be like if their children hadn‚Äôt drank that water.  And spending The little money they do have on bottled water because the water is still contaminated.   

Bernies taxes would go up with Medicare for all, however I would not have to pay for healthcare and that would ultimately save me about 1200 per year according to my calculations with my income.  My partner would have health insurance.  My patients wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about forever being in debt because of their health.  The biggest thing with M4A is that it‚Äôs a single payer system &amp; hospitals and pharmaceuticals can‚Äôt mark up their products and services 300-500%.  Drug prices would drastically go down, people would be able to afford their life saving medications.  It seems as though Biden has multiple pharmaceutical &amp; medical corporations donating huge contributions to his campaign &amp; it seems is bought and paid for by them and has no problem taking their money.  Most likely will have them on the committee to help write more bills in favor of the elites best interest just like Obama.  

Not to mention the banks.  The amount of our tax dollars spent on bailing out the banks would have paid of the student loan debts 10x over.  Did you hear about how the trump administration just bailed out the banks again just a few months ago?  Probably not - because Obama made it into law that the politicians didn‚Äôt have to notify the public when they bail out banks and big corporations.    

We would end these wasteful, pointless, costly wars - for which, continued under the established Democratic Party - fully supported by joe Biden, which costs the average family of four 80,000 dollars over 10 years.  &amp; which our tax dollars are currently spending 5.5 million dollars per hour.  Did you read Afghanistan papers by the NYT?  They didn‚Äôt even know what or why they were there for 18 years.   The military and defense contractors were making huge profits from our tax dollars and they didn‚Äôt even know why.  Obama never ended the awful war, only got us into 7 more.  And who fights those wars?  The  Middle class.  All of us down here on the bottom.

These are the reasons why I don‚Äôt understand and am so confused about why anyone who isn‚Äôt a multi millionaire would vote for demented can‚Äôt speak a full sentence joe.   Are you one of the elites?  Do you make over a million per year?  

It seems as though we are living in an empire, just like the ones where the rich and powerful wear fancy clothes and wigs and huge poofy dresses &amp; the peasants have rags to wear, no affordable housing, &amp; have no medical services.  The only difference is the elites blend in better with the peasants and the peasants think they are on their side because those silly people on the stupid box tells them what to think.   

So, What about these issues caused from Joe and his establishment is childish?"

8616,"The markets were increasing at a steady pace and the fed started raising rates in 2015, not 2017. That wasnt the cause for inflation though. The cause was the horrendous tax cuts Trump passed.

8617,MAKE CALLS FOR JOE IF YOU'RE NOT ALREADY! It's super simple. Link is in the OP.

8622,"really is that why every democrat is a watered down version of sanders 2016 campaign? Hes raised class, race, and gender issues to the forefront unlike any other politician and if you want to compare records, Biden has done far more to devastate democratic values over the years by siding with republicans more than any other person running on the left."
8623,Welcome! It‚Äôs a party now
8624,I predict big things for this Pete guy.
8625," I want to help joe here is my story.

For the last decade I have campaigned on behalf of myself and all those suffering from this devastating disease. Why do I have to campaign? I do it because over five million Americans have Alzheimer‚Äôs, and other forms of dementia. And what is more shocking is the lack of knowledge out there about this illness.

People look at me and think there is nothing wrong; I am not in a wheelchair, I have full use of all my limbs, I can see, hear, speak and listen‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but not for much longer.

I can no longer write or speak like I used to, what you are reading now has been written by a friend of mine who helps me put my words onto paper. My friends have become distant and even when in their presence they will address my wife when enquiring after me. This is heartbreaking for me as the fact that they feel they can no longer talk to me really saddens me."
8626,"I mean I guess, but I dislike the way politicians' family members are basically turned into party placards. It just seems so corporate."

8631,And you expect Biden supporters to vote for Bernie in the general after saying things like this why exactly?
8632,"Goalpost .... moved!

I don‚Äôt know how joe Biden, literally one of the poorest politicians out there, became a ‚Äúcorporate lobbying puppet‚Äù (whatever that means):


&gt;Even so, the Biden‚Äôs personal finances were not in great shape. That same disclosure also listed liabilities worth at least $780,000. Since 1998, when Biden built his home in Wilmington, he has frequently refinanced the property over the years. Before Biden‚Äôs son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015, the vice president said he was worried his son would have to resign from his job as Delaware‚Äôs attorney general while he was sick, and he considered selling his Wilmington house to help out his son. President Barack Obama discouraged him from selling the place, stepping in to say he would personally lend him the money if he needed it.

So yeah, in terms of personal net worth he‚Äôs not Bloomberg and he apparently took Bernie‚Äôs advice‚Äîwhat money he has came from a book tour, just like Bernie."
8633,"Yea, I know it's *extremely* unlikely.  But could you humor me?"
8634,"It's still a stunning 4 out of 6. For now.

Washington still hasn't updated their vote count since 10 hours ago lol."
8635,"Wow, if only there was something each one of them could do to help ensure Joe Biden got more votes than Trump on election day."
8636,No need to be rude dude. Remember ROTR.
8637,Correct. Former presidents and vice presidents are called Mr. [Vice] President for the remainder of their lives. He carries the title Vice President forever.
8638,"A brother supports his brother.  Well, I'm glad Sanders hasn't alienated him.

Edit: I'm guessing this is the most prominent endorsement Sanders has received in a while, so maybe we should try to be supportive."
8639,Clinton vs Obama was close but not particularly harsh.
8640,His policies and his empahsis on unity.
8641,Lmao why?

8646,odd my Ballot had the name Joseph R(something) Biden
8647,"That's a disingenuous argument not being made in good faith, I know what you're trying to do, and the simple answer is, he doesn't."
8648,"Can we point out that we ALL align with Democratic Socialism? That's what really pisses me off about Sanders supporters, but to an extent even some moderates. There is so much more that unites us than divides us.

We ALL want expanded healthcare. Just...Biden and moderates do not believe in going so radical with it, that even Europe would be like ""yeah..um.. no thanks""

We ALL want reductions in college tuition and believe it's out of whack. It's just making outlandish promises that'll never pass the smell test helps no one.

We ALL want infrastructure reforms to boost alternative energy.  We just don't believe that somehow cutting off all natural gas consumption is realistic like flipping a light switch like Bernie believes.

  
Etc etc.

We all believe in Democratic Socialism. The foundations of social programs IS just this!  The problem is the term has been perverted by right minded people as Communism while those on the far left use it to try and moderate the fact that they have unrealistic radical goals."
8649,"Bernie was against superdelegates, but when push came to shove and they were his only path, he said they should support the most electable candidate (i.e. him) rather than the one with more votes and delegates (Hillary)."
8650,Welcome aboard!!!! Thanks for your vote üëç
8651,"Well it should mean something to you and give you pleasure if you have a strong personal support for Joe Biden - it gives him a better chance of becoming a president. Joe said some things that people supporting his own party still attack him for, let's show them we have the greatest desire of being united under common principles. All of the candidates (yes, even Bernie) have something questionable in their records, something that can be dug up and turned against them, all have committed mistakes but in spite of that they all believe in our principles and policies and fought and fight and will fight for them."
8652,Oh yeah so calm he told that union worker that he'd smack his face...
8653,Never believe stuff like this.
8654,"She broke the law with her E-Mail server. It‚Äôs not the biggest deal, but it‚Äôs further evidence of her arrogance, elitism, and general dishonesty."
8655,"It's entirely true. The youth vote came out at the same levels they have in past primaries and Bernie won this group by a large margin. They did not come out at increased levels which he was counting on. The rest of your statement just describes how there are fewer Bernie supporters than Biden supporters, but says nothing about their relative likelihood of voting. That's why Biden is winning, not because the Bernie supporters who exist aren't voting."
8656,"I‚Äôm a black voter and I distinctly remember Kamala being a front runner at one point but I must be mistaken. ü§îü§îü§î

Also last time I checked, white families hold 90% of the national wealth with Latino + black families holding less than 3% each. So both your points are completely moot."
8657,"You're not wrong, but it's still a better tool than blanket debt forgiveness. I'd love to see the dems push reforming these programs as part of their agenda, versus this BS regressive debt forgiveness."
8658,"#Woo Hoo!

Question: Why is only projected to get at least 16 out of 99 delegates? That doesn't sound like a lot."
8659,Gotta wait until then though
8660,Welcome!
8661,He does a better job of not picking fights with shower doors
8662,We really do need to get Ranked Choice voting spread further through the US.
8663,Yeah there's clips out there of both Biden and Obama praising Sanders as well on the same virtues.
8664,"Yang's endorsement looked very politically calculated, as well as contrary to Yang's policy preferences, and Yang himself implied that he had been offered something or led to believe he'd be offered something.  The transparency of such calculations, especially in contradiction to principle, is one main reason that this campaign struggles with younger voters who prize authenticity.

Regarding the op, I think what is sad is that as someone else said, this will absolutely be brought up in the general election.  Bernie Sanders himself is actually much easier on Biden than he could be.  But Trump's supporters won't let it go, and it will be used to show the hypocrisy of Democrats beyond Biden himself.

So if you really believe Biden is \*it\* it would make sense not to bury your head in the sand about this story, because anyone who actually listens to the first-hand account and reads the connections between Time's Up and Biden's campaign, sees that this is not a hit job made up by Bernie supporters."
8665,I'm of the mind that Biden is likely not simply picking a Vice President based on political expediency.
8666,It's a rally effect that won't last. Additionally it highlights Biden's crossover appeal in winning over Trump voters.
8667,"Isn‚Äôt this something special

I‚Äôm amazed that this came together 

I don‚Äôt know if it was someone‚Äôs idea, if it was orchestrated or if it just sprung up organically but we figured out how to beat the Russians, the populists and take the country back. Now it‚Äôs just time to kick ass."
8668,All of these old debates I see never have an audience. Is it just because they‚Äôre presidential debates? The audience on the debates these days is horrible and it would be so much better without them.
8669,"We are here to save America.  I freely admit that my household taxes will go up under Biden, and I'm willing to pay that extra burden so community college is free, and kids get out of cages."
8670,"The letters LGBTQ in the flair is in the wrong order.

I don't really know if it matters, but I'm hella OCD and its bothering me."
8671,I could see Mitt Romney endorsing Biden.
8672,"I like Bernie himself, he comes across as a genuine guy who truly does care about the best interest of others. But his supporters are so damn stubborn and narrow-minded that they are completely insufferable."
8673,"I‚Äôm not going to prove something to you that you refuse to accept. I listen to smart women and what they have to say about this, not you. And I‚Äôm better off for that. Good day."
8674,I still love Pete but I am pulling for Biden ...gosh a Biden president with Pete as veep would be the best.
8675,"Biden was friends with strom thurmond, james eastland, herman talmadge and many other racists. But it‚Äôs nice of you to show tour true colors and attack a civil rights leader. I bet you would have been attacking democratic socialist MLK if he was still alive."
8676,That's an...interesting post history they've got there.
8677,"I'm sure that someone can give a more detailed response in regards to specific policy as I am about to go to bed, but the long and short of it is that Biden IS a very progressive candidate. His policies are further to the left than any president we've had so far, and he will bring about good change for this country. I get that he's not 100% of what you want, but if elected, I dont doubt that he will pave the way for an even more progressive candidate to run in 2024, as people may be more ready for something like that. 

Historically, America has always followed a gradual slide to the left of the political spectrum. But that change must be gradual or else it will fuel divisiveness. Personally, my views more closely align with Bernie too. But Biden is the best shot we have at uniting the party and in convincing independents and future former Republicans that Trump isn't the answer, and that we must make progress on more progressive policies."
8678,Kamala Harris is awful though
8679,"All of this you're saying here is true.  It's just that your original comment is not correct:

&gt;If trump is re-elected you won‚Äôt see any progressive legislation passed for decades regardless of who eventually goes in the White House."
8680,"That‚Äôs great. Once a bigot, racist, homophobe always a bigot, racist, homophobe. No malarkey in my book."
8681,Brutal
8682,That‚Äôs good news!
8683,They‚Äôd really be barking up the wrong tree.
8684,When did we get overrun with trolls and bots?
8685,"We absolutely have to flip the Senate.  We have to keep the [the eleven Democratic seats that are up](https://www.270towin.com/2020-senate-election/), go after four tossups, and try to flip some leaning Republican seats.  Kansas will be one to watch.  Pat Roberts is retiring.  If Kris Kobach wins the GOP nomination, I think the Democratic candidate, Barbara Bollier, has a shot.  She‚Äôs a recent party changer, but she‚Äôs a moderate state senator in favor of Medicaid expansion.  We flipped a House seat in 2018 and have a shot at another, so hopefully we can flip a Senate seat too!"

8691,"Hillary was ahead by more at this stage, and Bernie didn't stop then either.  Its nearly impossible to force him out of the race without pissing off his following. Unless Bernie shows some actual leadership, expect decent numbers of his followers to stay home."
8692,"Wow great to see a biden supporter adopting the ROTR!

Glad to see biden bros are policing their own and not being hypocrites :)

Fuck the bros let's go üíéjoe"
8693,"Aw cool! I love downvotes! Hey while you‚Äôre all here maybe you can tell me why, if Biden loves black people so much, he put so many of them in jail? Is it so he always knows where they are in case he wants to visit? Haha just kidding don‚Äôt answer that! I‚Äôm asking rhetorically! We all know he‚Äôs for sure not saying the N word in his head when he‚Äôs talking about Thugs! He‚Äôs too RESPECTFUL to be racist!

8694,You go to some ultra dumb parts of the internet my friend.
8695,Bernie needs to follow.
8696,"Honestly, IMHO coronavirus is a fatal blow to Trump.

The pandemic will be an economic disaster for months to come, and it's the worst thing that could happen to any incumbent, but especially Trump's incompetent and dysfunctional administration. A surging stock market was literally the only positive ""accomplishment"" that Trump could point to, and that's all gone. This feels a lot like 2008."
8697,"I‚Äôve been on it for a while. My first mission is the removal of Trump. My second is the removal of Collins. She is truly the absolute worst. 

I‚Äôd be thrilled to contribute to weekly monetary pushes, content creation assistance, hell a bake sale, lol!"
8698,Thank you for being so welcoming!
8699,"Damn, I'm feeling bad for Warren.

She would be a great president, but after pretty much doing everything right politics wise for a while, her campaign strategy was just terrible.

She never realized she was competing with Bernie for the same pool of voters. Her strategy was just inexplicable really."
8700,Also note that past Primaries the last person to drop out has usually been May or June.

8704,"This is a fair point. I think general election strategy can afford to be more divisive than primary election strategy, and that there is a difference between hammering Trump for outright lying from the oval office, for using the power of his office to extort foreign governments to act against his political opponents, and distorting the facts to sully the reputation of other Democrats who you agree with on 90% of the issues. You need those Democrats after it is over to get your agenda done, and they aren't going to be there for you if you cost them every bit of political good will they have. 

That said, I think it is more important to beat Trump on a policy level than it is to attack his character. I guarantee most of his base think he's a disgusting human-being by now, they've just rationalized what he is personally with what they think his policies are/what they are doing for people. We have to hammer him on trade, on healthcare, on entitlements, on the deficit, and a dozen other very real issues. If the benefits aren't there, there is nothing to rationalize anymore."

8720,"Not trying to start an argument. I don‚Äôt think that saying healthcare is a human right and the government is responsible for delivering that instead of letting the people get price gouged by insurance companies is full on Marxist. The hospitals would be able to remain private as well as every other part of the apparatus, but they would just send the bill to a central location instead of having different people be eligible for varying degrees of service and having to haggle with different insurance companies. Insurance companies basically force people to gamble on their chances of needing care or not, that is not right. But saying that a single payer system is Marxist is a little crazy. This plan is not the same as the proletariat seizing the means of production. It‚Äôs extending what the government should provide its citizens. Same with feee college. Any argument against free college should be applied to getting rid of k-12 education in favor of exclusively having private schools. That idea sounds insane to me.

8742,"I believe we say that Biden isn't progressive enough, and you nailed it, the carbon tax does nothing other than put a band aid on a bleeding wound. It is simply not enough, and there needs to be a fundamental change in how carbon pricing functions. Today's youth are already prepared to go all in on renewable energy now, and we're already on the cusp of a golden age of ways to research and develop that. That means that carbon tax would be an unnecessary policy if we can push for renewable energy in 10 or even 15 years at most, because 30 years is not going to be kind to us. 

Bernie and I are against building new nuclear sites, I know a few engineers from those power plants and the industry is a dying one, and not only that but we need to address the large amount of nuclear waste rather than creating more. Construction of a new plant takes years and the by the time it begins to create electricity, we could already have develop renewable energy plants instead.

8748,"Here's a twitter thread with the author explaining this very simply like a week ago:

https://twitter.com/michaelharriot/status/1235747743005642753

&gt;I've talked to TOO MANY black Southern voters this week (and during my life) I wanna stop and explain the concept of ""the establishment"" to some people and why a lot of black Southern voters will NEVER vote for Bernie.

&gt;In a lot of small towns in the South, black people are generally on their own. There is no outside help. Activists, people on the ground doing work, and local political leaders all come from the same pot. There is no real distinction.

&gt;My piano teacher growing up was also the NAACP president who was also a city councilperson. Sometimes I had to wait for her to finish with someone who was harassed by the cops. Sometimes there was a meeting about a local restaurant who wouldn't serve black teens.

If it was a voting day, I had to miss a lesson because she had to work the polls.  Shortly after Mike Brown was killed, I went to Ferguson. As soon as I to Florissant Rd. folks asked me to help unload a truck filled with food, water, etc. where people could come and get it.

&gt;Again, there ain't no help for black people EXCEPT black people. Look at photos of protests for Trayvon Martin in Fla. or EJ Bradford Jr. in Birmingham or Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge. Those well-meaning, progressive white liberals are nowhere to be found.

&gt;All we have is the institutions, organizations and relationships we built. That's why politicians come to black churches in the south. That's why a lot of activists down here are also educators and religious leaders. It's why Dem. Party meetings take place in church basements.

&gt;That is quite literally ""the establishment"" for us. Unlike someone who live in blue and progressive areas, their lives depend on politics. It's why I've found black Southern black voters are more educated on the issues than any other group.

&gt;Admittedly, that comes with cynicism. 
Here is an example: 1 woman told me that Bernie is  too ""obsessed"" with M4A. She believes he'll sell anything out to get it done. Then she shocked the f*ck out of me by explaining something I had never heard of.

&gt;She explained that she had read Bernie's M4A plan and didn't like it because it would essentially eliminate private insurance. And, she said, negotiating prescription drugs removed financial incentives for innovating. Turns out, she was retired from a medical company

&gt;And many of them have the same criticism of Bernie Sanders:

&gt;""He ain't no Democrat.""

&gt;And they're right. He has not only criticized the party (God knows I have) but he has denigrated ""the establishment"" and distanced himself from people like Jim Clyburn and John Lewis."

There's no way a fully functioning society can reward those don't work hard or think ahead while hamstringing the successful and those who are economical in their lifestyles to pay off their debts.

8802,"I hope it's okay if I would drop the perspective from a foreigner here (born in 1995 in Germany and living there) who really cares about the trajectory of the partnership between the United States and Europe, especially Germany.

I think this election is in part about restoring the respect the world has for the United States. We know that there is a huge opposition to President Trump in the United States. We know that the American people are more than their President. We know that the transatlantic friendship is stronger than the Trump presidency.

But..! The Trump government is a laughing stock to the world. I am quite frank here. I give an example: Only 13 percent of the German people have a favourable view on Donald Trump. Just a comparison: In his last full year in office, 2016, a whopping 86 percent of the German people had a favourable view on President Barack Obama. 

How you vote matters on the international stage. That's why, every four years, the people in Germany watch what happens in the United States quite eagerly. 

Joe Biden is not only a respected statesman, he will strengthen the ties the United States has with its meaningful allies in Europe, in the NATO and in other parts of the world. And he will contribute in regaining respect for the government of the United States abroad. Joe Biden's political experience and knowledge of foreign policy is currently unparalleled in U.S. politics. His profile in foreign policy was a huge reason Barack Obama chose Joe Biden as his running mate. 

We live in a world of an increasing interdependence of countries in this world. And I think that it speaks volumes about Donald Trump that he cancelled a state visit in Denmark just because the Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen didn't want to negotiate with him about buying Greenland. Someone who burns diplomatic bridges just because he has some serious anger management issues is unfit to be President of the United States and unfit to be the Commander-in-Chief of the biggest army this planet has ever seen.

And it speaks volumes about the current President of the United States that I, a foreigner, can articulate a coherent string of arguments and full sentences in English (that is not my mother tongue) that the current President of the United States isn't capable of delivering (whose mother tongue is English).

So if it comes down to the general election and Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee I would like to urge you to vote for Joe Biden."

8828,"Ok honest question, is that good political calculus? She might help unite the progressive wing of the party behind Biden, but does that matter more than uniting the Midwest or sunbelt behind him?

I know it‚Äôs an opportunistic question, but I do really want to see Warren in a position of power. The thought of Biden bringing Pete, Elizabeth, and Beto into the new administration makes me salivate."
8829,thanks for pointing out my mistake.
8830,The reality is that Bernie has no desire to unify the party...so I don‚Äôt see how any realistic assessment of the situation has the Democratic Party uniting behind him.

But we need to keep sight of what is most important, beating Trump.  The Wisconsin poll out today only has Buttigieg beating Trump in a general.  He helps win the rust belt which is the cornerstone of Democrats beating Trump in the fall.  I think Stacey Abrams would be a great VP or President but I don‚Äôt know if she helps you win WI, PA, or MI. I don‚Äôt know if any candidate male or female, white or black that helps you win in the Midwest other than Pete.

8836,"COURTS! Make it all about the courts. 

As far as Joe's policies you can focus on:

$15 minimum wage

Expunging pot convictions and decriminalizing pot (we can push him from decriminalization to legalization...and I know a lot of socialist won't like it but the easiest way to push it to the public is to sell it as a money making thing). 

Abolishing the Death Penalty

the SAFE act

Iran Deal (point out Joe was part of the administration that got it done, and therefore may have an easier time getting back in it because of established connections).

There's more...but those are the easiest ones to sell people on. And again, I'd focus on the courts...I'd campaign for Joe freaking Manchin if he was the nominee because of the courts."

8838,"I'm skeptical of just about anything coming out of the Washington Examiner. Also you don't throw away free coverage of you speaking from 4 different networks if you have any serious intention of fighting on. Instead of getting out there and rallying his supporters, he's left them to  ruminate on the defeat. That alone is causing him to hemorrhage support. I'm pretty sure he's done in the next couple of days, and if he's not, this is an absolutely horrendous strategic move on his campaign's part."
8839,"Seems like he's trying to give Joe a chance to explain his plans so that Bernie can drop out, saying he's satisfied with Joe's answers.

8844,"Because at this point it‚Äôs just highlighting how disconnected with reality many Bernie supporters are in my opinion. Rather than looking at reality for what it is, you‚Äôre very content to live in a little bubble where everyone in the media and every pollster in the country is lying to you because that makes it easier to convince yourselves Bernie still has a chance. 

Which is fine, okay, live in the bubble if it makes you happy. The problem is many of the supporters are so delusional that they will begin attacking Biden more and more viciously, working themselves into a frenzy of ‚Äúif we can show the American people these awful, edited clips, everyone will realize how bad he actually is!‚Äù

The problem is, the attacks are just going to become more and more vicious while all of you continue to deny the reality that Biden is the nominee, to the point where you all actually have to face that reality, it‚Äôs going to result in some serious mental breakdowns. And even then, you‚Äôre not going to blame yourselves, oh no, it‚Äôs all Biden‚Äôs fault, or it‚Äôs all old people‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs all because of this or that.

Sanders supporters have a collective disassociation with reality. It‚Äôs best to just deal with the truth now rather that later, it‚Äôll be less painful that way."

8859,They‚Äôre a hot mess on twitter.
8860,Bernie's voters have clearly demonstrated that they are unreliable it would actually make more sense to tack to the right and court the very reliable  GOP leaning voters. The hard core Bernie zealots aren't going to vote anyway. Bernie is against party unity. Bernie has basically warped the minds of a bunch of young people and it may not be worth the effort to reel them back in.
8861,Trump won Wisconsin by less than a percent. I think it‚Äôs definitely a possibility.

8872,"Oh I've noticed. I remember back in 2008, even though Obama was consistently up by close to 10 points over McCain for the entire election that the media kept saying the election was ""a tie"". On election night, MSNBC's analysts for the first hour were saying that it was looking like the night was going to shape up to be a lot like 2004 and that it was going to be a lot closer than people were thinking. Of course McCain was blown out of the water by Obama and the election was called as soon as California's polls closed. Biden could be 80 points ahead of Trump and they would still say it's too close to call."
8873,"This is kinda cherrypicking since we are experiencing a prolonged disaster... but even so, I think it's better to note that Obama inherited a recession and fixed it and made sure it didn't happen again for 10 years. Trump inherited a great economy, and made it better by slashing important regulations and deficit spending out the ass"

&gt;Cannabis may cause [schizophrenia symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/schizophrenia-symptoms) to start earlier in life, too.

Pennsylvania had the greatest vote differential but also swung back to the Left in 2018. Wisconsin has been moving farther right recently and the Gubernatorial election was very close two years ago. If you want to for sure secure the state Tammy Baldwin would be the prime choice.  
  
But picking based on securing a state is not always the smartest play IMO. Kaine was basically that pick in 2016 and look how that turned out. I think there needs to be a pick that will excite the base and I'm not sure if Baldwin's the answer for that."
8904,"We could have had a younger nominee...but people weren't interested. Not trying to knock Joe too much, I support him and voted for him, but I still don't understand why something like this happening was never a consideration for people."

And I am praying for voters today to be motivated to vote resoundingly for a hopeful future of a country united to heal the divides, restore broken institutions and uplift lives. 

May Joe's victory today be decisive and conclusive.

8911,"You know I‚Äôm fine with Bernie going on because he want to spread his message through the debate. It‚Äôs one more week and I don‚Äôt really think it does anything but gives Biden a chance to speak to the American people.

But with numbers like we have I really wish some of the progressive media would stop feeding into the ‚Äúfight to the end‚Äù and ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how Bernie can win‚Äù narrative, because there are people who will sit in an echo chamber and send Bernie hundreds of dollars under the belief there‚Äôs an actual chance.

8918,"Right now #byebyebernie is trending on Twitter. I've seen an incredible amount of nastiness from Biden supporters along the way, especially since Super Tuesday onward. The majority opinon has always been that ""Bernie bros"" are toxic trash, akin to Trump supporters, and that's just the base-level contempt from a lot of folks. 

That said, a reversal in online tone is not what Bernie supporters are concerned with. If Joe wants people to vote for him, there needs to be policy concessions. Thus far, I've seen no reason to believe Joe is interested in reaching out to the progressive wing of the party, or even thinks he should."
8919,"I draw the line at actual unwanted physical contact which doesn‚Äôt seem like a crazy place to draw a line. I also disagree that Bernie is dismissive of women. Strictly policy related, I think we have two different ideas of what a progressive agenda is. Off the top of my head Biden isn‚Äôt touching the existing student loan crisis in any meaningful way, has no plan for child care, has no plans to legalize marijuana, I can barely find anything about paid family leave from him. These are big boxes unchecked for progressives. And I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve missed some. it‚Äôs obviously fine if he has no plan or is against those items.

This tells me that Biden isn't looking to be the King of All, but a leader of a talented TEAM, and he's willing and happy to surround himself with good people with whom he happily shares credit.     A stark contrast to the populist cult of personality technique that dominates the Trump administration and...let's just say ""other campaigns."""

Sort of a stupid thing to argue about, we will see what happens in June, but the point stands barring some sort of epic scandal or other devastating event from Hickenlooper he is definitely going to win, and the one piece of evidence you have to counter that is possibly the most worthless piece of evidence you could produce."

I believe it‚Äôs easier to work within the existing framework to make healthcare available to everyone, although of course I want to always be looking at ways of improving healthcare availability. I know the limitations of executive order to overhaul existing systems."

8974,"Sorry she's out.  She was my second after Pete, it's hard to see someone you supported for a year or more to drop out.  Hang in there, one way or another our ultimate goal is to beat Trump and take our country back to a better place."
8975,"You joke, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did!

8977,I also honestly don't think she would help in Florida as much as people assume. She's not exactly a widely known local celebrity or anything and a lot of Floridians are going to not even know she's a Floridian.
8978,"They're both going to be within 3% I think, but he has a better shot in PA. Also from what I understand, his fracking comments referred to not allowing it in the future on public lands. Not something that really applies to PA's economy all that much."
8979,"""BS grandstands"" Grandstand? Oh you mean hold his ground on issues that he's passionate about?

""Biden gets stuff done"" Yeah, for the establishment.

""In 30 years in Washington, BS us shown that he doesn‚Äôt know how to get things done."" Yup, because he's forced to work with establishment hacks like Hillary Clinton. 

If I didn't know better, I'd think I was on ""The Donald"" circa 2016"

8988,"Healthcare outline

Provide a full, universal public option, if you are not already insured you are automatically insured in the public plan

The plan is free for those making less than 138 the federal poverty line, for everyone else it is a maximum of 8.5% of your income (today the average American spends about 15% of their wages on healthcare)

Price control on drugs like insulin

Allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices"
8989,"I don‚Äôt think Biden will likely lose without independents. He has such a strong base in the black and suburban vote that his coalition is realistically able to rival trumps. Not saying that progressives aren‚Äôt important to listen to and understand their policy demands, but it‚Äôs definitely not as cut and dry as Bernie Bros make it to be that only Bernie has a chance of taking down trump, it‚Äôs just patently untrue"

8991,If you‚Äôre a student then you were listed as a dependent on someone else‚Äôs taxes and will get a little money that way. I hope they boost the benefits for people on unemployment for sure.
8992,Thanks everyone. I‚Äôll be voting for Bernie.
8993,"First, I thank you for doing what too many refuse to do, and that‚Äôs keep an open mind. Second, I would ask you to consider that many of your views of Joe have been shaped by the narratives manufactured by Bernie‚Äôs surrogates, and the overall ‚ÄúTYT‚Äù wing of the party. They need you to believe that everyone else is awful and impure so that you‚Äôll be loyal to whomever they espouse is the pure one. 

As for why you should vote for Joe, from an issue by issue basis, Joe, Bernie, and virtually every other Democrat are on the same side. Sure some take their proposals further than others, such as Bernie wanting M4A and Joe wanting major ACA fixes and a public option that covers almost all Americans. In the end though it‚Äôs safe to say both Bernie and Joe want high quality, affordable healthcare for all. They both affirm the fact of climate change. They both support marriage equality, and a woman‚Äôs right to choose. They believe in gun control and immigration reform that treats refugees with the human dignity they deserve. All the way down the line I think you‚Äôll find Bernie and Joe align in closer ways than you think. 

On a personal side, I find Joe to be deeply compassionate, empathetic, optimistic, and possesses the wisdom and steady hand we need right now to steer the ship of state. He exudes the spirit and heart of America and a belief in unity and brotherhood. 

Now is the time for us all to stand shoulder to shoulder against Trump and the moral, ethical, and Constitutional armageddon he represents. We need to be Joe‚Äôs champions and defenders. His sword and his shield. We do this not just because Joe is a great guy and Trump is a pile of shit, but more importantly because of the babies in cages, and RBG, and the continued existence of rights that we‚Äôve always taken for granted, but could be gone in a day in a 2nd Trump term. This election is about things far greater than us and our personal interests. This election is existential and a final judgement on the character of the nation."
8994,"They are fairly accurate for that timeline, Bernie still beats Trump nationally, as does Joe. But that's just popular vote. Electoral voting circumstances are different and no one can predict who is in a better shape at this point.

And there will be many ups and downs throughout the campaign season, polls numbers will swing up and down. It's too early to put your money on anybody or count anyone out.

The only thing you can count on is it'll be a hard fought election."
8995,It's also hard for Russians to vote.
8996,"She just changed her story from Biden making her feel uncomfortable by touching her shoulders to ""he actually raped me"". 

If you see Trump's accusers, they had consistent stories, contemporaneous witnesses and showed a clear pattern of behaviour from the accuser. In this case they are taking Biden's behaviour of being too huggy to a full-blown rapist which is several bridges too far."
8997,"Biden won big in a democratic primary, not a general election. That promise of gun control died quickly when moderate/vulnerable Dems sided with the 2A crowd. Read the Dem postmortem on the 2016 election, gun control hurt the Democrats in the swing states."
8998,that's flair waiting to happen
8999,"Welcome aboard friendo. I've always liked Andrew Yang as a person, even though I don't agree with UBI. I do hope Biden gives him a position in his administration suited to his talents."
9000,"Bernie has been using his platform to raise money for COVID-19 charities as of late, and staying critical of Trump. I wholly support him in his efforts here, and if that‚Äôs what he wants to use his campaign for now, then more power to him. He‚Äôs stopped the attacks, he‚Äôs stopped campaigning, he‚Äôs stopped advertising. He knows it‚Äôs over, and now he‚Äôs using his revolution to help others. Personally, I like that."

9002,"Gaming, Netflix, Pornhub and alcohol sales are going to do great and pollution will be down."
9003,"I'm not American and this is not meant to be rude or an attack. Does it really not take more than an empathetic 10 min clip of someone you didn't know anything about to get you to consider voting for them? Will you look at policy later on? If so, how do you make sure your judgement isn't clouded by personal affection?"
9004,"Me 10.   Abrams should have ran for one of the Ga  senate seats.  She is not ready to be president and thus not a good VP choice.  Her popularity could have helped turn one of those red seats blue....  so desperately needed and a much greater impact IMO for her than being a running mate.   VP of course is more prestigious but its not her time.

And I supported her in the gov race, attended one her rallies where Kamala Harris was the guest speaker."
9005,"guys, I would really be careful about bernie-bashing on this sub right now. now that Biden's all but clinched the nomination there's going to be an influx of his supporters here, and we want to make them feel welcomed - not defensive."
9006,So he's still an asshole. Not really news.
9007,Is there any talk of a tax credit for people who may have just paid a bunch of theres off?
9008,"I'm super keen on her either. I just think that there are demographic advantages to having her on the ticket. I'd definitely prefer Pete, I just think it's less likely to happen. Women were a big part of taking the house back and whether it's justified or not, there are some bad optics which can be exploited regarding Biden and women. Obviously it's nothing compared to Trump, but a line of attack doesn't have to convert voters but rather only has to reduce enthusiasm to be effective. Having a female VP on the ticket goes a long way to preventing that."
9009,"""Compared to the civil war?"" That's a bad comparison my friend.."
9010,"Thank you. Still so sad that Pete dropped out. 
But also very proud of our campaign."

It's a good reminder that twitter and reddit are not real life... but still I wonder if theres ways to grow this community and how the campaign could pay more attention to doing this.
9015,Clinton wasn't saying she was a Russian asset. She said the Republicans were grooming her for a third-party run.
9016,Welcome aboard. The thing I like about Joe is he doesn't require you to stop liking Bernie to vote for him. Lets get Democrats into office so we can get back on track passing progressive policies!
9017,Thanks
9018,I feel like they just amplify it....   the division is already there. They‚Äôre not creating it.
9019,"Lol him rejecting racism and bigotry doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt want // isn‚Äôt okay with having former trump voters support him- you actually can‚Äôt be serious. 

Find me a clip of saying republicans are racist,  terrible people. 

Find me a clip of Joe saying he doesn‚Äôt want republicans to support him. 

Look- you‚Äôre clearly a troll and I don‚Äôt like wasting my time with trolls.

It was ushered-in by President Nixon. That becomes a means, albeit a superficial one, through which bipartisan consensus is possible on Federal Indian Policy.

I think in 10 years, Yang's approach will be obvious. But it works best in a prosperous, educated creative society that has moved into a post-capitalist society where machines have replaced the mundane, do we can subsidize the creative. That is not America yet. Hopefully with free trade school, free public college for low income people, refinanced student loans, increased research and development and good trade deals we will be there."

9037,"I also had a falling out with a friend / acquaintance which involved him saying that a voting for anyone but Bernie / Warren is morally repugnant. I don't think they realize that you can have legitimate reasons for supporting Biden from a purely progressive stance (ie: higher odds of winning vs Trump, stronger Democrat turnout downballot to flip Senate + keep House, ability to actually enact change, etc)"
9038,How can you unite the party after holding them hostage?
9039,"Hi guys. I‚Äôm new here. I was a big supporter of Pete. Curious about Joes healthcare plans and student loans/college plan. Those two things are the biggest factors for me. I will be turning 26 next year (fall 2021) and will have to get off of my step-dads insurance. Also, I am currently in graduate school for social work and will have roughly 30,000 in debt.

That case dealt basically with just who is selected to go to Washington for the formal process.

Also, Tribe isn't exactly a reliable source on these issues; he's basically got a case of Trump Derangement Syndrome and has been called out for spreading unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. Even he owns up to it in his Twitter bio: ""Just a VERY angry citizen on Twitter. Opinions are my own. Sometimes prone to crazy assertions. Not a fan of this nepotistic kleptocracy."""

9052,"Montana‚Äôs partisan lean is too far Republican for this to be anything but hurtful. The way we win the senate seat in Montana is by making it only a referendum on a highly popular governor.

The best thing we can do for Bullock, ironically, is pretend he doesn‚Äôt exist and just let him essentially campaign as an independent."

9062,"Yes. It's amazing how there are Bernie supporters trying to claim that Warren not dropping out caused Bernie to lose states/underperform when Bloomberg's presence likely had an equal if not greater effect on the moderate vote for Biden. Joe is going to get most if not all of Bloomberg's support, and if he'd had it tonite, even if Bernie had Liz's, Joe's margins would probably just have been even bigger. He might've lost MA, but he'd be running up the score in TX and other states and have been far more competitive in CA.  Outside of her home state, Warren seems to have had roughly half of Bloomberg's support, so it seems rather delusional to think that her voters going over to Bernie would swing the big picture in his favor, unless we're entertaining a fantasy where she drops out but Mike doesn't. This is coming from someone perfectly happy to vote Joe in the general but whose first choice was Warren, then Bernie."

That being said, things changed even more and fairly recently, impeachment and then the covid-19 crisis... Holy shit, Mitt Romney already has a ""good and very honorable and courageous man who just happens to be conservative so we have to disagree on anything anyway"" label in my book after his impeachment vote, if he did as much as an actual endorsement of Biden he would become a legend in reaching across the isle. This is so unlikely i do not even want to allow myself to consider that not to be disappointed, but now it is too late, i'm excited."

I'm a middle aged woman and contrary to the fake news that only young people support Bernie, there are large numbers of middle aged and old people that are Bernie voters too. So you all can't win without us and this is the election when enough of a majority of us will not be voting for the phony Dem Biden whom the establishment rigged the election for and Dems will once again lose to Trump. You all can't win without us in this election or future elections so you better find a true Dem to run in the future because otherwise we'll be starting our own party."

There are many things he can do. And on Twitter and Reddit, the face of his supporters are vile and divisive. Every other campaign is giving Pete supporters time. Bernie supporters are urging people to search for hurting Pete fans and poach them - after ""deleting their comment history of rat emojis"".

If you are not with Bernie, then you hate the poor, hate the working class, and need to be reprogrammed. This is the prevalent attitude of Sanders supporters, and why they have lost my vote."

Amy, Kamala and Elizabeth have quite the baggage. Stacey Abrams has the loss of the 2018 Georgia governor election for Trump also use. Plus, she compliments Biden's strength (black voters) yet does not to patch Biden's weakness.

We might think the VP needs to outshine Biden, but the DNC may not want that to happen.

I think the DNC will pick the safest choice that ticks the POC and progressive voters.

Has Biden proposed any form of support for a public option, or something similar to the Affordable Care Act? Obamacare was a huge step in the right direction, in my opinion.

As for Marijuana, I've been a habitual smoker ever since beating cancer and have no intention on quitting. I have a bad back now as result of my struggles and marijuana helps me manage it immensely. This being said, I would love to have it legalized soon!"

Legalizing the ""devils weed"" isn't a good idea with older voters and it just might be a small detail, but it's important. We need all the voters we can gather and the older group of voters are the biggest and largest group.

If you piss them off, they don't vote, you lose. Or they vote republican and you also lose.

living in Northern MN, broke, no goverment support, no medical, crop failures, no electricity, eating the horses etc....

things are going to be hard but not that hard."
9111,"He may not be able to stand up to trump as well in The debates, but his ideas actually make sense and just seem more realistic than bernie‚Äôs. and a lot of his supporters are former klob/buttigieg supporters (like me). I‚Äôd take sanders over trump any day, but opportunity given I‚Äôd much rather have Biden as president"

9115,Brah what‚Äôs with the ordering
9116,"CBS - Biden has reached 1,000 delegates. 

***HIGHER AND HIGHER!***

In fact, we've gone higher. 

Google has Joe at over 1,100 delegates. 

***HIGHER AND HIGHER!***"
9117,"Okay - thanks for sharing the website. I really do hope that key midwestern States break for Joe. Joe and the Party need to make a strong commitment by focusing on issues that matter most to them and further the progressive vision - basically walk and chew gum at the same time.

I personally feel pretty decent about AZ. We have a recognizable candidate in Mark Kelly and AZ has shown purple to light blue tinge in recent elections.

Despite the calamity that we are facing right now, I feel bit better about Joe's chance everyday."
9118,"I‚Äôm the child of two educators.  Teachers are great.  I‚Äôm talking about the NEA.  NRA, NEA, both hurt America."
9119,"The first thing you may want to do is get excited your self. Trying to outright convince people never works.  Instead they will take the queue from your excitement and hopefully have a change of heart by November.  

Second, just give it a few weeks, or until Bernie is out then wait a bit more. I understand the pain of watching a well loved candidate lose, (I voted Pete before he dropped). 

And no matter what, remember you are always welcomed here and once things simmer down conversations will be able to flourish! 

Thank you for taking the time and interest in Biden! 

\-Blue no matter who."
9120,"&gt;They are voting against their best interests, so are MAGA chuds, thinking THE MEXICANS while getting assblasted by your capitalist overlords lmao

chapos not even trying to hide it"
9121,"Think past today, past today is the win. FL, PA, OH and NY. Even MO.

:)'s. 

Relax and breath."
9122,They‚Äôre anti-choice women. Simple.
9123,I‚Äôm gonna pick up some ice cream on the way home from work for my dad and I when we watch the results come in; we‚Äôre both ridin with Biden üòéüíéüç¶
9124,"ah yes debating about topics is being divisive

wut"
9125,Based on your history- you‚Äôre trolling. This is against the rules.
9126,"Pete probably wouldn‚Äôt win that race unfortunately and I don‚Äôt think the legislative branch is the best fit for his abilities. He‚Äôs better suited to executive leadership and foreign policy work. As for the take down by Kamala, it‚Äôs clearly water under the bridge between her and Joe and didn‚Äôt have any affect on how things turned out so I‚Äôm willing to forgive her for that."
9127,Shut up nigger
9128,"Joe is still largely bound by corporatism which is why his healthcare and climate change policies aren‚Äôt nearly as aggressive as they should be. If you look at his history in the senate throughout all the decades he was there, it‚Äôs not surprising that a big chunk of Sanders supporters don‚Äôt trust him. I would rather fight like hell for a blue congress but vote green or some other 3rd party in the general at this point. I would be fine with a trump presidency with a blue house and senate than 4 or 12 more years of neoliberalism"
9129,"It's almost a scam.   Send me $20 and I'll get your college debt paid off or give you free Health Care.  When he falls short it will because his supporters didn't do enough and the establishment stopped him. 

Never him."
9130,Many minority voters don't want to see an all white ticket. That and I think Warren would be more effective in a the senate.
9131,"So does a significant portion of the Latin American community actually advocate for the term Latinx?  I'm seriously asking.  It seems like the only people I've heard talk about it are white people trying to show how woke they are.  That being said, if the Latin American community genuinely wants to be addressed as Latinx, I'm all for it."
9132,Sounds like things worked out about right.
9133,Do you have any of those examples saved? I've seen rude people on politics but thats mostly bots and astroturf.
9134,"No he is helping joe's chances. The fact is the scratch game has been scratched and bernie didn't get the winning numbers, tell them to sit down and move on"
9135,"They should have to change the mod staff or rename the sub

As is its a disinformation echo chamber and a disservice to a democratic nation, while dressed in the name of general ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù. 

Ill sign anything u put in front of me to the effect"
9136,"California allows you to bring in your ballot and request a new one if you fill it out but then want to change what you did initially

They don't let you change it after you submit it though unfortunately"
9137,"*sigh*

Val Demings, while at the same time checking off so many of the boxes Senator Harris does, is such a stronger VP pick. 

I would be really disappointed if it was Kamala. Her supporters were, generally speaking, some of the most toxic people I interacted with during the primary season. On top of that, she definitely has some skeletons in her closet as California AG, and attacks on her would be widespread and powerful."
9138,This is that real ishhhh! Can I have it plz?
9139,"Sanders has done better with states that elect by caucuses, and Biden has done better with states that elect by primaries

Candidates that do better in caucuses generally [require a small but fervent group of supporters](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/03/2020-elections-caucuses-democrats-primaries-bernie-sanders-1078031) who are willing to take hours to debate and cast their vote. Candidates that do better with primaries need more broad appeal.

The general election more closely resembles how primaries are held."
9140,"I'm mentally preparing a fat Facebook post for my progressive pals who think Biden is ""basically a Republican"" and ""nothing will change if Biden is elected."" Once Bernie's been out a few days, I'll try it.

Linking specific Biden policies to people on reddit saying he'll change nothing about that topic has become the majority of what I do on here lately. I try to pop on for gardening pics and cool 80's music, and end up cut and pasting Biden policies for 2 hours.

They seldom respond at all, but no news is good news? I hope they're at least reading it. It blows my mind that people are willing to type out declarative statements regarding a subject they know they haven't done basic research on, but then I remember who's President, and how. We have a new normal to combat here."
9141,"&gt;Even if it wouldn‚Äôt be effective until a couple of years it has to be better than paying ridiculous amounts for any health care? 

Because having reasonable healthcare quickly is far more important to the people that need it than having to wait around with our current inefficient system praying to God that Republicans don't kill it and send us back to square one in the long time it would take for it to become effective.

&gt;Also, I‚Äôm just a spectator from Norway, and I seriously can‚Äôt fathom how Bernie is not superior. I watched clips of Joe in the debates and he‚Äôs debating like a child. I‚Äôve also seen some compilations that plain out just makes him seem like a horrible guy with little focus on the people. 

Bernie is a terrible debater dude. His default strategy is to repeat his stump speech over and over again and anytime he's forced to answer difficult questions he looks like a deer in the headlights and tries to deflect back to the stump speech. 

Contrast with Joe Biden's engaging with individuals on their level face to face like in his CNN Townhall, or how he mostly parried and shut down Bernie in their one-on-one debate where Bernie desperately tried to paint Biden as corrupt, then immediately backed down once Biden brought up the skeletons in Bernie's own closet.

&gt;All the people I know here in Norway are supporting Bernie, and I struggle to see why Biden has any appeal over him. What makes you choose him over Bernie? 

Europe ain't America dude, and even beyond that having a bunch of pretty platitudes is no substitute for legislative experience, coalition building and sharp political skills. I trust Biden to be able to execute most of his policies, I trust Bernie to do what he's done most of his career, yell a lot as the opposition party but never actually get anything done."
9142,"That last paragraph was a rollercoaster. Are you still for Tulsi? Either way, i‚Äôm glad to see there are republicans out there that understand the current republican party is destroying fiscal conservatism"
9143,"Yeah I don't agree with him on (this part of) his  climate change policy, but he is waaaay better than trump on that issue.

Also, what is Biden's stance on nuclear? It was one of the things I liked about Yang a lot."
9144,She was underrated in my opinion
9145,"r/politics is such a misleading name because the people going there think they are getting ""fair and balanced"" news.....   its the kind of troll forum that got Trump elected"
9146,"Stuff we don't think it's worth putting any significant time, energy, or resources into changing."
9147,Did he explain why he voted against them having safe water?
9148,I think they want to but they can‚Äôt until Bernie bows out and Sanders wants to keep his million dollar operation running to help Trump until June.
9149,"One of the best young Governors in the country, and a future star of the party for sure."
9150,That would be wild
9151,"Military in Florida here, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, early voting started either yesterday, or starts today. At least in Duval."
9152,Don't accuse people of being Berners. Just stop with that.
9153,What? Teachers are not the problem. You‚Äôre the first person I‚Äôve heard trying to break up unions. Teachers are still so grossly underpaid.
9154,"Did you read the article? It's pretty clear.

This is the cash payment. It's not a tax credit. The House version was more generous to the poor and unemployed. The Senate version gives nothing to poor people."
9155,"I‚Äôm not aware of anything that specific, but I do know his plan to tackle the education debt problems includes a public service option as a way to pay it down at an accelerated rate."
9156,"Please explain which of Joe's issues those are ?

I feel like you might actually not know Joe's platform."
9157,"We've got one heck of a fight on for Missouri and Michigan. If anyone can do anything to help such as going to events, knocking on doors, or calling voters from the coziness of your own home...that would be hugely appreciated!"
9158,"https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1237537361191264257

&gt;Pretty straightforward story in Michigan: Biden doing better than Clinton just about everywhere. Won't be a race call until all the polls are closed, but at this rate it wouldn't surprise me if there wound up being enough for a call at that point"
9159,OK that would be epic.
9160,"Joe is gonna have one helluva administration, super stars galore."
9161,"After this, not a lot of big states left. NY, PA, now OH... But I don't see a big state of several big states left for Bernie 2 win.

Cali is over. TX is done, FL just went. 

I just don't see a path for him. Michigan, maybe?!? Not really.

Does Bernie play in NJ? Or New York?"
9162,"Get in partner, we‚Äôre on our way to stomping the Tramp."
9163,Nice! I actually saw conan was going to try and do that as well.
9164,"that is exactly what happened, the Rosenstein memo was an excuse. but it reflects the legal consensus that Comey screwed up."
9165,"This. \*Policy\* wise, I'm not only way closer to Bernie than Biden, I'm way closer to Bernie than \*Pete\*. I've just never even for a second believed Bernie could actually DO any of the things he wants to do, or pass any of the things he wants to pass. Pete could have. Biden can. 

Important life lesson that takes effect in many varied contexts: you can't ever let perfect become the enemy of the good. Was Pete a direct clone of my ideal political affiliation? Hell no. But he's a good man, and I believed and believe that in areas where we differed, it was in good faith and because he was doing what he believed was best in order to meet our shared goals. I have way more ground to make up with Biden, but I'm slowly beginning to get to that same point with him."
9166,"This article might be behind a paywall.

9167,"When the intention behind calling him Bernard isn‚Äôt genuine it hurts he reputation of this sub, regardless of Bernie‚Äôs relation to that name."
9168,"Depending on the state, there is a remedy, I \*think\*. You'd have to look it up, but I was reading yesterday where in some state(s) you can 'invalidate' your already-cast ballot and revote."
9169,barack obama
9170,"Yep. 538 had roughly the same, whereas a few days earlier it was polling heavily Sanders +17. Suggesting Beto had no effect is inaccurate at best."
9171,"The moderates have at the very least attempted to bring in the progressives by adopting some of their beliefs and ideas.

The progressives have just yelled at the moderates for not being progressive enough and refuse to combine their message.

It's not like Hillary didn't extend some love to Bernie and his people and it's not like Joe's got one of the most progressive platforms of all time.

It's just never enough for them."
9172,So does someone's fear of dying outweigh someone actually dying because that's what your statement sense to suggest to me?
9173,"When [Nate Silver abandons the primary forecast](https://twitter.com/natesilver538/status/1240113819508183051?s=21) citing that it's ""not competitive"" to instead work on the general election one and a coronavirus side project."
9174,"&gt; zoomer death cult

good band name..."
9175,"Not sure about Biden, but it wouldn't be explicitly his decision. The ICC is established by treaty, i.e. needs to be ratified by 2/3 of the Senate."
9176,"I think a major problem is there really aren't that many ""progressives"" at a big enough level to take over...or at least people considered progressives by Bernie people. And it really needs to be a woman...There's Barbara Lee (whom I love, but is way too old &amp; has a history of being pro Castro), Moore (again, age and looks ten years older than she is...), Tammy Baldwin, and that's...it. Jaypal was born in India, so she's out due to the constitution. Five years ago I would have said Brown, but Sherrod isn't for single payer. 

If Ayanna Pressely had a few more terms under her belt...she would have been a good choice...but even then high level Bernie people on his campaign (Brie, Sirota, Turner, etc.) are liking shitty tweets trashing Warren and people involved in Warren's campaign. Warren and Baldwin are a possibility, but the media backlash (and backlash from his supporters) would be severe if he didn't pick a WOC...and I'm not sure the pros outway the cons in that situation."
9177,OK keep lying and acting like someone is entitled to run for office without being asked about their past.
9178,"Uhh...there's about a dozen other things I'd blame the Clinton loss on before attacking Trump, but sure..."
9179,No idea. But you can tell quite a significant portion of the people are not Americans
9180,Raised $17-18 million in the month of February!
9181,"I somewhat doubt Pete for state. I have a feeling Biden would go with a state department lifer to get our international relationships back on track 

If not veep I see Pete in Energy or HUD"
9182,not sure is bernie bros or russians hmmmm
9183,"Very well, I wasn't aware of the ""asset"" part. But her initial statement was that Republicans were grooming her and that she was simply backed up by the Russians, that's what I was trying to say"

9186,I am curious not attacking but how do you feel Bernie is selfish? I honestly come in peace. I just want to get an impression of what things are like on your side of the fence
9187,Unity has been a theme of both their campaigns so I'm glad to see Yang endorse him. It made sense to wait until someone was the prohibitive favorite but it's a natural fit. Can't wait to see more of him in the future.
9188,Does anybody have a link to the speech? I missed it
9189,"I have been advocating for Bernie to drop out since I saw no conceivable path to the nomination. I've supported Sanders for a while, and the point is to provide a perspective from that view."
9190,Italy has it. It‚Äôs made no difference. Canada has it and already has what they call a ‚Äúhallway medicine‚Äù problem due to lack of resources. The grass is always greener in Michael Moore documentaries and Bernie speeches for obvious reasons. It‚Äôs spin. Quit politicizing a pandemic that requires the kind of emergency measure experience and planning that Joe Biden has and stop campaigning and putting people at risk unnecessarily. Improved health care is on the way with near universal coverage. It will pass and help people. M4all will not happen.
9191,A Russian Asset has endorsed Joe Biden.
9192,"Okay. Maybe I don‚Äôt know enough of the story, but what exactly did he do wrong in the Thomas confirmation hearings? He voted no on Thomas. The only thing I see that he might‚Äôve done wrong was give his Republican colleagues the opportunity to attack  Hill. If this is what everyone is pilloring him on, he and Senate Democrats has a history of being overtly bipartisan during that time. It‚Äôs a sign of weakness, which initially made me wary of Biden, but it doesn‚Äôt make him the monster the left portrays him to be."
9193,What a selfish move. Was he really that bitter to end it?
9194,Not in Florida!
9195,"What incentive do progressives have to vote for Joe if, rather than ""ultra conservative"" judges being put in by Trump, simply ""conservative"" judges are put in by Biden?"
9196,I‚Äôm a Sanders supporter as well and it is just politics. In a 2-man race going negative is just about the only way to gain ground when you‚Äôre down. I think it‚Äôs at least a positive/encouraging sign that it seems to only be happening ‚Äúlately‚Äù - I think it‚Äôs a testament to Bernie that it seems mostly out of character for him to go negative.
9197,"This is amazing,"
9198,"&gt;Biden will need to start building unity and how he tries to do this will be interesting.

I mean no disrespect, but you say this like he hasn't been doing this for weeks. Biden has made a strong effort to reach out to Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and Warren voters. I'm sure he'll do the same after Sanders concedes."
9199,It‚Äôs comedy at this point.
9200,Fair enough and I won't say anything bad about Senator Baldwin. She's got the qualifications too and I'll support her if that's who Biden chooses.
9201,"Welcome aboard and thanks for your vote. We hope to see you helping us campaign. While Louisiana always seems to trend red, we need people like you on our team to help unite us with all people everywhere."
9202,"Kamala.  From MN and like Amy.  However, she showed that she isn't a stong debater and hard to relate to.  The traditional role of the VP is to do the attack work.  Kamala has shown herself to be much better at that.  I also think she would be a strong personality to draw out black voters and suburban women."
9203,"What does that say about the Warren endorsement? She's ticked at Bernie and one best not scorn a woman. 

Warren's making the safe bet. Can't endorse Biden, won't endorse Sanders. But by not endorsing Sanders she's really endorsing Biden.

Now she can just wait till Sanders leaves and join the rest!"
9204,"This narrative about the 2016 election is a half truth. Trump benefitted from a splintered primary, and a message where he alleged solutions that weren't just tax cuts. Republicans were a party of ""no, not that"" and he started spouting off bullshit solutions to misidentified problems. Clinton could easily be the President right now if just one of several things had gone differently. First (and most important), was the hubris of thinking she had Michigan and Wisconsin safe enough to ignore them late while trying to flip red States. A little more time up north, and it's a different.outcome. Then you had Comey just outright sabatoge her a week before. Or if Sanders voters actually back her at the same rate Clinton's backed Obama. 

Fighting populism on the right with populism on the left is not the answer this country needs. There is no bridge building in that world, only burning. Pete's message of building on what we have in common to move our country forward is anathema to Bernie's revolution. The people sewing division from his campaign co-chair, to his surrogates, to his everyday supporters represent everything not ROTR. To the point where I can't understand someone who believes Pete's message, but would support Bernie's campaign this time around."
9205,zoomer gang
9206,"I thought it was a primary this year but still called a caucus? Does everyone have to show up at the same time and argue or are they voting secret ballot? 

If it‚Äôs secret ballot, I bet Joe pulls out a win."
9207,"Even as a very anti-Joe Yang supporter, his fiery moments never bothered me. I think they're blown out of proportion. The D nominee will have to argue against outright lies on the road, in debates, and during interviews. That's what I didn't like about Hillary, she didn't fight against his lies."
9208,I'm having sweats thinking about a tie
9209,Bought one of everything! Gotta get ready for November. Thanks for posting.
9210,"Yeah, wasn‚Äôt necessarily negative though, if you read the wiki article, seems like Joe‚Äôs was a fan of the onion pieces! Who knows how these things happen as to whether it was reclaim and by who or when lol"
9211,"It is a poor reflection of the mood of the nation's electorate as a whole, but by visiting there I found out that I should just die because I'm old, and that black Americans are ""low-information"". So there's that."
9212,That would require votes to get out.  They don't have any more.  Harassing Warren apparently didn't win over her supporters.
9213,"Joe on his own can give us PA. He‚Äôs from Scranton, after all"
9214,Jill and Symone need a break :)
9215,"Awesome, thank you!"
9216,That was an excellent rebuttal ^/s
9217,"Yeah, I think there's real mutual respect there."
9218,"It's not weird at all. I've donated a substantial amount of money to Pete, but he really needed to reach viability in South Carolina in order to keep momentum. The math that would have kept him within range of Sanders was really dependent on Biden collapsing and Pete being able to absorb a decent chunk of his support on Super Tuesday along with the undecideds looking for a Bernie alternative. Since Biden not only didn't collapse, but surged, it's extremely unlikely that Pete is within 300 delegates after Super Tuesday. 

I love him. I think he is everything this country needs to move forward, but Iowa and New Hampshire broke in ways that just didn't give him the momentum he needed. I'm not willing to play election chicken to point where we have a Bernie vs. Trump general, and Biden is a perfectly reasonable alternative."
9219,A campaign with an endless bu get funded by the elites that have turned this country to shut vs. a grass roots movement. We really showed those poor homeless losers HAHAHAHAHAH

9222,"You should watch the full video, he doesn't even say he would veto M4A. Biden &gt; Bernie because Biden actually has a proven track record of getting things done, and he would do so as President. It's easy for Bernie to say ""I'll make college free!!"" but he would not have the support of Congress for it and he wouldn't even bother to try and get it. Biden says he would make college free *and* is friendly with Senators and knows how to do politics, so could actually get it done."
9223,"Good point about her impeachment connection, even though she‚Äôs from Florida you present a risk by throwing that back into the limelight. 

Are you familiar with her political positions? I can only seem to find her gun safety ones."
9224,"Surprisingly some people LIKE their insurance. I haven‚Äôt had to use mine yet, but probably will with corona. But it seems to be steps above what I had before. And my union pays 85% of the premium. Why would I give that up if I didn‚Äôt have to?"
9225,"I don't see him picking Kamala. I think she'd be a terrible pick too...

Cali is already a lock, she didn't poll great with black voters, her prosecutorial record, etc."
9226,Very good analysis.
9227,Being Senator is soooooo boring. Say for the sake of argument she were to swing a spot as Secretary of State. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd get or necessarily want that. I‚Äôm just saying. That‚Äôs a cool ass position with some pretty heavy hitters that came before her. I think there‚Äôs a lot of prestige in certain Cabinet positions.
9228,I may disagree with ur choice but I wish ppl held this sentiment more.
9229,Im on the same boat! Agree with pretty much everything you said.
9230,This sort of thinking is why many can't join the Bernie camp. There are only a few things that are absolutes in life so arguing that it's all Russian bots is impossible.

As to how Biden can beat Trump? Biden has the advantage of hindsight. 2016 I think America was in shock including Republican candidates. No ones in shock after being gaslit for four years by the criminal imposter in the WH. Biden knows all his tricks ... distract and obfuscate. Biden has the advantage of Mueller report findings, SDNY investigations underway, impeachment over abuse of power and 45‚Äôs supremely shitty track record on foreign policy. If you watch how Biden speaks about Trump, you‚Äôll get a pretty good idea of how he‚Äôll beat him."

But I remember having to do oral exams in college and there‚Äôs that moment where your brain is trying to catch up with your mouth and your mouth is trying to catch up with your brain and it all of a sudden just blue screens and the only word you can think of in that language is definitely not the word you need.

The main reason I don't support Bernie is because I think he would lose to Trump, and his inability to understand how controversial things like this are, and how easily Trump could use this stuff against him is a huge part of why."

I can see those same qualities in Biden, and while I would have preferred someone from a new generation to bring fresh ideas and perspectives into the White House, Biden will still make a wonderful president thanks to his compassion and understanding. I'm just so sick of the politics of outrage that has been fueled by our current president, who is constantly sowing seeds of division. I fear that if Bernie became president, the polarization of our nation would only continue to increase with him fueling the rage. I truly believe that Biden is the best choice for us as a country to be able to move on and heal from this destructive presidency, and I hope that others can come to that same conclusion."

That being said, I do agree it's a weak app."
9293,"I myself am a progressive and my politics are to the left of Joe. I am a former Pete supporter. However, I think a good answer is to ask the question: why did Hillary lose? That's not an easy question to answer, but if we look at the states she lost that broke her (Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, etc) these are not states that are overwhelmingly ""very liberal"". They rejected Clinton because of her ""liberal smugness"" and her decision to focus on social issues/identity politics at the expense of economic reform and class politics. The evidence that she would have won had her policies been further to the left is few and far between.  A winning coalition needs to include many of these Obama-Trump voters, and a pragmatic straight shooter like Joe seems more primed to do that than an ideologue like Bernie Sanders (who'll never win PA with his proposed ban on fracking, let's be real). The 2018 midterms confirmed this theory : moderate Dems were the ones that took back the House in competitive districts. Only 7 out of 79 Justice Dems who ran both won their primaries and won their generals, and each one that won their general did so in a heavily blue district. I know it's tempting to buy into the hard left's theory that a progressive mandate is out there, but the reality is that we need those ideas implemented by someone who brings that coalition together rather than polarizing it."
9294,"Perhaps it's because they have deja vu from 2016, especially considering Biden is doing better against him than Hillary was. My assumption is that a lot of young voters who have never seen their candidate lose are learning from 2016, which is a good thing"

9303,"Welp, congratulations. It looks like your guy will win the nom. While I'll still be voting for Sanders in the Ohio primary, I just see no path forward for actually winning the nomination after tonight.

In the general election, though, why should I vote for Joe Biden other than just ""he isn't Trump""? I come from a Republican background (didn't vote Trump in 2016, though) and decided to support Sanders on the basis of his policies and general consistency and honesty, something we desperately need in the White House after Trump's brazen bullshit, corruption, and lies. I need something in Biden's policies to genuinely get excited about.

My main concerns in choosing a candidate are:

* **Climate change:** I'm concerned that Biden won't go far enough to prevent a global crisis and/or won't endorse some form of the Green New Deal.
* **Healthcare:** While Medicare-for-all would replace my health insurance with a no-bullshit government insurance (accompanied by a tax hike), how will Biden's plan help me? It looks like Biden will raise my taxes to support poor people's healthcare (OK) while my insurance company still dicks me over and refuses to actually cover any doctors in my area while charging deductibles, co-pays, and coinsurance (not OK).

This is also relevant because, while I was able to flip my traditionally-Republican parents to vote for Bernie, I don't know how I'll be able to flip them from Trump to Biden.

Sorry if this is a bit rambly. For many of us, Sanders &amp; Warren represented a hope for a better tomorrow, not just a return to the same old same old. :("

9322,"Biden is progressive himself on about every issue out there.  After 2016 there is little incentive to reach out to Berners as Bernie will probably fill the convention with the same people who cussed out John Lewis 4 years ago.

Biden is very likely to pick a woman from the same progressive fold as himself.  Warren would be a bad candidate because she proved herself unable to pull the Bernie cult and too angry to represent unity.

9331,"Bloomberg was one of the best mayors NYC ever had and made it a much more livable place. He increased life expectancy, improved schools, made sure crime stayed down, actively helped minorities (I know stop and frisk was a mistake, but he‚Äôs
done plenty other things too) by standing for religious freedom and equal opportunity for school entrance exams, and built a lot of parks and bike lanes for public infrastructure. He‚Äôs also a leader in fighting obesity, smoking, and gun violence. Compared to Trump, much more competent in the private sector as well, particularly with finance and software. 

Joe Biden, while I don‚Äôt think is as great as Bloomberg, I do think is still practical and experienced as he was Obama‚Äôs VP and helped pass many of Obama‚Äôs policies including things like the legalization of LGBT marriage and passing the Affordable Care Act Also, I‚Äôm a big fan of free trade deals too.

I don‚Äôt support Sanders as much because he is an idealist rather than a pragmatist. He‚Äôs frequently shown to be unwilling to compromise and while I do agree with some of his goals, I don‚Äôt like his methods.

9375,"As an American, this plan sounds ridiculous. High speed rail along highly trafficked corridors makes sense, but not what you've described.

We already have a train going from DC to NYC and they don't leave every 5 minutes. At peak times, they leave every 30 minutes. And that's not at all close to the flexibility of a car, because a car lets me go from North Bethesda (just outside DC) to Glen Burnie (just outside Baltimore) in around an hour. It takes me about 45 minutes just to use the metro to go from North Bethesda to the DC Metro Center, and then if we did have a train connecting the two (there probably is), it'd take me even more time to get from the Baltimore stop and use the light rail system to get out to Glen Burnie. That's not flexible."
9376,"It looks like people who were very engaged with Pete are probably skewing more towards Biden. All over r/petebuttigieg last night were warning posts about Bernie‚Äôs stans brigading our sub while we were hearing about the campaign ending.

Even if Biden doesn‚Äôt get all of us, it looks like the gains to Warren and Klob will hurt Bernie a lot when they gain viability in some locations."

I imagine the event you are going to will probably be bigger and maybe a bit more organized so I can't tell you exactly, but I wouldn't imagine it'll be *that* different.

Sometimes candidates will go to a smaller venue after and allow an AMA session, I know Amy did but I missed it, but I have no idea if Biden will this time or not, I imagine with how many states are coming up tomorrow and next Tuesday he might be on the plane to the next event without a lot of stops."

My longer answer if that Trump is a very real threat. The Republican media has no shame and will not pull punches like Dems have done with each other. My hope is that regardless of the nominee, I hope people will be motivated by the very real threat of 4 more years of Trump and be willing to vote for the Democratic nominee this time around (last time almost nobody thought Trump could win)."

9392,"Remember that before Hillary Clinton ran, when her highest title was ‚Äúsecretary,‚Äú something which people associate with women, sorry to say, her popularity was an about 65%. And as she has said many times over, when she stepped forward and said I want to take the top job and I‚Äôm ready for it, confident of it, it turned off a lot of people. And I can tell you from having knocked thousands of doors for her, it was mainly man but also some women.

It‚Äôs easy to postulate some fantasy woman, and I agree that Michelle Obama would probably be the likeliest a choice, but once you put that person in the arena and expose them to all the negative hype, those approvals go down. I think Michele could win it, but I‚Äôm telling you it‚Äôs extraordinarily hard. Hillary was so much more qualified than Donald Trump, the contrast could hardly have been starker, and we all know that is obvious.

So bottom line, to answer your question: I‚Äôm not saying America is not ‚Äúready‚Äú to elect a woman president, but I am saying they‚Äôre very damn well resistant to it. I need only look back for years to see the obvious, stark test case. Lori was an incredibly good candidate, she won all three debates hands-down. What she was though was a very good woman candidate, and at the end of it nervousness over that among indecisive swing voters spooked by James Comey, was the difference."

9395,What kind of stuff was he saying?
9396,"&gt; You're still insisting that being more charismatic and good at campaigning is somehow magical evidence that he is more suited to be president. That is not the case.

I‚Äôm saying Hiring a good team of people to support you is one of the biggest things we use to determine what makes you qualified to be president. Pete showed he can do that. Others who are much older and who failed are now being rewarded for their failures, while Pete‚Äôs being railroaded simply because of his genitalia. Kinda moronic move for the Dems to make.

&gt; The evidence suggests that this isn't true. 

[You‚Äôre denying statistical evidence now...](https://news.gallup.com/poll/254120/less-half-vote-socialist-president.aspx)

&gt; Bringing up that he's gay doesn't negate sexism. If Americans are less willing to vote for a less qualified gay man than a woman it just supports that sexism is a factor.

People weren‚Äôt willing to vote for Warren because she lied about her ancestry, lied about healthcare, and lied about fundraising. Pretending the democratic electorate was sexist after nominating Hillary Clinton in 2016 is just making excuses for running a bad campaign.

&gt; Having access to classified information in and of itself doesn't mean that much, do you really think that any of the candidates running were people who would be security risks if given access to classified information? I have no idea what your point is here.

The fact that he‚Äôs obtained a security clearance that high indicates he‚Äôs been vetted. It also indicates experience in dealing with the exact kind of situations a president has to deal with. Situations most other candidates had zero experience in. The only candidates who had that experience were Pete and Joe."
9397,"Exit polls are used to know if there was voter fraud, and they usually have a margin of error of 3-4%. If a candidate over performs the exit polls by more than 10%, it is not normal. If this happened in any other country, the US would‚Äôve already called the √©lection illegitimate.

There is no sugar coating that. There is no way to pretend that he is trying to win the race. He has lost and now he is endangering the lives of millions with his vanity campaign.

Bernie is 100% responsible for people going to the polls after Super Tuesday. NONE of this was necessary. The disease will not be defeated by April or June. He has asked for primaries to be held then when people will still be sick but they will also be unemployed and getting kicked out of their homes.

If Bernie wants to force the DNC to hold primaries more
than a month after he lost the race AND force them to hold an in-person convention. He can‚Äôt then blame Biden for not dropping out. Biden won. He lost.

**Bad policy** The core of the college debt problem is the expense of undergraduate tuition. This will make the problem worse because the federal government is handing state colleges a blank check to charge as much as they want and promising the federal government will cover it.  Their incentive is now to charge as much as possible and the incentive of students is to ignore cost entirely.  The federal government budget will face accelerating strain so every state college employee can have skyrocketing salaries, every facility will be spruced up, etc.  Contractors will lobby state governments to make wasteful, expensive projects for universities and pass on the costs to the federal government in the form of tuition hikes that students won‚Äôt pay.  All of this is money that could be going to help the poor and instead will go to whoever state governments and colleges bestow it upon.

**Bad politics** People chose Joe Biden and his vision over the Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders version.  I understand that Biden wants the support of Sanders supports in the general election, but the Bernie or busters aren‚Äôt going to be appeased and the rest would have voted for him anyway.

Wealthy people have more of every kind of debt, that doesn't mean you must be wealthy if you have debt. To some people, $10,000 is a drop in the bucket, to some it's EVERYTHING.

&gt;Trump‚Äôs attacks on governors threaten to pull apart the country precisely when it needs to come together. And you can trace them directly to his hurt feelings. If Trump perceives someone to be critical of him or even his policies, he uses a flamethrower in response. Take what he said about Jay Inslee, whose state (Washington) was walloped by coronavirus earlier than any other, and who was critical of the administration‚Äôs slow response.

&gt;This is how Trump referenced Inslee on Friday night: ‚ÄúThe governor is a failed presidential candidate, as you know. He leveled out at zero in the polls. He‚Äôs constantly chirping and, I guess, ‚Äòcomplaining‚Äô would be a nice way of saying it.‚Äù

&gt;Now is not the time to be a child, Mr. President. Now is the time to put away childish things. To be a man. You can begin by respecting a woman. Her name is Gretchen Whitmer. She is our governor. And like her or not, she represents us to you. She counts. We count. Please, at least act like you understand that."

9487,"(this is a tad long, I apologize in advance for any of you actually bothering to read this)

I agree that you have a point regarding how Obama/Bush/Clinton/Bush created a situation that ultimately made a Trump presidency possible. To narrow the focus a bit I would argue that the biggest problem was that the economics of the United States have made difficult to impossible for most people to get ahead. However, the debate which we are having now doesn't seem to be terribly constructive. (tldr, I'm basically quoting Yang and CGP Grey for the next four paragraphs, see last for comparison between Biden and Bernie)

I agree that we fundamentally need to reform the American economy but sadly being a protectionist isn't going to do that. Imposing tariffs on foreign good isn't going to do that. Erecting trade barriers isn't going to do that. Why? This is the part I think most people struggle to get their heads around. The reason we're in this situation isn't fundamentally because of trade policy (NAFTA etc.) it is because of technology and costs of production.

India, China and Africa have had immense benefits from free trade with the United States and the rest of the developed world. This has come at the cost of high paying lower skill jobs. It came with the benefit though of cheaper goods overall which means in the economic sense that the quality of life didn't suffer despite downwards pressure on wages. If we had put up barriers to those goods all it would've done is depressed sales of goods and not prevented them from being manufactured overseas. The delta was just too great. This is why I think arguments that NAFTA lead to populism don't really add up. Your car was going to be made in Mexico regardless. NAFTA just made so you could pay 5% less for it. If it was made in the U.S. it would've cost 10% more.

Now part of the reason why we never saw wages rise for the middle class is because of a shift in corporate policy. Companies in the 80's and 90's moved to quarterly earnings and shareholder value theory. This in turn lead to the idea that the more money that the people at the top of the company earn the 'healthier' the company must be. In other words, that stock price was the true indicator of a company's health. This has slowly been revealed to be b.s. However, the consequences of this philosophy was that large companies sought to cut benefits and treat their employees as poorly as possible. Slowly, companies are realizing that having to hire and fire people constantly is more expensive than simply hiring someone and treating them well. This is a cost which is hidden from a companies portfolio by quarterly reports and it is this cost which is why Blackrock and Jack Welch (R.I.P.) both encouraged companies to move away from quarterly reports and shareholder value theory within the last year. (you're still reading this?)

Second point regarding wages. Technological change has more or less removed the need for moderately skilled labor. This isn't to say that these jobs don't exist but that the market is actively seeking to remove/replace products that require moderately skilled workers (see Tesla's cyber truck as well as self-driving cars). So. Life sucks right? Yes, but here is where my disagreement with Bernie comes in. (you're more than half way through this mini-article!)

Bernie points to all of these problems and then wraps them up in the language of socialism and antagonism towards the right. Which they honestly deserve. They are a large part of the reason why union's got destroyed and why wages are stuck. However, at the end of the day you need the Senate to pass your proposed legislation to raise the minimum wage, incentivize companies etc. If you spend all your time framing your arguments as being a moral imperative and that the G.O.P is literally the most evil thing in America, then chances are they aren't going to want to work or compromise with you. (still going? Do you like reading STRATFOR articles too?)

This is why I support Joe Biden over Bernie. Joe is likely going to meet stiff GOP resistance to raising the minimum wage. But since he isn't as strongly disliked by the GOP than Bernie and since politicians associated with him aren't going to cause GOP voters to go out and panic vote nearly as much, there are much better odds that he will be able to get some important parts of legislative agenda passed. Remember, GOP voters are actually totally okay with raising taxes on the rich. They're perfectly fine with many government programs and I think Joe Biden can play to that tune. Bernie Sander's has made it impossible to ever convince those people to work for him imo. Joe Biden also has policy goals specifically geared towards rural America which I am in favor of and I think in the long run will ultimately relieve some of the crushing poverty out there and thus help diminish the strength of the GOP."
9488,I‚Äôve seen enough
9489,Joe will be in Downtown St. Louis tomorrow (Saturday) morning!
9490,"Joe Biden, collectively lowering the entire country's blood pressure in one single day."
9491,"I think it's naive to think that liberal leaning industries have no motive to donate other than they want Biden as president, theres no reason to think they're not corrupt because they're not as bad as Republicans. We cant have legalized bribery in politics it doesn't make any sense, and justifying it by saying ""well Trump's doing it"" isn't gonna get us out of this mess."
9492,"Does the same go for what Devin Nunes said?

 https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1239204553460838400?s=19"
9493,I have an optimistic feeling that Bernie has gotten the memo and will drop out. Hope I‚Äôm right!
9494,"Yes, they have gone well beyond the pale here."
9495,"Sanders supporter here‚Äî-I appreciate this thread! Even if we have ideological differences, we should all be united in our values. I don‚Äôt believe anyone should be dunking on Joe Biden‚Äôs or Bernie Sanders‚Äô supporters. Debates should be healthy, and non-toxic. At this point we should be focused on the common good, and the current crises facing our nation. Remember too, even though there are childish Bernie Bros, there are also Russians and Trump supporters spreading hatred and division. If anyone is rude to you, tell them to take a hike‚Äî-don‚Äôt feed into their nonsense! That‚Äôs not what Sanders‚Äô fight is about. Sanders fights for the working class, and rails against injustice. He is passionate, and obviously critical of the status quo. When I see there‚Äôs money for a border wall, detention centers for undocumented immigrants, and an ever-expanding ICE program I ask myself doesn‚Äôt that mean we have the money to make healthcare affordable and accessible? Doesn‚Äôt this mean we have money to engineer and invent paths to a green economy that create jobs for millions across the country? These are the questions I ask when I think about the soul of our country. I hope you may ask these questions as well and consider this fact: we will never be the same after the 2016 election. What will unite this country, and make us a stronger nation? I think back to FDR and the New Deal. History tells us FDR came from a wealthy and prominent family, which is interesting....FDR was, in my view, a socialist. I know the world is a much different place now, and much more globally connected, so I have no illusions that Sanders is going to run around keeping all of his promises (or even any of them). I just want to see a movement that pushes across the political spectrum for lasting change and progress. Protection for the little guy, and restraints against short-sighted, reckless corporate interests. We are not opposed to mom and pop shops, small businesses, and businesses where workers feel valued and are treated with dignity. I think we can agree those aren‚Äôt on the radar when it comes to the criticism of capitalism brought by progressive candidates. It‚Äôs these massive companies that pay nothing in taxes....which is like salt on the wounds of our sorely under-funded social welfare programs. Furthermore I don‚Äôt believe in ‚Äúfree-rides‚Äù. My dad paid for his Medicare. I would pay for my single-payer healthcare. Programs to lift people people out of poverty should do just that, but not by taking food out of the mouths of poor people. We should end corporate welfare that awards monies to fossil fuel companies for drilling off our coasts and tearing up our national monuments for mining. I‚Äôm rambling now, but I hope everyone understands that Progressives are not bad people, or even people who think they know best. We are humanists, environmentalists, and collectivists. Peace friends! 

TLDR:  VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHO

Signed, 

A Sanders Supporter

(Which is also ironic because in my effort to reach you with my views, I wrote a lot....and Sanders talks a lot...and runs over his time during the debates....yeah, he‚Äôs really bad about that.)"
9496,"I'm less concerned, personally, about party affiliation and more concerned with governors thinking they can ignore direct court orders. That's not how checks and balances work. You can't just get an answer you don't like from the courts and go ""well I'm just not going to read your response, so nyah"""
9497,"Despite Reddit‚Äôs love for guns, the vast majority of rank-and-file Democrats in the real world are in favor of gun control"
9498,I cannot believe there are 40% of people in this country who approve how Trump is working as a president.
9499,Accurate
9500,"Wait, superdelegates are already being pledged? I thought the process was different this time and they only vote in the convention if they have to."
9501,"Indiana was settled from the south, I think. It's culturally much more conservative and rural than its surrounding states."
9502,"Lol.

Next Tuesday's states are going to fuck Bernie's ass for the 3rd consecutive Tuesday, and he still doesn't want to give up? This will continue to give even more Joementum to Joe. 

It's great that Joe DGAF anymore and decides to act like he's already the next POTUS in trying to combat the china virus. This is the leader America needs right now, and not some far-right buffoon or some far-left extremist promising pie-in-the-sky promises."
9503,"Based on how trump is and his supporters, Biden is going to get eaten alive. He‚Äôs going to come for his life tbh which is going to be hilarious to watch. I‚Äôm not a Bernie supporter I was head over heels for Yang. 

If I have to choose between Trump and Biden, Trump is going to have my vote."
9504,I support Biden because the other options are Bernie and Trump.
9505,"&gt; We were feeling despondent about our chances of getting home safely. The guy behind the wheel now, Donald Trump, veers like a drunk all over the road of decency and values, driving into hate-filled ditches.

&gt;And the guy who looked like he was in the best position to grab the wheel away, the far more honorable Bernie Sanders, isn‚Äôt much of a driver himself. He‚Äôs got a way of talking up big road trips ‚Äî ‚ÄúMedicare for all!‚Äù ‚Äî on half a tank of gas with no map.

&gt;So, yes, we were relieved on Super Tuesday when you surprised everybody, you Democrats, and voted in big numbers to give Joe Biden the keys.

They could not come up with a more fitting analogy. Great endorsement"
9506,"I liked Pete. He was a good guy, his speech he just had where he was tearing up, you could tell it exhausted the guy.

I was on team Pete. But now I'm guessing Biden is the only opposition to Sanders. Warren and Klobuchar are more than likely going to go next, since steyer and Pete beat both of them several times in each primary/caucus and yet both dropped."
9507,Of course he is. Obama and Biden are brothers and I‚Äôm sure is quietly rooting for him.
9508,"I salute you!  Let's all push together for a great result across the ballot.  The more Democrats get into the Senate, the more bold progressive change they'll be enabled and emboldened to make."
9509,Agreed 100%
9510,"Why ignore Sanders heart attack and his attempt to cover it up? He‚Äôs looked pretty red lately and I‚Äôm worried that the pressures of the office would be too much for him. Shouldn‚Äôt he release his medical records? I‚Äôm not trying to start a fight, I‚Äôm legitimately concerned. He shouldn‚Äôt be trying to beat William Henry Harrison‚Äôs record for shortest time in office.

Thanks for your time."
9511,"Check out his platform!  $15 min wage, union protection, real environmental action, income based caps on student loan repayments with eventual forgiveness.

9512,Thanks :)
9513,I‚Äôm 18 and already cast my vote for Joe in Washington!
9514,Thanks for answering!
9515,Esta es la forma
9516,Please see my comment down below. They called me a trump republican
9517,San Franciscan?
9518,"Yeah, I'm not crazy about him. He's a little odd sometimes and too centrist for me, but he's got some decent traits and you best believe I'll vote for him if he's the nominee."
9519,?
9520,It‚Äôs up to Bernie to turn his supporters away from the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù enemy and on to the true enemy.  There‚Äôs nothing more important than beating Trump.  Bernie knows it and we‚Äôre counting on him.
9521,"Yeah, no door knocking in this election anymore."
9522,"Yep, they didn't like Joe much either, but they always thought they could easily take him and went after Pete and Warren, I have nothing but support for those two camps.

I've been torn up by Bernie people before and will again."
9523,OK Trump Supporter
9524,"What‚Äôs the username, I‚Äôll hit you with a follow."
9525,No I had to reread it too. Headlines that include two subjects take a minute to grasp.
9526,"It can be a little awkward.
I focus on the idea of getting the data and try to be nice but don‚Äôt worry too much about it."
9527,The latest polls are so good for Joe.
9528,There is definitely a coalescing with the Party and the Party voters around Joe.
9529,"MA also has a democratic supermajority in the state legislature that has a history of changing the appointment rules every time a Senate seat is vacated to ensure it's filled by a Democrat. If Warren gets the VP nod, they'll do it again."
9530,"If you don‚Äôt vote blue and trump wins, just know that there are 2 left-leaning Supreme Court justices that are in their 80‚Äôs. If trump can appoint 2 more there will be no progressive legislation passed for the next 40 years no matter who wins in the future. It‚Äôs not the talking points you were looking for but it‚Äôs what matters."
9531,"I was a pretty die-easy Bernie supporter after Yang dropped out and lemme tell you, seeing how he acts when his back is against the wall, I regret voting for him."
9532,"There were court cases and appeals all night. The last decision came in after 4:00am and wasn‚Äôt related to the first one.

Such incompetence! It‚Äôs hard to imagine a more incompetent execution on this plan. Even in the Trump era, this is bad."
9533,"https://www.mobilize.us/joebiden/event/149561/ join us for an action center training to see what we‚Äôre doing to organize!

- totally thought this was a reply! (I need sleep) But this is how y‚Äôall can get plugged in to see how we‚Äôre organizing!"
9534,"Classy comments and nice words. As a supporter of Tulsi, Yang and Bernie let‚Äôs, move on from the primary and focus on the most important job, beating Trump and election Joe Biden"
9535,Don't let this be too discouraging though. There are a lot of people who dislike Trump even in rural areas. Rural parties are getting their act together. In my very red county Democrat primary participation was up 20% over 2016.
9536,Can u give u some context/evidence on Biden please?
9537,"Reasonable Bernie supporters in the real world do not need any concessions from Joe. They are intelligent and mature enough to do the right thing. 

The Chapo losers who are loud online are too young, too angry at being unsuccessful in life, and too delusional to be reasoned to. They are to be ignored and blocked on twitter. 

The Russians who want Trump are on everyone's radar and they won't be effective again. The only good thing about the Russian Military Troll farm is that they invented the ""rose"" emoji on Twitter that Bernie derps adopted, so it's easy to insta-block/report."
9538,You all vilified bernie supporters for the last few years and now you want something from them? Get outta here.
9539,"Yeah just say no. If you can't think of something nice, don't say it"
9540,"It doesn't matter if you're a troll.

The question's been asked A HUNDRED (actually closer to a thousand now) times.

It's simple.

It's flooding the channel with people wanting to know why they should vote for Joe. Troll or not.

Flooding.

So here's the sticky icky. Just look at Joe's website. Track down a couple key policies you care about, look around and relax. If you want to vote Joe, you'll vote Joe. If you don't want to vote, then you don't vote.

I'll be sad.

They'll (the other supporters) will be sad.

But, that's that. At a certain point in time you've gotta do your own homework. Your own research. Your own style and skill. 

Nobody can just tell you, this is a personal journey, the sub rules are the sub rules."
9541,"1) It seems like you are committed to only looking at things from what matters to you and your perspective. A whole, massive host of people don‚Äôt pick their candidates based on a policy checklist, but on a ton of factors both tangible and intangible.

2) Biden is not fighting sexism or 3 decades of right-wing conspiracy theories for the nomination like Clinton was.

3) Biden is as good as or better than Sanders at attracting white working class voters to his cause. Especially union voters in the midwest. That‚Äôs a HUGE difference between himself and Clinton.

4) Trump is now a known commodity with consistently low approval ratings rather than the plucky outsider upstart that might have new ideas to change our circumstances. He‚Äôs shown a great deal of the country that he had no ideas and is completely incompetent. He‚Äôs fucked over farmers, folks on Obamacare, and so many others.

5) Bernie seems content to throw giant states like Florida away with his Castro comments, content to ignore central pillars of the Black community in South Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi - who we‚Äôll need to turn out in November to beat Graham and Hyde-Smith, and re-elect Jones.

6) Bernie‚Äôs revolution is great in terms of policy. But he isn‚Äôt building a big enough coalition to get young people and disaffected voters to the goddamn polls in big enough numbers to win in states he carried handily 4 years ago!

7) Political change comes about through coalition-building, and Bernie, his campaign, and many of his supporters turn their noses up at doing that work of they perceive the people they might court to be even slightly ‚Äúimpure,‚Äù however they define that. So even if he wins, it‚Äôs going to be hard to see how he‚Äôll get anything done with Congress while in office.

2020 is not 2016. The electorate is different, the political climate is different, the power structure is different, and Biden is not Clinton, as is widespread public perception of the two.

Stick your head outside the echo chamber here or there and listen to what other people value. I think you may be surprised that the world is a bigger place than you‚Äôve known thus far."
9542,The pooollllls!!
9543,"Back in the day when the race was like 20 people, I know Team Pete always really liked talking to the Yang Gang, because it felt like we and you guys were the ones who most had our heads in the right place about treating people from other campaigns with respect. Really glad that so many of you are sticking around still fighting the good fight."
9544,good points.    I don't think Tammy or Stacy are good choices although I like Stacy.    Not experienced enough for Biden who is already pushing it on the mental and physical age.
9545,Damn this is racist as hell
9546,Five thirty eight gets a c- from mbfc.
9547,"You‚Äôve summarized Ohio pretty well for the most part. I do see a lot of fanatical Trump supporters but I suspect there are a lot of people here tired of his shit. They also don‚Äôt want Bernie because they think what he wants to do is impossible or too much reach.

I don‚Äôt want to get my hopes up for a blue Ohio this year but with how shitty 2020 is going, I gotta have something to look forward to."
9548,"I've heard praise for them before, don't know the exact details before.

I've seen incivility by supporters of all candidates sadly, but I'm glad there is at least an effort to mitigate that."
9549,"The more I see of Joe stepping up like this, the better I like him.

You'd have to be willfully ignorant not to see how he contrasts with the current leadership.

Every day Joe does something inspiring to earn my vote."
9550,"I'm gonna furiously masturbate behind 7-11 to save you.  When good things happen to you, you can thank me."
9551,I can tell that Joe really loves Pete. If he wins Pete will definitely be in his administration.
9552,Missouri hasn‚Äôt even closed yet
9553,Bruh the dnc doesn‚Äôt have any real power
9554,"This is going to be awful. 

Bernie:   Corruption Corruption  Corruption  

Biden:  Come on Bernie  100 times"
9555,Its definitely an interesting dynamic.  I think it comes down to AZ and NC being more diverse and less blue collar.  AZ has a bunch of genuine moderates as well (massive gap between Bernie and Biden in AZ vs Trump).  The other good thing about AZ and NC is that they have important Senate elections (along with ME and CO) that could switch the control in the senate.  Dems are going to be spending a ton of money in both of those states.
9556,"Great job man!

Doesn't it pain you that the media likes to say Bernie is more popular with the youth? Yet when the past two Super Tuesdays came, his youth vote was hardly there? Lol.

I joked with my Michigander friend (a Biden &amp; Yang supporter), that while Bernie likes to brag about having 10,000 supporters attend his rallies, the other 90,000 that doesn't attend his rallies ain't voting for him lol."
9557,"Yes, there's a much bigger picture to consider: making decency great again, leadership in crisis times, restoring our professional civil service.  Every single one of us, from the most conservative to the most radical, depends on this.

It may also be time for some real talk about how well that worked out in 2016.  I have a relative who voted Jill Stein in 2016 in a state where that made a difference.   We all know how that has worked out since."
9558,"Hey! Welcome. You're in great company, I'm new here too (came over from Pete) but these folks are good people."
9559,He is over 90 infact iirc
9560,"Let there be a full investigation and let the people know what happened. If Biden‚Äôs innocent, he gets cleared and has a better chance of beating Trump. If he‚Äôs guilty, we replace him with someone else.

If we don‚Äôt deal with this now then the Republicans just have more ammunition to fling at Biden in the general election."
9561,"It is generally accurate, for me that's enough."
9562,"You also have to remember there‚Äôs a certain sense of schadenfreude that non Bernie supporters have watching him do worse in 2016 than he did in 2012 after being shit on nonstop for being ‚Äúcorporate stooges‚Äù and ‚Äúslaves of the 1%‚Äù and every other condescending attack you could think of. Kinda like watching the patriots or the Yankees lose, ya know? 

I may not like Bernie and I like (some of) his supporters even less, but come November, I would be happy to drive 100 miles out of my way to give even the berniest bro a ride to the polls."
9563,"If you are concerned about his ability to speak, remember he has had a stuttering issue his whole life. It can certainly still affect how you y‚Äôall even if the stuttering isn‚Äôt evident. This is a great explanation he gave.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWn1CkIU_rc"
9564,still skeptical of 15 min. seems like it would hurt small business
9565,He endorsed Joe after the math became obvious that he would be the nominee.
9566,"Nah I love my Obama, but this would be a terrible idea.

One of the issues against Joe (and same for Hillary) was that he‚Äôs just the continuation of Obama. Having Obama on the ticket would solidify such argument.

What he cannot be now is the Obama 2.0. 

HOWEVER, I would love to see Associate Justice Barrack Obama"
9567,"The party is pretty united...the vast majority of people picked Biden.

The Bernie fanatics who wouldn't vote for Biden didn't even show up in large numbers to vote for Bernie.

And finally, having both the President and VP pick be in their late 70s is a bad idea, even if we weren't facing a pandemic that disproportionately affects older folks."
9568,"Well yeah, that‚Äôs legit voter disenfranchisement that occurs by the state government run by republicans down here in the south. I‚Äôm from Florida, I know all too well about voter purges and voter suppression. 

I‚Äôm speaking to disenfranchisement of the progressive wing of the democrat party that feel their voice is not being heard. It‚Äôs our job to welcome them into the fold so that we defeat Trump."
9569,"Even with the big lead in polling, this chaos and the overall virus issue will only help Bernie close the gap somewhat.  Many seniors may stay home. 

  
Anyone know if that is happening or to what extent, yet? Not sure if any reporting from Florida or elsewhere"
9570,I honestly think Biden would do better in a 1v1 debate because maybe all those candidates onstage kind of gets chaotic. The GOP debates in 2015 were so crowded it was a vocal food fight. But Sanders will just repeat the same talking points so Biden won't be caught off guard even if Sanders goes low Biden can just point out Bernie's humpback as Biden stands tall and straight.
9571,The **Joementum** keeps building tonight!
9572,Not if it‚Äôs wearing a mask!
9573,"Are you being sarcastic? 
This was a support group of people who had just been displaced and are trying to get their basic needs met and a BernieBro is telling them that *if*they help with phone banking - they‚Äôll help with basic necessities. That‚Äôs shady and disingenuous AF."
9574,Someone we already know like Harris? Or someone out of left field like Tammy Duckworth?
9575,"We love to see this! Biden definitely didn't excite me the way Pete did, but there is still a lot of aspirational things in Biden's record. I'm also hoping I can get my mom on board with voting Joe too. She was a bigger Pete stan then me, so I'm hoping to get her on board!"
9576,"I think the never Bidens have created this sense of urgency among Biden supporters like we need to work with them and get them on our side. It isn't true. Of course they can have *some* impact, but in the end they aren't worth the effort because they pride themselves on being uncompromising."
9577,"What is with these people?.. 
Also Jill Biden ladies and gentlemen. Her and Symone Sanders are true heroes."
9578,"Sanders was mathematically eliminated in May 2016. He didn't endorse until July 2016, two weeks before the convention."
9579,"Her natural successor in the senate imo would be Raja Krishnamoorthi, who occupies Duckworths congressional seat and is of a similar political mold."
9580,"I guess I still don‚Äôt understand what you think she should do. Do you think she should have changed her stances? Should she not endorse people?

Some people endorsed Pete, Amy, and Warren, none of whom won the nomination. Should everyone who endorsed them also self reflect a bit?"
9581,a close win in Michigan and Washington and big wins in Missouri and Mississippi will do nicely.
9582,It's like a heist
9583,"I donated to Joe once earlier in the cycle, and don‚Äôt make much living on a resident physician salary.  However, I believe Joe‚Äôs the best hope for bringing our country together and also improving the gains made with the Affordable Care Act.


So I donated another $100 to Team Joe.  Let‚Äôs roll into Super Tuesday!"
9584,I wonder how publicized the cough is going to be.
9585,So much more refreshing. I'm sold.
9586,We almost beat him in 2018.  I am damn sure we can beat him in 2024.
9587,"Unite vs Divide

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/joe-biden-no-empathy/

‚ÄúBiden did indeed say he had ‚Äúno empathy‚Äù for the plight of younger people, but he was not speaking in general or absolute terms. Rather, he was making a specific, emphatic comparison between the relative progress and civility of the present moment, on one hand, and the upheaval and civil discord of his own youth, in the late 1960s.‚Äù

The quote, in context.  

Biden: ‚Ä¶I only had two political heroes in my whole life ‚Äî and this is not new, I‚Äôve said this since 1972 ‚Äî Dr. [Martin Luther] King and Robert Kennedy. And up to that point there was a war raging, there was a bitter fight over even whether we should talk about the environment, women were still viewed as second-class citizens and not prepared to have significant jobs ‚Äî thought that. And we were told ‚Äî people didn‚Äôt talk to one another over the war ‚Äî and we were told ‚ÄòDrop out, go out to Haight-Ashbury, get engaged.‚Äô You know, shortly after I graduated in ‚Äô68, Kent State, 17 kids shot dead. And so, the younger generation now tells me how tough things are ‚Äî give me a break! [Audience laughs and applauds]. No no, I have no empathy for it. Give me a break. Because here‚Äôs the deal, guys ‚Äî we decided we were going to change the world, and we did. We did. We finished the civil rights movement to the first stage. The women‚Äôs movement came into being. So my message is ‚ÄòGet involved.‚Äô There‚Äôs no place to hide. You can go out and you can make all the money in the world, but you can‚Äôt build a wall high enough to keep the pollution out. You can‚Äôt not be diminished when your sister can‚Äôt marry the man or woman, the woman she loves. You can‚Äôt ‚Äî when you have a good friend being profiled ‚Äî you can‚Äôt escape this stuff. And so, there‚Äôs an old expression my philosophy professor would always use, from Plato: The penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves. It‚Äôs wide open, go out and change it."
9591,"Bernie supporter. I just read the first line. ""I hear you."" 

Does Joe he really hear us or is he pandering? He said he would veto a M4A bill if it came across his desk. He says he wants to get big money out of politics yet he is still accepting SuperPACs.

How can Bernie supporters trust Biden after those words and actions? The biggest problems with politics is money and Joe is neck deep in that money.


I'll read the article later and will edit this comment if I agree with it or not."
9592,"I doubt staffers write these tweets. Maybe they edit these official statements (""We need you to draft an official statement,"") but assuming outright fabrication is highly cynical."
9593,"Absolutely. That being said, Bernie will not win, so I don‚Äôt really see the point of this question."
9594,https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxbusiness.com/politics/joe-biden-net-worth.amp
9595,"It definitely played a significant role but let‚Äôs be honest, the Clinton‚Äôs political history and and scandals, perceived or real, were larger contributing factors."
9596,"&gt; Sanders isn't as popular as his supporters seem to think he is.

There are all sorts of cognitive blind-spots. 

Keep in mind merging the two front-runners is where a unity of power comes from, whatever is the objective sum of that power.  

You can underestimate or overestimate the power of each, but together they're greater than the sum of their parts. 

&gt; he would say no to being Biden's VP.

This is all rhetorical, but that's fortune telling and my Ouija board is in the shop."
9597,ROTR is actually pretty important here.
9598,I wonder if Pete or Amy is gonna be his VP?
9599,Sorry you had to go through that. I lost my mom 6 years ago and will miss her to the day I die. But I doubt I‚Äôd make my sorrow about me .. would prefer just to say how marvelous she was.
9600,Arizona isn't likely to be the tipping point state. It's wildly unlikely that Bidens wins Arizona and loses Pennsylvania and Michigan.
9601,"I agree. Didn't think of it that way.

That bailout saved the auto industry in midwest but on the plus side I am happy this sub is so closely monitored.

Thank you!"
9602,"If Texas flips, it‚Äôs Electoral College checkmate for Republicans. I want it to happen, but Republicans are still closing polling locations all across the liberal counties in Texas and still have full force voter suppression operations."
9603,That's fascism
9604,"Honestly I don't think Pete would be the best pick, Biden's age means people will want to feel comfortable that the VP has a good amount of experience, and that was one of Pete's weaknesses. Pete will definitely be in the administration though.  Pete 2028."
9605,if you zoom in you‚Äôll see a box  I  think  it just didn‚Äôt load
9606,"Surprisingly I actually just sat here and typed that out. Also, crazy as it may seem, I‚Äôm sure both of us value getting rid of trump more than anything else. I‚Äôm here in good faith, I wish the first response to my honest point of view wasn‚Äôt immediately calling me names."

9624,"But that deep blue part is what gets me. Of all the states we need home field advantage in, New York is quite possibly bottom of the list. She‚Äôd make an excellent VP, but I‚Äôm not so sure about her being the running mate we need. She‚Äôs done great as my Senator, and I‚Äôd love to see her in the White House, but I‚Äôm not convinced she‚Äôs what we need to get there."

Not just on Reddit, in most media. For example, I get the debate pundits don‚Äôt like him because he doesn‚Äôt give them much to drive up the tv ratings, but at least they should recognize that, out of all the candidates, Biden, and Pete as well,  are the only ones that consistently showed respect to the debate rules and the moderators. 

And of course, instead of that, pundit criticize Biden for not fighting to win."
9628,Definitely!! I'll get that set up!
9629,"Ok, I don‚Äôt mean this in a mean or insulting way at all, but I think you are either having a logic problem or do not understand what happened in 2018. Do you understand that the Democratic candidates won overwhelmingly? In purple and red districts? 41 seats? You know that that was not done by just Democratic voters, right? Many, many Republicans and Independent voters voted blue. TheTrump voter turnout isn‚Äôt part of the equation. If you don‚Äôt understand that many Republicans voted blue in 2018, we aren‚Äôt going to get very far in this discussion."

9633,"Thank you, I‚Äôm originally from the Bernie camp, but I know when it‚Äôs time to stop supporting a lost cause. Biden is obviously turning out to be the nominee, and I will throw my support to whoever it is to beat Trump. But I do still have my concerns such as this question lol"
9634,"If he was facing Warren, then he would stick in the race and contest the result. After losing in March 2016, Sanders started holding rallies claiming Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be President and we are all aware of the sexist narratives that tapped into. Since he is facing Biden I think he will drop out if he is beaten badly next Tuesday."

9637,This map probably looked very different yesterday morning. Things change quickly when people start voting.
9638,Its still early but its looking very promising. The good thing about Biden is that he's already been vetted by the GOP so I don't forsee anything coming out in the near future that could kill his campaign (knock on wood)
9639,"Agree with you, only had 8 spots though :) IMO, the last-minute Ohio primary delay caused confusion but otherwise Gov. DeWine has done a great job of responding to COVID-19."

I'll donate money, buy merch, make calls, send texts, whatever I can do to help.  We are all united in a common adversary and we need to Dump Trump in November."
9644,Obama endorsing anyone before the convention would seriously discredit him among millions of his supporters. We‚Äôre on the same team in defeating Trump but let‚Äôs not fight each other. Voting for Biden would be like voting for Clinton he‚Äôs got too much political baggage and his mind is slipping more and more. I respect Joe and what he did as VP but he needs to retire. He can‚Äôt motivate the base to come out.

9647,Just saying. Every poll had hill dog winning
9648,"And this is why we shouldn't unilaterally judge any one candidate based on anecdotal experiences.   Joe isn't the apocalyptic vote that everyone makes him out to be.  And some guy on the internet personally attacking my character isn't going to make me a Bernie or buster... even though it *can* have that effect for some. 

I like Bernie as my #1, y'all like Joe as yours.   That's absolutely fine.   Both candidates need all of our supporters to win the national election. 

Let's do this thing together,  no matter who crosses the finish line for the primaries."
9649,"Pete is a hell of a man. 

Early on, at first I was wondering what is this guy doing in the election, I pitted him as someone just in it for some publicity so he can pad his resume and sell a memo. After reading a little about him and his background, seeing more of him, wow.. a hell of a man,

Please make him Secretary of State. It would be so proud to see him represent US on the international stage."

9656,"Honestly, this is a tough position you are putting us in. Off course we want your vote! But it seems like you are resigned to not believe any reasons we can give as to why you should do so. 

I can‚Äôt convince you based on his policies (point 2) or based on him (point 3), there is very little to argue. So I won‚Äôt do that, even though I disagree with you.

So I will only talk about practical brass knuckle politics. Biden is a Democrat; 
he will need Democrat‚Äôs to pass legislation. He will depend on votes from senators like: Bernie, Warren, Sherrod Brown, Tammy Baldwin. All progressive economic populists. They will have a voice that he will need to listen to, a voice that republicans can completely ignore. 
He will depend on democratic voters. He will need every vote in the midterms in 2022. People always say that being a politician is a bad thing but it makes them depend on you and your vote. He‚Äôs not suddenly going to swing right, he will be dependent on the left wing of the party to stay with him. 
This primary might force him to give important positions to progressives to win over votes like yours.

In short a Democrat will be beholden to the left, a republican wont be."
9657,absolutely no chance in hell. sorry

9660,"&gt;Fuck no. I hope both Trump and Biden catch coronavirus and die. They‚Äôre practically the same, just ones blue and the others red. I will never vote for Biden. And if he is the nominee, I hope the Democratic Party burns and is thrown into the trash where it belongs.

Democrats have abandoned any semblance of change, hope, justice and truth as much as the republicans have.

Not only that, but the democrats have continuously capitulated to fascists and far-right activists.

The Democratic Party is dead. Not only that, but the ‚Äúreturn to the past‚Äù that Biden represents wasn‚Äôt good enough anyway. And it has only gotten worse.

As people like Bernie and AOC have tried to keep the democrats as an alternative to the GOP and advocate for civil rights, justice and freedom like FDR once did, the Democratic Party is begging to capitulate even more.

Biden himself said, ‚Äúif I am elected, essentially nothing will change.‚Äù

Please do not destroy America like you did in 2016. Abandon this foolishness and find your courage. Find your moral superiority, your empathy, your desire for justice for the poor, minorities, and those being exploited like democrats once did. 

This isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúdemocratic Socialism‚Äù as the fear mongers here would have you believe; it‚Äôs about the fight for the soul of America.

A vote for Biden is a vote for the Republican Party."
9668,"That‚Äôs just not true. States have the ability to pass more stringent laws that go beyond the federal restrictions. If you were talking about a constitutional right, you‚Äôd be correct.

Same goes for pardoning/expunging state marijuana convictions: the federal government has *no* power to do so. The president can only pardon *federal* marijuana convictions, which again, comprises a small minority of marijuana convictions."
9669,"Sanders has really great dreams and was very idealistic, but I don‚Äôt think you would have received universal healthcare even if he was elected. 

I *hope* Biden can at least get a public option into Obamacare before he leaves office. Would that be perfect? No, but it would definitely be a step in the right direction."

Bernies campaign is complicit, this is why it happens and why it‚Äôs unique to their campaign. They‚Äôre the only democrats using division as a weapon, like Donald does. Here is the campaign dismissing the issue."
9674,I was wondering the same. Maybe he had other duties to attend to? I know he‚Äôs supposed to host Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday.
9675,"I still love Tulsi and I respect her for staying in the race so long. Her support for Biden will also silence those who said she'd run third party and split the Dem vote just enough to hand Trump the victory (laughable given her popularity in 2020).. I agree with the vast majority of her positions - and Bernie's. If Bernie were elected he would, in theory, do more for me.

I've liked Joe Biden for a while. I wish he ran in 2016. I don't think he's a great human being, but I think if he can hold it together, he can beat Trump. I have no problem rallying behind Joe Biden right now.

And I want to thank Biden supporters for being kind and polite throughout this election, unlike many supporters for Bernie. That went a long way towards making it easy to support Biden. I love vanilla ice cream, too."

If they‚Äôre already going to vote for Biden there‚Äôs no sense in needing to pander to them. 

The ones you need to win are undecided moderates in both parties. 

Again- why on earth should we strain ourselves to get the vote of the least reliable demographic when we could court support from voters who always vote and already voted for a Biden ticket in 2008 &amp; 2012. It makes zero fucking sense."

9691,"I‚Äôm sad to say this as a diehard Bernie supporters but he got destroyed in the last debate. Biden had actually clear-cut plans that he explained, while Sanders touted abstract ideas and seemed to be visibly struggling to fight back against Biden‚Äôs attacks. It‚Äôs not the outcome I want but this debate, along with Super Tuesday, makes it clear that Biden will get the nomination.

During a crisis during COVID-19, independents reluctant Trump 2016 voters, and centrist Democrats are all gonna pick a candidate with fully thought out ideas like Biden."

9699,I‚Äôm a bit disheartened by the vile comments posted on Youtube about Biden‚Äôs victories in both Super Tuesdays. They‚Äôve been making a huge news about Biden‚Äôs confrontation with the pro-gun guy
9700,"He's another lackluster moderate centrist canidate. The Dnc nominated one of those in 2016 and lost. They nominated one in 2004 and lost. They nominated one in 2000 and lost. Barrack Obama won in 2008 on a message of hope and change. ""We can do this."" Not Biden's message of ""nothing will fundamentally change."" Biden has not only said this to his wealthy donors, but has also expressed sympathy for the republican party, going so far in the early stages of the primary to say he would consider  a republican vp. It's a strategy to appeal to republican voters. His republican opponent is Donald Trump, one of the most popular Republicans in history. I don't think it's bs to say that however many swing voters he gets, Trump is still going to dominate in areas like the south. Areas which hold the majority of states he's won in the primary. That's not to say their aren't legitimate criticisms of his opponent. There are. Howver, many are uttern bs. To address the criticisms I see often of Sanders, in particular how he couldn't attract votes, I'd like to point to several facts that have made themselves relevant over the course of the primary. First off, the media coverage of Sanders compared to Biden. On major news networks, which happen to be owned by large corporations, Biden has been described as the safe choice and the one who will get stuff done. He's been consistently propped up by the media. Sanders on the other hand, has been described as a radical socialist. His identification as a socialist is debatable, as he only supports one socialist policy. That of worker cooperatives. This is clear red baiting, a tactic used by a certain McCarthy during the cold war. Basless accusations used to discredit your opponent.  He's also been compared to the nazis, with influential Chris Matthews saying his victory in Nevada is like the fall of france. Matthews previously said that sanders would support executions in central park. Others have said a Sanders victory would mean the end of days. For a supposed free and fair media, this seems pretty bias. The Media influences public opinion in an important way, and they've consistently manipulated it so Biden becomes more popular while Sanders suffers. You'd think the dnc would denounce this as meddling in the primary, but it seems they've actively supported it and have come up with tactics of their own to stop Sanders. To name a few, a number of super delgates came out far before the convention and said they would block a Sanders nomination, the dnc themselves have changed the rules of debates and qualifications, most notably the 11th debate, where their was talk of changing it to a town hall style. A style where it would be harder for Sanders to criticise Biden, favoring Biden as a canidate. Second is the tactic of voter supression. First off, voter supression isn't only going directly in and changing the numbers. There are other ways to supress votes.  I'd like to call attention to the fact that urban areas have been suffering from long wait times and from being understaffed. Not to mention Sanders supporters tend to be younger and more working class, so if they have to wait in line for 6 hours it could have a negative impact on their lifes, such as missing a work shift. These are areas where Sanders has high support. Now, it's true in many areas that the state handles this. However, you'd think the dnc would work with the states to make sure everyone's vote is counted and no one is discouraged to vote. This is not the case. The dncs inaction proves that they don't care about these conditions. Their inaction is the same as hypothetical action of changing numbers. Considering all of that, to call this election free and fair and that Biden is winnning because he's the better canidate is utter bull shit. He's the worse canidate, and is only being propped up by tactics that won't work in the general, so I don't think its a stretch to say hed lose against trump. Now, I don't want to close this off in such a negative way, or in a way that personally attacks Biden supporters, so if any of y'all would like to debate me, or have any otherwise constructive conversation, I would be happy to oblige. And remember to stay safe and stay home. Help flatten the curve of the crisis going on rn. Thank you for your time."
9701,Or what the other ex-candidates are doing. At this rate Biden has four running mates
9702,"What got me about those numbers was when you look at the details a lot of the support came from Republicans and opposition came from Democrats. It really did not fall along party lines like you would expect. 

It's why I keep insisting gun control can be a winning issue. Republican mothers are also pissed their kids have to go through active shooter drills."
9703,"There was a reporter yesterday who said Biden told donors there would be a ‚Äòmajor‚Äô endorsement soon. Also said that it‚Äôs not going to be Obama or Clinton.

Can‚Äôt think of who else it could be other than Warren."

9706,"I also voted for Bernie in 2016, then ultimately Hillary. He and his following have lost a majority of us. This isn't what the Democratic party stands for. If ""Democratic Socialists"" want a revolution then they should start their own party and get out of ours. I'm sick of losing and it's time to make American's proud of saying ""I'm a Democrat"". We need to lead by addition and inclusion, just what I've learned being a Pete supporter the last year. Join us. We want you on our side and we'll be better for it. We can do this."
9707,"Hell yes we can! More than that - we must. We have to stand together as a democratic party. Bernie and Joe are both amazing and they both have same values and similar ideas, they vary on their record in the past, their experience, their plans of implementing policies and , well, the policies themselves, but they are both PROGRESSIVES. As a progressive i refuse to have this term stolen for exclusively Bernie's supporters, i refuse for it to be stripped away from people like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and Joe Biden who had done so much PROGRESSIVE things. We must stand united, NOT smear each other because this is how Trump won in 2016 - he was using Bernie's talking points against Hillary! So please, DO NOT smear any democratic candidate no matter what. Do not give our enemy an advantage. We stand together. 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, i am talking about candidates - when it comes to the supporters, well... I am HEAVILY  disappointed in A CERTAIN FRACTION of Bernie's supporters. I'm not gonna refer to them as Bernie bros or whatever, but it is certain they are toxic, disrespectful and will sink to any level to smear Joe Biden. And some of them are already unable to answer the question ""Will you support Joe Biden if Bernie loses the nomination?"". That to me is UNTHINKABLE. You dont have to love Joe, but Trump is 180 degrees from progressive values, 180 degrees from progressive agenda, 180 degrees from our common ideology, Bloomberg, YES, even Bloomberg would have been better. Hell, even Bush would be better if he could be reelected because at least he wasn't defending nazis and confederates. To not support the democratic nominee whoever he will be AGAINST TRUMP is to me just unbelievable."
9708,"If you can get deer hunters to think twice and they are open right now.  Farmers, miners and industrial workers don't like bullshit.  They voted for Trump because of his, in your face ""straight talk"" but they know he is full of shit."
9709,"That is just dishonest, Johnson had a comprehensive platform and outlined his vision for fiscal conservatism and liberal social veiws fairly well, and he had the legitimacy to back it up. Legalization of marijuana was a relatively small, albeit sensationalized part of his platform. He advocated for budget cuts and reduced taxes while also being for a limited foreign policy and expansion of civil liberties.

And while yes Hornberger isn't ideal he does take the party seriously."

The polling data available is from 3 weeks ago, and only had Bernie up by 6 over Bloomberg. The Biden/Bloomberg/Buttigieg/Klobuchar combined number in that poll is 45, versus Bernie/Warren at 32."

9720,"This is exactly what us Pete supporters faced day after day, month after month, attempts at wearing us down with disappointment, despair, and even the questioning of Pete‚Äôs honesty and intentions (it never worked, btw).  If it wasn‚Äôt the Berners and Trumpeters and their outright lies and misrepresentations, it was the pundits either repeating some of it as gospel or simply ignoring Pete and his campaign.  One of the best scenes from Pete‚Äôs campaign, during a recent debate, was when Pete unhesitatingly defended both Bidens from Trump‚Äôs unceasing attacks and lies, as well as Joe‚Äôs face as Pete spoke so eloquently.  Pete and his campaign often used the word ‚Äúlove‚Äù as a touchstone, something I see missing from the Sanders campaign."

He‚Äôs here to beat Trump, but past that I‚Äôm looking to the next generation of leaders. To me he‚Äôs more the Gandalf than the Frodo/Sam, and that‚Äôs good- he can provide guidance and assistance, then let others take over and relax in the shade of an America that‚Äôs better off from his presidency. That‚Äôs my dream Joe, and one I hope to see come to pass."

9732,Done and thank you for the heads up.
9733,"The problem with Bernie's supporters is that they view *everything* in purely moral terms. There is no room for negotiation when ""medicare for all"" isn't a disagreement about whether or not such a program could be adequately funded but whether or not you believe *people deserve to die.* Because Sanders only *speaks* in moral terms, his supporters only *think* in moral terms. When you try to describe why hypothetically doubling the federal budget at the same time we nationalize 25% of the economy may in fact create some problems all they hear is blasphemy against their moral god."

9778,"I am full steam ahead with Uncle Joe! I am a loyal Peteple and honestly was quite distraught with our guy ending his campaign. And before the endorsement and all that I lurked here for a tad and noticed how welcoming everyone has been.

9787,"&gt; campaign on dividing people

That's not the truth. 

We're looking at the same thing but coming away with completely different worldviews. 

You stated a conclusion but provided no evidence. Sanders talks about having the government resemble the people of the country. Sanders talks about inclusion in every metric besides the 1%. 

##WEALTH

Sanders does not divide people, except when he divides the working-class from wealthy corporations. 

I can only assume your personal interest is to defend wealthy corporations, because that's the only division Sanders makes."

AOC (who I think would be a poor choice) would likely get some of his supporters back but I think it would hurt him in other areas. I don't really care that much who the VP is but in Biden's case the VP becoming the president is a very possible reality. 

I think he should double down on his minoirty support and pick an African America woman."
9795,"It may be what is best for the party. End Sanders run quickly before it gets too nasty. The nastier it gets, the harder it will be to bring the party together to defeat Trump. I also have to wonder if Obama is annoyed at being used in one of Sanders ads."
9796,Biden isn't a socialist and hasn't praised violent communist regimes. That helps.
9797,"I'd be wary of that. I didnt vote in 2016. Im actually a registered Democrat. I'll probably get downvoted here, but I know trumps base has grown because I became part of it. I am not however anti Biden. I think Joe is actually reasonable and can get some things done. I am one hundred percent anti Bernie. Just assuming Joe is gonna roll over trump I think is foolish.

I agree that tactically he's not effective and his strategy for how to achieve these goals isn't good, but the objectives are good. At very least there should be participation with the Bernie people about the platform.

I can‚Äôt remember the last time Biden formed a coherent sentence- and it has nothing to do with him stuttering, but instead his brain clearly not functioning properly"

9817,"&gt;the fact is COVID-19 is absolutely destroying industries and there‚Äôs not stopping that Obama or not.

What I honestly don't know is whether or not the industries would be tanking as badly with a different president. We'll never have the answer to this, but China responded rapidly, and what if we had done the same? Would supply chains and service industries be as fucked? My guess is that literally anyone in government would have been able to get in front of this better. But it's true that we don't know how much of a difference it would make. My gut says it would, even if only a little bit, but my gut, much like me, is not an economist."

Yeah, this really bothers me about the Joe attacks. I hear it with his record on gay rights as well. But to me, I don't care what opinion you held in the 80s, or even a few years ago. I care about your current opinions, because people are allowed to grow and change. Hell, that's exactly what we want in this country right now.

9830,"First off, welcome!  I'm a former Warren supporter myself, but happy to ride with Joe as well now.  I found his speech on Super Tuesday to be especially comforting for the electability argument.

&amp;#x200B;

All the things you outline are always needed by every campaign.  I think that small dollar donations help with the media argument, as an indication of engagement from the electorate.  And as a younger person, you're part of a generation the campaign needs to engage more with, so you're doubly ""valuable.""

&amp;#x200B;

I might have rose colored glasses on, but I sort of like that Joe doesn't seem as perfect and invincible as Barack or Hillary.  Remember the ""Everybody calm the F\*\*\* down, I got this"" memes?  You wanted to go and help/volunteer/engage/donate, but there was a feeling of inevitability of their campaigns.  Joe isn't that way.  He will NEED our help.  Despite everything seeming to conspire against tiny hands, we know this fight is going to need everyone.  I like that.  It's going to increase the ""ownership"" of every donation and volunteer shift."
9831,"I immediately feel bad for her and the inevitable labeling as a ""sell-out"" or ""secret establishment""."
9832,"How is this possible?  I had always assumed that once a vote is cast, it‚Äôs set in stone.  How can a person change their vote?"
9833,"Caught this full interview, he pretty much openly laughed at the suggestion. Sharpton was also pretty offended by it and was calling out Bernie for suggesting black southern voters are the ~establishment~ just because he didn't appreciate or understand them so they voted Biden instead. He basically accused Sanders of like, willfully forsaking the black southern vote and then complaining it didn't go for him."
9834,"Yeah you're right, the rules depend on the state. There isn't even an interim gubernatorial appt allowed in WI it looks like."

9841,"Same thought. I fell in line for Hillary. Seeing the DNC repeat the same mistakes again is disappointing. I refuse to play this game anymore and let my vote be influenced by mob mentality that we ‚Äúmust fall in line to defeat X‚Äù. I will use my vote the way it was meant for- I will vote for whomever I believe is the best choice for ME, even if that‚Äôs 3rd party, even if it‚Äôs a write in.

If everyone that was as disillusioned by both sides as me (at the end of the day, most are billionaire bought that will only protect their interests no matter what they tell us), if everyone just stopped listening to the ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote for X, you‚Äôre wasting your vote!‚Äù narrative and actually voted in their best interests, we might see some change.

9844,"This isn't loss blaming as much as it is analysis. There is a stark contrast between what is cited here and how Hillary Clinton expresses herself in regard to 2016. That is loss blaming.

9857,"The ACA (in its current form at least) is not all-payer. Each private insurance company, as well as state governments for Medicaid, and the federal government for Medicare, still negotiates price for medical care individually. This is partly why some insurance is better than others as some insurance companies have more strength and can get lower costs than others. With an all-payer system all insurance companies would be negotiating collectively (or one group would be negotiating for them) to get the lowest price."

9866,"You're 100% correct on the 08 primary point. I definitely should have looked that up before I stated that. I was just going off of what someone said on twitter. 

But either way, I believe diversity and competition is good. Also, it gives Biden more of a chance to adopt some more progressive policies. I actually wanted Andrew Yang to stay in the race longer for that very reason. I really appreciated that he brought something different to the table and put a lot of emphasis on the human element in his campaign."
9867,"If you are referring to CA, I don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve mattered. Bernie was always going to grab a good portion of my neighbors due to the $7M Sanders invested in the state (vs. around $450K for Diamond Joe) plus the fact that, as a deeply progressive state, politics here have largely become an intramural sport  between Democrats.

Biden voters seem to have been baked into this contest since the get-go, given the tightening of the race we‚Äôre seeing in CA as more and more ballots are counted.  The folks that were already leaning towards Bernie wouldn‚Äôt have been swayed by a Kamala Harris endorsement."

9874,"He should say whatever gets him elected. 

Legislation goes through the House, talk to your Rep."
9875,I also voted today. I'm very curious on voter turnout. I went in the morning and there was zero line and plenty of open machines.
9876,"Which ones are you referring to? 3 polls have been conducted in March for PA. The only reliable one from March so far is YouGov, where Biden is +6 (46-40). The other two have Trump +2, but one is a Trump Super PAC, and the other one was founded by Republican strategists that are consistent outliers.

Another thing I look at is how Biden was polling before and during the impeachment trial, which is where his campaign took a big hit. The Quinnipac and Muhlenberg polls paint a really good picture for him in that regard.

Biden can lead PA by 8-10% running against an incumbent with, so they say, a good economy. I think that's a big deal, especially considering Trump's pull on working-class white men in the rustbelt. 

For reference, Pennslyvania should not be that far out of Trump's grasp:

2000: Gore +3.8  
2004: Kerry +2.5  
2008: Obama +10.3  
2012: Obama +5.4  
2016: Trump +0.7

Another important thing about 2016 is that Clinton received 64,000 votes less than Obama in 2012, but Trump received 290,000 more votes than Romney.

That's literally what bernie yells: ""If you think healthcare is a human right, and not a privilege \[...\]""  


&gt; that we can't cover everyone with the public option in an affordable way 

Bernie doesn't yell that. But even so, I said:  


&gt; with a public option, it would force private health insurers to compete on the market with the public option. 

If the government started selling 80 inch tv's for $500, what do you think would happen to the private sector? They'd  
a) Figure out a more efficient way to make them  
b) Figure out a more efficient way to sell them  
C) Or go out of business."
9878,"Decriminalizing and expunging records are the biggest issues and they‚Äôre both already advocated for by Biden‚Äôs campaign. I do think going all in on marijuana legalization isn‚Äôt the right path, but I believe Biden said he wouldn‚Äôt go after states that already legalized it."
9879,"North Carolina and Florida are definitely in play. Georgia could potentially be as well, but that could be more of a stretch"
9880,"Biden supports a public option for health care with other tweaks and expansions to the ACA and Medicaid to improve access to and affordability of care. One big element is requiring that states that turned down the ACA Medicaid expansion (because they're controlled by Republicans) must allow all eligible people to enroll in the public option for free, immediately covering 5 million uninsured people.   


It's much less expansive than M4A but also has a far, far better chance of passing Congress. Even Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have essentially admitted this.   


His climate change plan involves a carbon tax to reduce emissions and fund massive investments in renewable energy, as well as an expansion of nuclear power which is supported by the IPCC plan. His plan puts us on track for zero emissions by 2050. 

&gt; Last question: Is Biden's mental health okay? I've heard people say he is not doing so well. 

It's a dirty smear. He's had a stutter / speech impediment his whole life that he works to overcome, and these naturally get worse with age even if overall mental health and mental acuity are fine. This leads to a lot of clips with him fumbling words and aborting sentences halfway through.   


He also sometimes speaks from the heart without thinking which can lead to awkward moments. Even in 2008 he had a reputation as a ""gaffe machine"" because of it. It has nothing to do with mental health, he's just less polished than a lot of other politicians. He's not a world-class orator like Obama, but there is absolutely *zero* evidence that he's not mentally fit to serve as President."

9887,"If the non gun community use your terms wrong I suggest you swallow it and vent at your next club meeting. It's not the laymans responsibility to use your favorite words.

And yes, any and all guns should be subject to basic background checks. Common sense.

But magazine size is not irrelevant at all. Again, I'm not talking about every single incident of gun violence. This is specific to stopping mass shootings. Assume it's limited to ten shots vs thirty. Assume it takes three seconds to reload. That's six extra seconds for people to run like hell. That matters a heck of a lot, especially in an emergency situation."
9888,I wonder if the Coronavirus outbreak will impact voter turnout in Seattle. Older people are much more afraid to vote most likely and are probably self-quaranting. I'm a bit skeptical since this is one of the hardest hit states with this
9889,"&gt; You have a real problem understanding reality.  He‚Äôs not going to win.

Literally everyone knows Sanders has no shot to win the nomination at this point. I mentioned this multiple times already. 

&gt; We‚Äôre past caring who sanders supporters vote for. We‚Äôve had enough of the blackmail. Bernie doesn‚Äôt deserve a say in anything and I doubt he‚Äôll get to choose a treasurer or a secretary for a party he routinely craps on.

lol it's not ""treasurer or secretary"", it's called Treasury secretary, a very important cabinet position. Nobody is saying he has unilateral say in those decisions, but the convention is when this negotiation happens, as it always does every year election year. For example, Sanders was able to pick a few members for the DNC platform committee in 2016 because of this negotiation power at the convention. 

Clearly, you want to stick to insults, so I won't try to convince you. All I'll say is this: condescending towards Sanders supporters will not help Joe win in 2020. 

We need Joe to win against Trump, your attitude won't cut it."

You have also declared yourself to be in favor of strikes without union leadership's authorization, and for you that's just ""getting the things going"". That's marxism, especially the first sentence i have quoted. I see you are on a huge mission on handing out the election of Trump and making sure Bernie voters are on board with you, but Bernie's not a Marxist and neither are his sane supporters. He will endorse Joe Biden and the majority of Bernie Sanders supporters are going to vote for Joe Biden, because we stand united under common principles and none of us is a communist like yourself. Joe Biden isn't pretending to be a Democrat, he is what the modern Democratic party stands for. Bernie Sanders is a democratic socialist and has no plans even if he was elected to allow the madness you're describing to happen."
9895,Got a giggle out of this Pete supporter. Happy to hop over to Team Biden.
9896,"Surprisingly little news coverage on the mini Super Tuesday. I mean, it‚Äôs pretty much it."
9897,It's really disturbing how the new narrative is that Biden can't beat Trump (but the guy who's base didn't show up on the most important day of his life will ) and that he's senile. There's a lot of examples of Bernie making similar mistakes that Biden and every other candidate do and I don't think he's senile either. Especially when you actually know what somebody who is senile or has dementia or Alzheimer's actually behaves like.

Which is exactly why he would say no to being Biden's VP."
9907,This crazy that Biden has the lead in the very beginning like before he even announced. Despite all the twists and turns and everything in between here we are at the end with him in the lead. Primaries are crazy and that maybe an understatement.
9908,"Sadly won't be able to be open to my friend group about support Biden even in the general election. I don't talk politics with them, and for good reason. One of my friends unironically thinks Bernie would win a plurality of the vote running independent and should do it."

Fear of the immigrant, fear of the ""welfare queen"", fear of the civil rights activist, fear of the non-Christian, fear of the other.

Contrary to what other may think, both Biden &amp; Yang are very similar in regards to worrying about the impacts of the 4th industrial revolution.

Hopefully through more discussions, Yang can change Biden's mind to win the former's endorsement, and have Biden get his onboard as VP. Biden's weakness is the youth votes and also the 2016 Trump ""swing voters"", something which Yang has proven to be powerful in getting them onboard with.

If you haven't already, watch Trumper4Yang's case with solid evidence of BidenYang2020:

Here is Joes environmental plan- it‚Äôs long so I‚Äôll just get you a link

What I think is a major point of difference is that Joe is leading a party not a revolution. What that means to me is that it‚Äôs our ideas that get implemented, not one guys ideas who cannot be effective because he‚Äôs seizing power with a minority and unable to lead. Being able to actually do the things you promise requires a majority, a ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù - has 26% support and wouldn‚Äôt pass a single piece of legislation. We would forever be stuck in this cycle of divisiveness and inaction.

We have this opportunity right now, where the majority of the Democratic Party has united and will push a platform together that includes all the core democratic ideals. That‚Äôs powerful, it‚Äôs effective and it‚Äôs the antidote for the populist wave of division that our enemies have exploited throughout western democracies. 

We figured it out. We‚Äôre a movement, a majority, we‚Äôre working together to win and to get our policies implemented. With a united Democratic Party, we have a real shot at the senate."

9980,"Hmm... aside from just ""return to normalcy"", I'd argue a return to civility and hope. Especially now that we're in a health crisis, Joe has been acting as a sort of Shadow President (as mentioned in another thread). He's provided calm, steady advice and is pitching optimism.

A Biden Presidency would be the most liberal presidency we've had in quite some time because of Bernie supporters ensuring that planks from his platform are at least on the negotiating table. You just have to trust that Joe will do the right thing and consider these proposals.

So a return to optimism, a liberal platform unlike anything we've seen in our generation, and a return to American authority on the world stage after four years of floundering and our allies saying ""we can't rely on America anymore.""

Joe will bring change - it might not be the sweeping changes Bernie supporters desire - but it'll at least be a start that can be built off of. Hope my rambling helps!

&amp;#x200B;

ETA: If talking to a Republican that's considering a change, I'd definitely go with the fact that the world thinks we're a joke right now. Even if they're isolationists, Republicans generally want a strong America on the world stage, not one that's laughed at and dismissed."

Nobody pays more than 8.5% of their income for coverage, if you make less than 140% of the federal poverty line, you get entirely free coverage.

For everyone else, copays and deductibles will be drastically reduced by giving people the kind of system the get on the Medicare Gold plan.

I don‚Äôt have to pretend to interpret how Bernie voters feel, GO TO THEIR SUBREDDIT DUDE. They don‚Äôt trust Biden. They have the information. They have 1000 posts of Biden saying he wants to cut social security, multiple times throughout his career. They have posts about his record of caving to Republican agendas.

We helped pioneer LGBT rights and fought hard to get America out of two costly middle East wars. 

Yes, it's true. Young people can be unreliable voters and can be apathetic. But you know it the opposite is just as true as with my first paragraph. Hell you know what, my senior year in high school.

Made me proud, I voted for Obama because of his campaign promise of change and the fact that I felt he represented all Americans including the 47 percent Romney decried. I donated to candidates, movements, been apart of what I feel is a necessary movement for the future of America. Yet I'm not involved or doing enough?

That pisses me off bad, my family traces it's origins back to the pilgrims that landed at Plymouth. 500 years worth of generations helped build this country and I'm proud to say that like them, I'm doing my part in helping make this country stronger and better for the future. 

The fact that he said that, throws in the face of everything I fought for since I became a legal adult. It's arrogant, it's presumptuous, it's insulting and honestly just callous. Yeah some members of my generation are worthless shatbags. But that's all generations, I guess they get the microscope because they complain the most, but still it's ridiculous to group us together like that. 

That is why I'm bothered by his comments. I know the context. That is what pissed me off."

He has spoken in favor of cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, AND BRAGGED ABOUT IT! And he has straight up stated that he has no sympathy for the struggles of millennials.

Why would I vote for a man like that? If the best reason you can give me is ""He's not Trump"" then Biden is no better than Hillary."

10025,Please look up what free media is.
10026,Ugh.  Ran across a Bernie campaigner trying to recruit folks in a non- political support group. Super tacky. üò°
10027,Who knows if Bernie would have even got anything otherwise.
10028,I hope Biden can also somewhat show his plan for decarbonizing industry and agriculture. Those are big factors in GHG emissions too
10029,"Bernie isn't a bad choice, most importantly we need to vote blue no matter who. Your vote is your own so you have to take the things that are important to you into consideration when you're picking a candidate to support. I can only tell you some things that helped me arrive at my decision.

We've seen how uncooperative the Republican majority senate has been. In addition to that, public influence on legislation has been eroded by the Republican party for the past 10 years if not more. Anything presented to the senate needs to be able to win a 2/3rds filibuster proof majority. All those things in mind, it's going to be monumentally difficult for extremely progressive legislation to get passed. Bernie's proposals are very unique to his campaign and it doesn't seem open to a lot of compromise. They're great as ideals to strive towards, but they're difficult policies to employ. Biden in comparison has already adopted a lot of the good policy proposals of the candidates who now endorse him. That tells me that he's open to new ideas if they turn out to be better than ones he proposed.

Bernie's proposals are also costly, especially with regards to healthcare, which is fine if you agree with the financial strategy of essentially printing money to get it done. In theory the US dollar isn't based on the amount of gold we have anymore, it's based on our status in the world and how much other economies and banks trust that we're good for however much money we print. I feel more comfortable with what Pete proposed and Biden seems to adopting, which is an expansion to medicare to automatically cover everyone, a cap to healthcare costs, and the ability to negotiate drug prices. The funding for it is accounted for and whatever the public option is will have to compete against private insurance pushing both to deliver a higher quality product that is affordable. If Bernie thinks having only a public option is so favorable, it doesn't make sense to me why he won't pit it against private insurance in the interim and at the same time not make the whole private insurance industry unemployed overnight.

The other major factor that informs my preference is just the nature of their campaigns. Bernie's campaign asserts that they're right, and that anything else is supporting the status quo. I can understand that mindset especially in my relationships with other people. I understand that mindset anytime I feel like I'm getting gaslit and someone is questioning something I know to be true. However in a representative democracy it shouldn't be all about what the guy in charge wants and thinks is right. We already have that right now, the only main difference is that the current president often thinks what is right is what benefits him personally. I know Bernie thinks what is right, is what is right for everybody. That's fine but think about how much your parents try to do what is right for you and sometimes doing more harm than good because it's not what you want.

The Bernie campaign also points out enemies that it sounds like they want to punish when they get in charge. Sure, bad actors probably deserve to be punished, but what I feel will be more effective is to show them that they are vastly outnumbered by level headed people who are part of an American majority comprised of every demographic and political orientation. I was a Pete supporter and it was a big deal for a lot of us not to penalize someone for how they voted in the past, that a lot of those people made their decision in good faith but were probably being sold a bill of goods in bad faith. Now that they realize what they've been promised isn't going to be delivered by this administration, they need to feel like they're welcome rather than be told that they're evil.

I'm obviously biased, but I hope that helps."
10030,I'd wager Sanders supporters are statistically more likely to be more politically active than Biden supporters making them more likely to participate in weird convoluted ways to vote.
10031,College Republicans for Pete for Joe. Gotta get the political diversity of the coalition in here too!

Between this fact- and DJT himself is more than enough to motivate any dem (or anyone else against him) to go vote. 

We lost in 2016 because of the Midwest. Forget all the other swing states- Joe‚Äôs easiest path to victory is to win PA, MI &amp; WI//AZ.  That puts us past 270 and that‚Äôs all we need.  The way to win these states isn‚Äôt by rallying progressives- we need a ‚Äúwhite bread‚Äù Tim Kaine kind of candidate who has one job- lock up the Midwest. Amy K or Gretchen Whitmer would get that job done. We need to win over independents and ‚ÄúObama Trump voters‚Äù

Why does it make sense to try and get the demographic with historically the lowest voter turnout (under aged 30) when we could just win over people who are both much more likely to actually vote and voted for an Obama-Biden ticket in both 2008 and 2012?"

Ideally, I‚Äôd love to buy a new car. But I don‚Äôt have the money for it right now. If I decide to only save up to for a new car and not get the necessary work done, I‚Äôm putting myself in more danger. 

Hardcore Bernie supporters are the people who think that the only solution is to buy a new car, even when fixing it is a perfectly fine solution. Even if my car is not ideal, it‚Äôs still better to fix it now to save up for a new one instead of not fixing it at all. 

Biden would fix my car. Bernie would buy me a new one. Trump would make it crash and burn. I‚Äôd love to buy a new car, but right now I‚Äôm maintaining the one I have so it is flawed to drive and so I will have free money for a better one in the future.

10076,"Gonna post what I posted in a similar thread earlier today:

---

Honestly? Look at his website. Read through his platform on a lot of issues. Take note of things that surprised you, and talk about *those* things. You'll find a lot of policies that you'd have no idea Biden supported if you've been stuck in an environment that screams ""He's basically a republican"" in your ear constantly.

For starters:

* Universal healthcare via expanding free access to government-funded healthcare

* Federal decriminalization of marijuana for all purposes, federal legalization for medical purposes, rescheduling for research purposes, encouraging states to fully legalize if wanted

* $15 federal minimum wage

* Eliminating private prisons

* Eliminating mandatory minimum sentences, and any jail time for drug use

* Ending cash bail

* Pro-nuclear energy with a plan for net-zero emissions by 2050

The biggest lie out there about Joe Biden right now is that he's going to be ""more of the same"" or ""status quo"", when in actual reality, this is the most progressive platform from a presidential nominee, ever. Talk about that stuff."

Some of the people saying that are just lying though. When you look at their post history they've just been Biden supporters the whole time. Playing optics."

He understands you can't just completely change everything all at once without giving people even the illusion of choice.

10149,"There‚Äôs a lot of removed posts in here because they criticize Biden, it‚Äôs really weird. Feels the same as TD moderation, looking at removeddit the comments weren‚Äôt even attacking people. This place is pathetic."
10150,I think you've got cause and effect reversed. I was a Sanders supporter. He lost my support due to his Kremlin issues.
10151,"Hillary beat sanders by 4 million. 

Hillary beat Trump by 3 million. 

So no, the primary wasn‚Äôt much closer."
10152,I was for Joe but his deterioration of mind has me second guessing. What tells you he is fit and sound?
10153,"&gt;I could see Republicans down the road invoking Trump the same way they like to venerate Reagan.

You would be correct. OP is also correct in calling it a horseshoe. It's exactly what we are having put in front of us, and for the life of me I cannot understand why the generally good people of that sub and everywhere else are taking the Bernie bait.

&amp;#x200B;

Populist vs Populist ends in a massive electoral win for Trump. His tweets supporting Bernie should tell everyone everything they need to know."

10170,"Lol, if the answer to your question was a no, then the majority of American Democrats wouldn't had came out to vote ""aww hell no"" to Crazy Bernie on Super Tuesday haha.

Look at Bernie's and his supporters' behaviours. It's all about tearing down systems ""the establishment"" and giving free stuff without any concrete plans to actually fund them lol."
10171,Mr.biden has people who will stand 6 hours to cast their votes for him. Votes are the ultimate test of a politician.
10172,"I really doubt it will be Harris at this point. There are better strategic options for the Biden camp at this point, and she isn't really helping her case by withdrawing her endorsement of him, to secure his viability in California."
10173,"It's funny you should post this now.  I was literally just thinking about how the combo of this group and all of the Pete, Amy, and other supporters uniting made me strive to be a kinder person.  

We're glad to have you here, and as another younger guy I can feel your pain regarding some of our peers."
10174,"Welcome, friend! I appreciate Sanders supporters like you that just want to improve our country. My main issue with Bernie has always been that he doesn‚Äôt have a realistic vision about how to get things done. But, I want healthcare for all of us and a better environmental policy and all of that stuff, just like most Bernie supporters. The difference between Joe and Bernie is that Joe has worked hard to build the kind of unity that actually gets stuff passed. I feel really optimistic about our chances at improving healthcare and our quality of life in the future with Joe Biden, and I hope you do too. We‚Äôre all in this together, and I‚Äôm happy to have you with us!"
10175,That‚Äôs because Bernie is cancer

Bernie's done. 

Trump's next."

10185,"Ignore it.  The nastiness of the Bernie campaign is how Joe is winning.

These Bernie Bros won't realize how they turned off every possible outsider until it's too late, and Sanders is on the ash heap of history.

10191,"Going back even further, Nevada. 98% of the Democratic electorate yet to vote? Too bad! Bernie is leading in votes and delegates so the DNC must listen to the voters and coronate Bernie.

10195,"You are right about the negotiations, that is how it is done to get a bill passed. However, you dont do this for the general election.

10201,"Respectfully again, not meaning to be vexatious, are you an election law expert? An expert on presidential and gubernatorial emergency powers? I don‚Äôt pretend to be, but I have studied this stuff in law school and have more than a passing acquaintance with election law. Dusting off some old learning, no question, but I am skeptical of your professed level of certainty.

You are unquestionably correct that a presidential declaration of emergency to delay a November presidential election would be somewhat of a different animal than a gubernatorial declaration of emergency to delay a primary election and would implicate serious federal-state sovereignty/federalism questions. After Bush v. Gore, can you really be so confident that such a power grab by Trump would come out in the Supreme Court, likely the ultimate arbiter here, the way by all rights it should? If not the Supreme Court by the way, it would come down to the House of Representatives, voting by delegation, which is heavily stacked in favor of the Republicans. It would take the landslide of all landslides to seat a House which would have a majority of Democratic delegations.

I 1000% hope you are correct. And I hope I am wrong in the motives I have speculatively ascribed to Mr. Dewine. I again respectfully suggest your confidence on this may well be irrationally exuberant, if you will, though we both hope not."

10206,"&gt;""In order to close the delegate deficit he faces, Senator Sanders would need to win every remaining contest by roughly 40 points,"" Bedingfield said in the memo.

I knew it was bad, but I didn't realize it was that bad. I thought it was every contest by roughly 10 points, which is still crazy, but not 40 points crazy."
10207,"Sorry, no disrespect, not trying to argue but this is categorically wrong. Most Sander's supporters had real problems with many of Obama's policies (TARP, expansion of the Patriot act, regime change in Libya and Honduras, support of the Keystone pipeline, support of TPP, fumbling Iraq pullout, a weak ACA that ended up helping insurance companies, drone attacks, I could go on and on but in short, his corporatist leanings). Many felt betrayed and absolutely lumped Biden in with this for good reason. This is one of the major factors in Hillary's loss."
10208,"I‚Äôm not seeing the sanders support attacks, could you link me such an occurrence in this sub?"
10209,"if he sweeps on tuesday again, i think bern will finally be burnt"

10211,"It gave me deep emotional scars that will never heal. That being said 10/10, highly recommend. But it makes me sad that we could‚Äôve had a competent leader in these tough times and we ended up with Trump."
10212,We had Obama already though. Now it's time for us to elect a female president and/or a gay president.
10213,"Selfishly, with the lack of sports on TV, I'd be fine watching another debate."
10214,"Sanders being an 80yr man at the same time as Biden is disqualifying in and of itself. He needs some relative youth on the ticket, I'd honestly be shocked if he had a running mate over 60 and not too surprised at all if it was someone a fair amount younger than that (Buttigieg, Abrams). 

The second main issue I'd worry about would be Sanders not wanting to be VP at all or not willing to be VP if it meant he had to support Biden's agenda rather than keep on promoting his own favored policies, with very little willingness to compromise. 

Thirdly, I think their rhetorical differences might simply be too large. Biden stands for a big tent, unified Democrat party. Sanders has consistently refused to join or consider himself a part of that party and in fact frequently lobs accusations at it of being fundamentally corrupt.

Overall I don't really see any chance at all of it happening."

You don‚Äôt have to be Marxist  to have healthcare, education, retirement and social safety nets. These things do not conflict with capitalism. Marxism has been the cause of more deaths by starvation than any other thing in human history. Capitalism has lifted more people out of poverty than any other thing in human history."
10218,"It's also not what Biden's campaign or Biden is about. Practice social safety. We're all on the same team here at the end of the day, we just disagree about how to get to those goals."
10219,"I find it hysterical that when the military wants money and has a problem with accounting for their budget, that as taxpayers we're more than comfortable giving. When Wall Street and big business needs a bailout, once again we're more than comfortable giving...

When someone has the balls to put forwards a Sander's universal medical plan... Well that's just *unreasonable*. No one could be that audacious. Lets take the position of scoffing at it than try to make it work for us, the taxpayer.

Biden is the embodiment of the ""establishment"" and status quo. Change nothing - *get nothing*. Dare to try Sanders and you might make a difference."
10220,"On the accusation against Biden:

It‚Äôs important to believe women. If this allegation is true, Biden is a vile man who deserves hell. However! Believing women doesn‚Äôt mean accepting every accusation as fact. It means taking every accusation seriously and weighing the evidence. As far as I can tell, this seems dubious, both due to the changes in the story and the relationship to Russia. However, it could also be a case of a woman being afraid to speak out. we have to wait until more evidence is presented before we can make a real decision on the veracity of the affair. But based on Biden‚Äôs character throughout his life, and especially the fact Time‚Äôs Up didn‚Äôt believe the allegation, I think this is probably bogus. It should still be checked out thoughh."

Being 80% right vs. 20% wrong is still very right. Sorry that upsets you greatly, but the truth is the truth.

That being said, if he goes with someone from outside the primary pool, I agree that Cortez-Masto is a very strong pick."
10256,I've wondered and I've looked into the prevailing theories. I'm not going to let Russian meddling influence my decisions because that's exactly what they want.
10257,"She might be waiting for Bernie so that it can be a 'total' progressive wing endorsement; it shows solidarity among Democrats and ensures that every progressive knows that the leadership is united. Warren doing it solo might sour some Sanders supporters view of her as well, and so by waiting it prevents infighting on the left."

That is why Joe has more of a comprise , something that might pass, especially if we regain some seats in the senate"
10261,Truthfully
10262,He stayed in after he was eliminated and spent months calling Clinton unqualified and corrupted and the result was enough of his primary supporters didn't forClinton to ghost get PA MI and WI and therefore Trump won the EC with 3 million fewer votes than Clinton.
10263,"Oh, damnit. I fucked up lol"
10264,"Take heart from the fact that historically, progressive policies typically get enacted when an ""establishment"" figure is helped/pushed by a grassroots swell of momentum.

10271,"Funny how no one in the Democratic camp besides Bernie supporters have to trot out the ""few bad apples"" defense over and over and over..."
10272,"Honestly, I believe that Bernie won't even need to do anything for the majority of his supporters to support Biden. I think there's a lot of misunderstanding of what Bernie and his supporters are about. Bernie will do what he needs to do, and Bernie's supporters will continue fighting where they have to.

The rest should be treated like any other voter. It's up to Joe Biden and his supporters to reach out by understanding Bernie's supporters wants and needs. I'll be honest, I've seen a lot of vicious alienation from Biden's supporters.

As with any other voter, there's going to be people who won't support Biden and ones that will vote Trump no matter what happens. Blame only serves to alienate more voters.

To understand what Bernie and his supporters are about, I recommend watching Bernie's fireside chat."
10273,"I really think we shouldn‚Äôt concentrate on the far left of our party. 

Biden already has amazing numbers in the AA community and shown to pull voters out to the polls.  As for young people- why should we pander to the least likely demographic to vote? I‚Äôm not being patronizing I‚Äôm serious. 

Doesn‚Äôt it make more sense to focus our efforts to address the constituency that ultimately lost us the election in 2016? White, moderates (in both parties) in WI &amp; MI?

Amy is the best way to lock up these votes."
10274,"Am from Florida, so we‚Äôre letting swamp dogs canvas now?"
10275,Yeah plus both Obamas already said they weren‚Äôt endorsing and would be supporting the eventual nominee. It‚Äôd be weird for them to change their mind now especially since Joe doesn‚Äôt *need* it

10277,"It‚Äôs actually beautiful in how much he has no idea how to be a politician. He only has national importance because of him happening to run against Hillary Clinton, 24/7 Cause of All Things Bad according to conservatives. Anyone else and he would still be a nobody.

Now, it looks like he will become a nobody, relegated to a footnote in election history. Nobody remembers the losers of the primaries, after all. All they teach are the general elections."

10279,"It‚Äôs already impossible. Maybe not mathematically, but he would not only need to win pretty much every remaining state, but do it by large enough margins that would help him cancel out Biden‚Äôs wins.

10286,Watched the interview. She‚Äôs dangerous because she‚Äôs well-spoken and has an axe to grind but it‚Äôs also clear why MSM isn‚Äôt touching this. She admitted that she shopped he story to Kamala and Warren (who does the political route like that?) before going other routes and that she‚Äôs now a Bernie supporter and that she can‚Äôt remember much.

10294,"I think its tempting to agree with you but voting is a duty of all Americans. A healthy civic society relies on it. I want everyone to vote, even if they disagree with me. I think a lot of the issues in this country could be addressed if we got general election voter turnout to 60%-65%."
10295,"A lot of people in the US have a very...limited view of some Latin American politics and see the world in black and white, instead of an incredibly complex web. Journalists fall prey to it too, some Wapo journalist was surprised on twitter that the diversity of thought isn't quite as narrow as ""Mexican"" and ""not Mexican"" and ""Cuban.""

 One side of my family is from one of those countries where Bernie supported the one time leader/opposition leader, and even a couple of family members who are far left (I'm more center left) were disturbed by his rhetoric and feel like he bought into propaganda. Not going to get more specific for privacy reasons, but I'm sure this is a common experience for many 25, and most 35 years and older, voters with ties to the region.

Not surprised about younger voters....but older Nicarag√ºenses...honestly, I'd be shocked if even 5% went for Bernie. He openly supported the Sandinistas, and people somehow twist themselves into pretzels saying if you didn't support the Sandinistas you would have been a Contras supporter...which is ridiculous. Plenty of people disliked, even hated, both...one of the few cases where ""both sides"" kind of isn't inaccurate. A lot of journalists don't get that, because I saw them going ""how can Joe criticize Bernie for it, when  he was a driving force to deny the Contras aid in the senate?""...like denying the right wing Contras aid somehow meant he supported the Sandinistas like Sanders. 

Anyway, older voters remember that both sides committed mass rape, mass murder, torture, etc. and the genocide of the Miskito...if Bernie had been the nominee and there truly was video of him at a Sandinista rally and interacting with high level members....I sincerely believe his past support would have been a massive problem, and not just a ""nobody cares about it 40 years ago except a handful of older Florida"" voters that it was written off as."

&gt; So basically, Sanders has to come back¬†quickly¬†when the momentum is currently against him in a bunch of states that are not very good for him ‚Äî or it will be too late. It‚Äôs not impossible. But the chances are low. The model gives Biden an 88 percent chance of winning a majority of pledged delegates, with most of the remaining outcomes being ‚Äúno majority‚Äù rather than a Sanders majority.

&gt;&gt; It can absolutely be safe space without treating religious minorities as second-class citizens.

They aren‚Äôt. Infact Indian constitution provides many extra benefits to being a minority than it affords to majority. For example Article 29-30 allow minorities to establish their own institutions without govt interference that is not allowed for majority.

And when we say minority in India, we have to careful since it has a very specific context - the actual minorities like Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs, animists are better integrated or even fully assimilated into the broad Hindu milieu than the abrahamic faiths (Christians and Muslims). It has to do with Indian history and the doctrinal contempt for idol worshipping. It‚Äôs a lived reality that people outside won‚Äôt understand


&gt; Hindus, even as a minority, can practice their faith freely here, and if anyone does something to prevent them, they‚Äôd be punished for it.

Hinduism as a faith is inextricably linked with the land of India. I live in US but let‚Äôs be frank, US is a Christian nation in all but name. It‚Äôs culture, outlook, socio-politics are all moulded by a Judeo-Christian worldview that will never be the same for a Hindu as India.

&gt;Perhaps the reason we support Jewish nationalism is because we know that we actually didn‚Äôt do anywhere near enough during the Holocaust, but I can only speak for myself.

That‚Äôs an incredibly western centric point of view. a valid one nonetheless. One that takes into account historical nuances and the cultural connect of christians with Israel. That exact nuance is what is missing when Americans look down upon Hindu nationalism when it‚Äôs exactly the same as Jewish nationalism. Both are simply two groups wanting to have a homeland (that they were historically linked to) of their own where they won‚Äôt be judged/persecuted for their own religious beliefs.

&gt;As for the final point

Nation of Indian is simply a manifestation of that idea that has existed for long. Nothing special about it. Also being secular doesn‚Äôt mean being oblivious of the roots of India which definitely lies in its dharmic civilization."

However, there's also a lot of Bernie accounts masquerading as Tulsi supporters on that subreddit - I looked through a couple people who 'support Tulsi' got Tulsi flairs, the whole nine yards, only to find them pledging their support to Sanders only 10 days ago and condemning other candidates, including Tulsi.

In short - It seems like the Tulsi subreddit is being inundated by online trolls hoping to influence your own personal decisions. They're pretending to be fellow supporters. I think you are being brigaded and I'm wondering what, if any, the general consensus on Biden and Tulsi's endorsement is?

10369,"1) The main points are a Medicare public option and improved marketplace plan standards with increased subsidies. Private plans will continue to exist, so in the event that Medicare reimbursement payout rates aren‚Äôt sustainable for hospitals/clinics on a larger scale, they have private insurance rates to fall back on so the whole system doesn‚Äôt collapse and fewer places would have to shut down. The ACA took on some of the underlying issues with American healthcare, so I‚Äôm hoping Biden‚Äôs plan will too as the policy becomes more fleshed out. But feel free to look at Biden‚Äôs website if you want more details on his plan.

2) I personally don‚Äôt watch the news, so no, I haven‚Äôt noticed. But even if what you‚Äôre saying is true, the media didn‚Äôt play a big role in this. Bernie lost the race the moment the moderate candidates stopped splitting the votes.

3) My point was that your comment about the DNC and Biden not caring about people dying was ridiculous. I think both candidates care deeply about the public.

4) There are a lot of issues in the American healthcare system that Canada simply doesn‚Äôt have. You can‚Äôt just copy their insurance model and expect our costs to line up with theirs. That‚Äôs one of the fundamental flaws with Bernie‚Äôs plan. It takes an incredibly complicated problem and boils it down to ‚Äúcapitalism bad, socialism good.‚Äù There is a lot of wasteful spending in our healthcare for a lot of reasons, a few being the highly litigious approach to healthcare in this country, enabling futile care, and poor communication between health systems. M4A at best does nothing to address these, and at worst enables them to get worse. 

The link you posted shows his tax plan, it doesn‚Äôt show his math on how much he expects it to raise and how much he expects M4A to cost. 

Bernie kept referring to the study in the Lancet when talking about how much his plan is going to cost, which is a terrible study for several reasons. If he can‚Äôt cite an accurate estimate of what the plan is going to cost, I don‚Äôt really trust his tax plans are going to be sufficient to cover the plan. 

Biden wants to raise the capital gains tax and people with higher incomes will have to pay into the public option. I admit that to to my knowledge he hasn‚Äôt published a detailed cost analysis either, but when your plan isn‚Äôt going to cover the entire cost of healthcare in the country, you have much more room for error."

10421,"Hey thanks for your question! I feel like this comment often gets taken out of context and spun to make it sound like Biden doesn't care about young people. In the quote you mention, Biden was asked to compare his youth (i.e. the 60s/Civil Rights movement/Vietnam protests) to the plights of young people today. He wasn't saying that he doesn't care about the financial/economic hardships of today's millenials and zoomers, but was reacting to the sentiment that the person he was conversing with brought up (i.e. that today's youth have it especially bad). I think it's true that our generation faces many economic obstacles the boomers didn't, but we also live in a far safer, more accepting country. The people in his generation literally demonstrated in the streets for civil rights, saw huge riots tearing down their cities, and dealt firsthand with Jim Crow. They were also drafted into the Vietnam War and saw many people their age die who were far too young to be confronting their own mortalities. This is not to say that today's young people have it easy at all - I'm 22 and I don't think that (i.e. ballooning costs of rent, healthcare, education, etc). But his point, in the context of the conversation, was that young people today don't have it especially tough. We just have challenges unique to our generation. They're huge challenges to be sure, and I hope we hear Joe talk about them at the debate on Sunday. I hope that cleared up the context of his remarks."
10422,"Honestly, in 2020, I think the gaffes are an asset, not a setback. They keep Joe in the news but are slight enough to forgive and forget about. It's the same free advertising that the media gave Trump when he was saying something crazy every week in 2016, only Biden also gets to also generate headlines with corrections and apologies because his message isn't centered so much on never backing down."

&gt; The¬†Shadow Cabinet¬†or¬†Shadow Ministry¬†is a feature of the¬†Westminster system¬†of government. It consists of a senior group of opposition spokespeople who, under the leadership of the¬†Leader of the Opposition, form an alternative¬†cabinet¬†to that of the government, and whose members shadow or mirror the positions of each individual member of the Cabinet.[1]¬†It is the Shadow Cabinet's responsibility to scrutinise the policies and actions of the government, as well as to offer alternative policies.

10429,"Yes, Tulsi voted ""present"" on the impeachment. Nancy Pelosi gave a ""WTF?"" expression upon announcing that."
10430,Why has Joe gone off radar after that gaffe on TV? Is he okay? It looked like is zoned out a bit or is that just my imagination?
10431,This is noncontroversial to you?
10432,Voted 9 am this morning. My polling place was Brisk.
10433,"Yeah as soon as they eliminate the Electoral college they can fix this system. Till then this accurately reflects how the election works, right?"

10437,"Biden isn't far left, but the Democratic Party has for sure moved left over the last couple decades, and Biden has moved with it. My guess is he's probably about right in the middle of the party as a whole, where as Sanders is way on the left end, and the right end of the party is someone like Joe Manchin. 

If we really wanted to split hairs we could say Warren is on the left end of the party since Bernie isn't actually a Democrat."

10443,"Here‚Äôs the bottom line, Jack. Bernie will have the upper hand in this debate tonight because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Joe is also prone to gaffes and memory slip-ups on small details when speaking fast and sometimes breaks from his talking points to improv more than Bernie does. Bernie likely will win tonight‚Äôs debate by exposing the problems present in America and asking why we can‚Äôt do better. We also know the Bernie bros will be pushing a false dementia narrative for any and all stutters, stammers or memory slips that Joe immediately corrects. They will edit videos alongside Republicans to push this tonight no matter how things go. 

Trump and Bernie supporters dominate social media but they the people who are going to make Biden President aren‚Äôt sitting there on social media late night anyway. 

All that matters here is the mainstream media narrative coming out of tonight snd even that won‚Äôt move the needle much. All Joe has to do is focus on how unrealistic Bernie‚Äôs plans are to be passed and what his own plan does to improve from the present and avoid any enormous mistakes that play into any pre-existing narratives in ways that the mainstream media pounce on. 

One concern? It‚Äôs in the MSM‚Äôs best interest to make this race feel closer to drive political ads and more on their networks. They will be looking for anything to say that Bernie may have closed the gap tonight."
10444,As in I‚Äôm surprised it hasn‚Äôt been removed.
10445,"Because Bernie shut down any progressive ideas she or Yang had. They both realize Bernie isn't who they thought he was and it probably makes them both sad, but they aren't ideological. They're ready to take on reality and unity is much better than division."
10446,"I say this as a Biden fan, I have to disagree. He seemed to have no idea what he was talking about."
10447,I doubt Mike even wants a job in the administration.  He has been in charge since the 80s of whatever he is doing.  Running his philanthropy with 60B is going to be more appealing to him.  Probably will see some of his staff from his time as mayor working in the administration.  He has a reputation for hiring smart people that work insane hours.

10451,"Joe Biden‚Äôs career has been marred with a consistent and unrepentant effort to be ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù- in other words: jail black and brown people for petty offenses and wash his hands of thinking about any of the various broader socio-economic issues that might correlate with crime. No amount of half-hearted apologies is enough to drown out the pain of the millions of Americans that were incarcerated as a direct result of [Joe Biden‚Äôs crass disposal to work with segregationists to draft bills that disproportionately targeted poor black and brown communities and lead to an era of unparalleled mass incarceration](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/joe-biden-crime-laws.html)

Joe Biden also doesn‚Äôt have a good history with women.

Eight women so far have come out and accused Biden of inappropriate behavior, and it‚Äôs not just ill-advised risqu√© remarks, [it‚Äôs borderline sexual assault](https://www.thecut.com/2019/04/joe-biden-accuser-accusations-allegations.html) and I‚Äôll just throw in [his silencing of Anita Hill as she went out to name her abuser](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/politics/joe-biden-anita-hill.html)

I‚Äôd vote for Biden over Trump, but there‚Äôs no preemptive case for him over Bernie. I understand how badly you want a return to civility and how willing you are to compromise, but when you find yourself preemptively ceding ground to a man who shares so many of his most irredeemable qualities and callous decision-making with the likes of Trump, you‚Äôre only hurting yourself and y‚Äôknow- America. 

And don‚Äôt give me the electability argument. Trump is an incredibly unpopular president. Hillary Clinton was a weaker candidate than Biden is today and she beat him in the popular vote, both Biden and Bernie poll favorably in a head-to-head matchup against Trump, so why are you knee-capping progressive movements by going for the centrist?

Hot take: I feel like the primary campaign wrapped up on Monday. Joe and Bernie can only ""get out the vote"" at this point. Likely scenarios put Joe with a solid plurality of the votes. Unless something crazy happens"

She is a good woman and misunderstood by the majority of you and despite you thinking she had no support, she actually does. I am one of those people and while I have felt pretty unwelcome here because you cannot understand why someone can like Tulsi and Joe, they are really not that far apart. They are both good people and want the best for this country. You might see people joining this sub who supports Tulsi and wants what is best for America. So please stop being petty and insulting Tulsi because you think she is a Russian Asset and an Assad apologist because she is not."
10464,"I think a lot of people who supported Bernie did so because there was a belief that his proposals would inspire a huge turnout that would carry to November. That didn‚Äôt happen and his coalition proved to be smaller than I suspected. On the flip side, you look at the turnout in some swing states like Virginia and NC for Biden, and even if he isn‚Äôt my first choice, how can I not be inspired by that? I might not agree with Joe on everything, but he has a smart, reasonable, and progressive platform that I can be enthusiastic about"

Biden: You're fulfilling your destiny, Pete. Become my apprentice, learn to use the Liberal Side of the Force.

Pete: I will do whatever you ask.

Biden: Good.

Pete: Just help me save the evidence based internationalism and American hegemony. I can't live without it.

Biden: To cheat socialism and fascism is a power only one has achieved but if we work together I know we can discover the secret...

Pete: I pledge myself to your teachings.

Biden: Good. Good.

Biden: The Force is strong with you. A powerful neoliberal you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth... Director of National Intelligence.

Pete: Thank you, my master.

Biden: Rise.

Biden: Because the succs did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Millennial with no knowledge of this plot. When the succs learn what has transpired here they will guillotine us in Central Park along with all the superdelegates.

Pete: I agree. The succs next move with be against the Democratic National Committee. 

Biden: Every single succ, including your friend, Elizabeth Warren, is now an enemy of the Republic.

Pete: I understand, Master.

Biden: We must move quickly, the Bernie Bros are relentless. If they are not destroyed it will be 2016 without end.

Biden: First, I want you to go to /r/politics, we will catch them off-balance. Do what must be done, Lord Director of National Intelligence. Do not hesitate, show no mercy! Only then will you be strong enough with the Liberal Side to save globalism.

Pete: What about the other succs spread across Reddit? 

Biden: Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you've killed all the Bernie Bros on /r/politics, go to /r/WayOfTheBern, wipe out the Bernie to Trump voters and the other DemExit leaders. Once more the neoliberals will rule the planet, and we shall have peace."

He was actually my guy there before he dropped out, that was the first time I was eligible to vote. Judging by Reddit I guess I'm pretty rare but I have been looking forward to voting for Joe for a long time. I was excited to see him win the nomination at the Democratic Convention, I couldn't wait to see him triumph over Trump..

... but this coronavirus really just puts a damper on everything. It almost feels gauche to even discuss the election in the face of this catastrophe. Now I can't help but just pray for everybody's loved ones to be safe so we can get through this together."

To your point of worrying that back to normal isn‚Äôt good enough to beat trump consider this:  the last 3 and a half years have been a dizzying amount of chaos at the hands of trump.  All of the unpresidential behavior, all of the shattered norms, all of the Jesus Christ he said what?? Moments.  I think most Americans just want politics to be boring again.  I think 2020 is ripe for an oh god just make it all stop candidate.

I‚Äôm support of this.  Look at the 2018 house elections.  The races where we picked up republican seats were ones where we focused on Health Care, Jobs, and public Safety in rather generic ways.  Examples the AZ senate race, MN 2,3 and GA 6 house races along with the seats we flipped in Iowa.  Bombastic non traditional Democrats candidates like Randy Bryce, Richard Ojeda, and similar style candidates came up short."

Hats off to Bernie and his supporters, who manage to build a lot of genuine enthusiasm. Unfortunately, as the results from tonight show, young voters don't actually turn out to vote. How can we build enthusiasm among folks who are online to complement the awesome coalition Biden is building and dominate the discourse on all fronts?

10528,"Well, while Warren is still in the race they are slinging a lot of shit her way too. There are Bernie supporters who are very angry that she has not dropped out. I see people accusing her of being nothing but an anti-Bernie plant because ""why else would she still be in the race if not to tank Bernie and swing the race toward Biden?"" And I'm like, uh, maybe because she thinks she's the best candidate and wants to be President and thinks she still has  a shot? I mean, duh.

Also I was catching up on 538 and thinking about the nature of the candidates, Biden and Bernie. It's not like Bernie is telling his supporters to go out and be jerks to all the other candidates, but-- well, here's how Perry Bacon on 538 put it  (emphasis mine):

&gt; On Feb. 21 ‚Äî a day before the Nevada caucuses, which polls showed him very likely to win ‚Äî Sanders tweeted, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got news for the Republican establishment. I‚Äôve got news for the Democratic establishment. They can‚Äôt stop us.‚Äù **That tweet was generally in line with how Sanders and his aides positioned themselves in the days before Super Tuesday ‚Äî an insurgent campaign attempting a hostile takeover of the Democratic Party.** One question I will always have is whether Sanders could have avoided this flood of endorsements against him if the senator had shifted post-Nevada to talking less about his agenda and more about, say, his own electability, helping the Democrats win the House and Senate and generally unifying the party."
10529,"Sanders supporters have fight in them, no doubt. Too bad the timing was bad. Not to be Captain Obvious, but seriously ,Trump in charge of our country is a danger to the planet.

Racism exists everywhere, but there is a visceral *feel* to it and in a lot of places, some hopelessness after decades of that oppression. But the people persist, and if you're saying you're bringing down the establishment, well who do you think has been helping the people out there all along?"
10546,"You don't have to change my mind. As it stands, if Biden becomes the nomination based on popular vote, I will support him. Meanwhile I will be spreading information about Bernie so that people can see he is better equipped to beat Donald Trump. I just hope you will vote for Bernie if he wins the nomination. I fear that  many moderates want to beat Bernie more than Trump."
10547,"I agree that the building is very far away and not on the same plane. But the camera pans left across the building then jumps back and pans left again several times over. Its a long line, but a misleading portrayal of how long."

10551,I think usually the VP is announced by the presumed nominee in the days or weeks leading up to the convention because both the President and VP are nominated there.
10552,"MANY CCs (many of which are EXCELLENT schools that attract people who teach because they love teaching, not for money or research cred etc) are outright designed for this. 

I'm an AS and AA (...the AA was accidental) student at a CC, and at ours, any AA degree and I believe the AS degrees too are guaranteed not just direct credit transfer to bachelors degrees at but iirc also college acceptance for the state universities. And in fact a lot of the AS/AAs are designed with course list synergy too; the classes my AS required for its first year directly equaled the 1 year related certificate in the same field, and the classes required for the first two years of bachelors at the state uni are literally all the exact credits in my AS. They're intended to and ADVERTISED to flow into each other in a waterfall series.

Plus imma be real CCs get all the cool vocational classes, my CC is its own firefighter academy."
10553,Fuck Joe Biden. Fucking Pedo.
10554,Ultimately it's states that hold and maintain elections so he really has no power to change election dates unilaterally.
10555,Yes

10560,"&gt;Most billionaires don‚Äôt have a billion dollars sitting in a bank account (minus maybe Bezos), they hold assets and have stakes in companies

Wouldn't that be the same for the millionaires as well? Or are you saying that the millionaires do have all their money sitting in their bank account?"
10561,"If we end this 4 months earlier than last time, we'd be in pretty great shape for the general election. Bernie supporters can take a few months to refocus on Trump and then we might all be able to stand together as a united front against him. And all the Democratic presidential candidates (besides Tulsi) coming together would be an amazing thing to see."
10562,"The only thing I want for this is I want Bernie on our side, and I want Trump to be the other side"
10563,"While that may be fine with the 2nd (delegate) vote since you placed your trust in who you voted for, it's not really fair for the 1st vote.  
  
Not *everyone* who voted for Pete would want Biden as their 2nd choice.   
  
I do think Ranked voting is the future. Or at least the ability to re-cast your early vote (I know *some* states allow it)."
10564,"I agree with you one hundred percent. Of course, Sanders only has bad faith reasons left to stay in the race. [The New York Times did an article this morning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign.html) and apparently there are some rumors that he is considering staying in the race because the Coronavirus crisis may give new life to his Medicare for All platform. This is really stunning to me. The party has rejected his platform (or its messenger) and he is looking for any reason he can to try to justify his continued screeching about it, regardless of the potential damage it could do the party general election chances.  


Sanders is a narcissistic megalomaniac."

10587,"Kind of. Biden‚Äôs plan doesn‚Äôt go as far as that though. Sanders‚Äô plan eliminates all private insurance within 4 or so years while some other progressive Democrats advocate for a public option to start with and then moving towards single payer over a longer period. Biden doesn‚Äôt have any plans to eliminate private insurance. For some people that I know that‚Äôs a nonstarter as they deeply want a single-payer system.  And that is fair but it‚Äôs important to remember that it‚Äôs very possible to have universal healthcare without single-payer, in fact most countries in the world are not true single payer systems. That being said I personally would like an all-payer system but I won‚Äôt bore you with that. Lol"

10592,"It's not NRA talking points, it's informed, intelligent discussion. Just like elderly Republicans shouldn't dictate when and how women should or shouldn't get abortions, people with no knowledge of how firearms function shouldn't be dictating blanket bans or law changes. We should always expect our leaders and legislators to approach issues from a position of knowledge and nuance.

These things are important to a lot of us. It might not bubble up through the conversation online where everyone is so polarized, but there are lots of people all over the US who are liberal or at least democratic-leaning and yet still support gun rights.

10605,I'd hazard a guess that the reason you can't place you finger on was secondhand propoganda.

10645,"I‚Äôm for Buttigieg for VP or at the very least a cabinet position! Joe‚Äôs the NOW, Pete is the FUTURE!"
10646,"&gt; I understand that the DNC wants Biden

It's not ""the DNC"", it's ""the majority of voters in the democratic party"". 

&gt; Biden does not support national healthcare or even affordable healthcare.

Biden supports universal healthcare. Universal healthcare is the goal, M4A is one proposal to reach that goal. Biden supports ending ""surprise billing"" where you go to an in network but then lab work or something else is done out of network without you knowing it and you get a ""surprise"" OON bill. He's going to allow importing prescription drugs from other countries to get the costs down. He is going to get a public option and subsidies for people who can't afford it. He is going to reempower Medicare to negotiate on more fronts that they were prohibited after Part D passed. 

What he won't do thankfully, is impose a federally run program on people who have insurance they want to keep and I'll tell you why that's good. Advocates for M4A point to countries like Canada as an example of a great working single payer system. But Canada doesn't have a large and politically active religious right like we have in the US. Those people don't want people to get abortions, IVF, birth control, the HPV vaccine for teen girls which has been shown to reduce cancer rates, they don't want people who are trans to be able to transition, and they often want to be able to send gay children to ""conversion camp"" to be ""cured"" through what amounts to torture. After 2016, Trump, McConnel, and Ryan were running the federal government. DO you want the federal government deciding what they will and will not pay for the next time people like that are running the government? I'm actually amazed the religious right isn't in favor of M4A because with the Hyde amendment already law, it would mean the end of abortion in this country, and could mean the end of many things that they also are against. 

M4A advocates point to Canada, but the public option works very well in countries like Germany and the Netherlands. SO don't tell me that a public option won't work when it, like single payer, works in other countries. It will get us universal healthcare, bring costs down, and not force people who want to keep their current plan to vote for trump to save their healthcare. 

Also, Sanders goes farther than other countries. He's saying he will abolish private insurance. Few, if ANY, countries have that. Canada has private insurance, as does Britain, as do Americans currently on Medicare. Canada doesn't cover dental or vision, but Sanders is saying it will. Which maybe it will, but he has to explain how he will fund it, and he's not even trying to with any specificity.

&gt; Biden has received incredible amounts of money from the mega rich, which means this campaign will owe those people and his policies will much more closely reflect their interests and not mine and my families, who are being crippled by unchecked capitalism.

That's simply not true. And in any case, Biden is proposing a Constitutional Ammendment to undo the Citizens United Case, a proposal which may be the most important legislation in 2020 to preserve a real democracy. He wants to have elections publicly funded. He is supporting policies that get the money OUT of politics and stops the super rich from having undue influence in politics. 

&gt; Biden supports and will implement more failed policy. He will give enormous tax breaks to my employer who will not increase my salary, he will give breaks to insurance companies that will raise my premiums, and breaks to the billionaire who owns my apartment complex who will intern raise my rent. 

This is so vague I'm not sure what you are referring to, but Biden is going to raise taxes on the wealthiest people. He's going to end the Trump tax cuts that have exploded the deficit, and more.

From his page, here's his plan on supporting union:

https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/

Here's some plans in a broader scope to help the middle class including supporting unions, infrastructure spending, developing underdeveloped areas, fight climate change and get to 100% clean energy, grants for start up businesses, and reinvest in economically depressed cities:

https://joebiden.com/infrastructure/

&gt; I, apparently, am not ""American enough"" to have my concerns addressed. 

What has Biden ever said to give you that impression?

&gt; Why should I support this campaign int the primary and not Bernie Sanders?

Well, no one can tell you who to support. I hope the info I've given you persuades you, but if it doesn't by all means follow your judgement and support Sanders in the primary. But don't sit out the general no matter what. If Biden is the nominee, you will not be forgotten. Biden knows what you're going through. As a child his family had to leave Scranton PA so his father could find work. It's a bit of a cliche at this point but it's the truth: Biden has lived economic hardship just like you're living now. He gets it, he's lived it. He won't leave you behind. If you consider the candidates and their proposals and decide on Sanders over Biden, I respect your choice. But if the election comes down to Biden vs Trump, there's a clear choice: Biden will help you, Trump will not. Trump knows NOTHING about the hardships your family is experiencing. Biden does. 

&gt; Make no mistake, if the Sanders crowd sits out the election vs Trump you will lose!!!! So can you tell me why we shouldn't? 

Because you will lose, too. If it's Biden vs Trump in November, and Trump wins, you and I will both lose. Trump winning isn't going to do a single thing to improve your life. All it will do is give you  sense of revenge against people who have a different plan to help you and help this country. Sanders supporters already sat out in large enough numbers to give us Trump, as well as Gorsuch and Kavanaugh as lifetime SCOTUS justice. Don't make that mistake again. 

&gt; And can you do it without saying ""well he isn't Trump""

Yes, for all the policy positions I've given above. But the fact is in November it will come down to Trump or the Democratic nominee. And if the nominee is Biden, then Biden is the clear choice. 

I don't think you really want 4 more years of the incompetence, the corruption, the tax cuts to the richest and nothing for the middle class, the juvenile nicknames, the chipping away at workers rights. I think you feel like I felt after NH, angry and disillusioned. I've since cooled off and was prepared to vote for Sanders over Trump even though I disagree with many of his policies and rhetoric. I think once you've had time to cool off you'll realize that Biden might not be your first choice, but if it is Trump vs Biden, you'll realize Biden is the right choice. Not Trump, not sitting out, not writing in ""FDR."" 

I hope this was helpful to you, and I applaud you reaching out and having this dialogue with us."
10647,"As far as I‚Äôm concerned, you don‚Äôt need to get excited for him if he‚Äôs the nominee. You just have to vote for him. You could be a Supreme Court voter instead. RBG can‚Äôt stay on the bench until 2025 when the next president is sworn in. Elections have consequences so if you care about any of that, be excited about voting for that. Or don‚Äôt.

Your second group leaves out a lot of reasoning to why people came to their conclusions amd sounds like you think they are stupid. Try learning how to 'steel man' your opponent's arguements instead pf writing them off as stupid. I'm sure there are several independent and non-voters that know why they didnt vote for Hilary or Trump.

10655,"It is space logic, I didn't think you'd understand that, but look at us, we've already come so far. I'm definitely going to miss not talking to you Lizzy, even if your last name sucks a lot harder than I do. And boy, do I have an unrealistic amount of suction."
10656,"Thanks for dropping by. A lot of us came from other candidates, and know the feeling.

I've become more and more impressed with Warren as time went on. If the race shook out differently, I could definitely see myself voting for her.

10670,"The conventions are pretty much set in stone. 

TBH, I don‚Äôt think those primaries are going to be all that consequential.  Biden is steamrolling Sanders and the longer the Trump Show goes on the more appealing Biden becomes. 

The math for Sanders is just not there. He has to win over 50% of the remaining delegates to even be close... with his waining popularity, that‚Äôs extraordinarily unlikely. 

It would be best for our country for Sanders to suspend his campaign and help Biden run against Trump."
10671,"Nah... There are plenty of sober Sanders supporters who listen to him rather than the lowest common denominator discourse on social media.

Empty barrels make the most noise. Don't judge all Sanders supporters by the loudest and most annoying ones on the internet. 

Plenty of people see Trump as an extreme danger. Plenty of Sanders supporters actually respect what he says himself about the priority of defeating Trump. 

In this light, a Biden/Sanders ticket would be a unifying influence on the millions of supporters of both.

Two professionals working in solidarity would bring the people to more solidarity.

A Biden/Sanders ticket would model unity between the camps. That would be a universe away from Trump's authoritarian control of the right-wing."
10672,"To save time, I'm going to quote [Paul Gastris's article](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/03/20/a-biden-warren-ticket-answering-the-doubters/) verbatim because he wrote a good refutation of these points:

1--First is the question of her age: Warren will be 71 in June. That‚Äôs actually not much older than Biden was when he assumed the vice presidency, nor Nelson Rockefeller: both were 66. I don‚Äôt remember anyone complaining about their ages. And women outlive men! To be sure, Warren paired with Biden, who turns 78 in November, does not exactly make a youthful tableau. But compared to what? In November, Donald Trump and Mike Pence will be 74 and 61 respectively. Younger, yes, but so much so that significant numbers of voters will make that the deciding factor? I doubt it.

2--There‚Äôs the worry that if Warren were to become vice president, Massachusetts‚Äô Governor Charlie Baker would replace her with a fellow Republican. Obviously, this is no small concern, since the senate is up for grabs in 2020 and whichever party controls it will control, among other things, the future makeup of the courts. But the threat here is less than meets the eye. Baker‚Äôs replacement would only serve for five months‚Äî[less](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-winning-the-white-house-could-cost-democrats-the-senate-at-least-temporarily/) if Warren were to resign from the senate earlier, after the November elections but before inauguration‚Äîat which point a special election would need to be held that Democrats are likely to win. Massachusetts Democrats can avoid even that risk by using their veto proof majority in the state legislature to pass a law [saying](https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2020/1/15/1911306/-How-Democrats-can-avoid-handing-Senate-seats-to-the-GOP-if-Warren-or-Sanders-wins-the-presidency?fbclid=IwAR0QJ3sRx4r_k4awrEEaXxpz0vZNGWVRQUJI7EPrXVTeMe9aH8o4L4VigvA) any senator appointed by the governor has to be from the same party as the previous senator‚Äîa law already on the books in a number of states. Boom, problem solved.

3--(Biden's already getting enough votes from the Northeast). But it seems to me that there is a bigger potential net upside to Biden picking a candidate who is at least acceptable, and perhaps highly attractive, to loyal Democratic voters on the left than one who might bring in voters on the center-right who are not traditional Democrats.

I would check out the article [his original articl](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/03/18/biden-should-pick-warren-as-vp-immediately/)e about Warren as VP."
10673,"&gt;A lot of people are saying a black person as VP...but Biden is extremely popular already with black communities

Also, at the end of the say Bernie, Biden, Warren, Pete, Amy would be signing the same bills, the ones that the Congress could get passes, and that means all of the bills would be more moderate, I have concerns Bernie would veto moderate bills for not going far enough which has done in the Senate."

Anyway, hello. üëã Just dropping by, you don't have to worry about this voter turning her back to voting in the GE. I do want to implore y'all: if Bernie doesn't make the nomination, please help us fight for progressive change. I think that is why emotions and passion are so high in our movement. Because there's a lot of things that need fixing in our country, and we don't want to go back to the status quo. So please, when you welcome any new Bernie supporters, let them know you're dedicated to helping, that you do care about progressive issues. (If you do care about progressive issues, not trying to put words in anyone's mouth.) 

We're scared because we don't want people deported. We don't want people locked in cages on the border, freezing and starving on the streets, locked away in jail because they can't afford bail. We're so much more alike than different. and the best way to win our allegiance is to help us fight for the human rights that we're worried are slipping from our fingers. If you get behind us and are willing to work with us, you'll combat our fears a lot quicker and more effectively, I think."

10713,"What I do judge is Bernie‚Äôs hesitance and inability to properly condemn his supporters. The Bernie bros are a symptom of the disease that is Bernie Sanders - divisiveness and irrationality.

10727,"Not OP, but another warren supporter. I switched to Bernie for a few days just because I thought he was the logical 2nd choice.... but I didnt feel it. What I liked most about warren aside from being a bold progressive and fierce fighter for the working class and less fortunate is her pragmatism. She fights the smart fight, she builds alliances and coalitions, and she has clout as someone who is respectable and gets shit done. Bernies heart was always in the right place, but his senate record is lacking. He gives good speeches and makes protest votes, and he certainly has a place in the debate, but I just dont see him as someone who can unilaterally push his massive expensive radical agenda through a congress with many Republicans and many moderates. Joe isn't as progressive as I'd like, and he has had bad votes and picked the wrong side in fights, but hes still progress, he will reverse trump and cement Obama's legacy for another decade, and I believe that he can rally progressives, moderates, and maybe a few moderate republicans to his side."
10728,"Yesterday on Twitter, one of his supporters (Tania Singh? as well as numerous others) shared an article on how the Bernie Bros are a myth, and then mocked people who said they were turned away from Sanders campaign because of how nasty his supporters are ‚ÄúSo you don‚Äôt care about healthcare or the poor because someone online was ‚Äúmean‚Äù to you?!‚Äù But my favorite is ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt paint all of us  one color because someone called you a name‚Äù.

10735,"Biden will need a big tent to win, but he can build that big tent through a variety of ways, not just through placating Bernie hold-outs.  The biggest groups of Bernie or Bust voters reside in bright blue states anyway.  They aren't worth an extensive GOTV effort. 

Biden should be more focused on those lifelong, middle-of-the-road, Rust Belt/Midwest democrats and independents who took a chance on Trump for whatever reason.  The ROI on flipping a small percentage of PA, MI, and WI voters is huge and will be the key to the election.  It's fun to talk about maybe flipping AZ or GA, but those states are meaningless if Biden can't take back states like PA and MI."

10744,"These aren't Super PACs though, let's be honest about this. Some of them are PACs yes, but a PAC is *a lot* different from a Super PAC. The key distinction in the context of this election and this debate about this topic is: a Super PAC may accept *unlimited* contributions from corporations. Regular PACs can not do that.

From [Campaign Legal Center](https://campaignlegal.org/update/pacs-super-pacs-dark-money-groups-whats-difference), a government watchdog group:



&gt; Super PACs and dark money groups¬†raise¬†and spend¬†substantial amounts of money¬†‚Äî often out pacing candidates‚Äô campaign committees ‚Äî intended to influence the outcome of U.S. elections. But these groups are all subject to different kinds of rules about fundraising and spendingTweet this quote., and raise different problems as voters attempt to follow the money.

***Super PAC***

&gt; Super PAC:¬†a political committee that meets the same threshold as any PAC of spending more than $1,000¬†to influence the outcome of a federal election and is thus required to register with the FEC.¬† ‚ÄúSuper PAC‚Äù is the shorthand for what the FEC refers to as independent expenditure-only political committee. What differentiates a Super PAC is that it may accept¬†unlimited¬†contributions from any non-foreign source, including union and corporate treasury funds.¬† It may spend unlimited amounts to influence the outcome of federal elections through independent expenditures.¬† However, it may not contribute directly to a candidate, and it may not coordinate with a candidate in making its expenditures.¬† The contributions and expenditures of a Super PAC are publicly disclosed on the FEC‚Äôs website.¬†

***PAC***

&gt; Political Action Committee (PAC):¬† a political committee that raises or spends more than $1,000¬†to influence the outcome of a federal election in a calendar year and is thus required to register with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).¬† A¬†PAC may accept a contribution of up to $5,000 per year¬†from any individual.¬† It may not accept union or corporate treasury funds.¬† A multicandidate PAC may contribute up to $5,000 per election to a candidate and $15,000¬†to a party committee.¬† It has no limit on the aggregate amount it may contribute. PACs established by corporations and labor unions, referred to as separate segregated funds (SSF), operate under slightly different rules,¬†e.g., a corporation or union may cover its SSF‚Äôs administrative expenses."

10761,"Trump sucks, and the last 4 years haven't been good, but it's not like the Obama/Biden years were some paradise.  Banks got bailed out while foreclosures rose and real wages stagnated.  Americans lost a lot of wealth during their administration.  On healthcare the ACA did some good, but it didn't go nearly far enough.  Plus, the watered down version that eventually got passed was a gift to the insurance and pharmaceutical industries because it didn't include any public option.  Not to mention a legally dubious drone war, and the loss of over 1,000 Democratic seats in state and local governments around the country.

If you think Trump came out of nowhere, then you're naive.  The Bush and Obama presidencies laid the groundwork for Trump's election, and Biden helped set the stage directly with his votes for trade deals, the Iraq War, and the bankruptcy bill, which have been hurting poor and working class people for decades now.

I mean, it's her business whoever she endorses, but her endorsement does not give me any pleasure at all, despite my strong personal support for Joe Biden as President."
10791,lol you get off easily huh
10792,"I've been re-watching Parks and Rec and I just watched this episode yesterday. It made me smile.

I also like to think that Leslie would be super proud of the positive, unifying campaign Joe is running."
10793,Good move!
10794,I absolutely adore both of them pretty equally.
10795,Typically after the nom is secured but it isnt unheard of to announce it early.
10796,:) Just thinking about all that malarkey that's gonna be defeated today
10797,"The interesting thing about framing it as a ""rally around the flag"" thing is that it's actually a really *low* bounce for that kind of thing. GWB's approval rating went up like 30 points after 9/11, and we're not seeing anything close to that here. So theoretically you have two likely reasons for that: a) Trump's just not getting nearly as much of a bounce as he *could* be getting if he had handled things correctly, or b) ""Rally around the flag"" effects are just getting dulled recently in the current political climate."
10798,What
10799,What up player
10800,üòî
10801,Just as friendly reminder to others.
10802,"I've had MSNBC on non stop for days, if they mentioned Biden, I didn't hear it"
10803,Check your state‚Äôs laws. I think some states allow you to vote under certain circumstances if you‚Äôre 17
10804,"Thank you for the kind words. The fight ain't over until Bernie concedes.

Please also understand most of the Bernie supporters have not lost sight of the bigger picture: To beat Trump and stand together with the rest of the D party behind the selected nominee."
10805,imo Booker best pick but I think very likely kamala
10806,"I really don't think he does. Biden has the elderly vote, but if half of the youth voted Bernie would crush Biden and Trump. Bernie doesn't need to convince biden supporters to vote for him, he needs to convince young voters to vote, period. 

If Biden gets the presidency we'll have the same system we have now with Trump, just with someone who can hide their incompetence much better. 

Honestly, Biden, Trump, the Clintons, they're ALL THE SAME. They're all wealthy elites with incentives to screw over the average person in order to line their pockets. Nothing changes if he's elected."
10807,"He already had two consecutive weeks of rough nights. He lost Minnesota, Massachusetts and Washington, states in which he was favored and he was thumped in Michigan, the state that gave his campaign a boost in 2016. From now on, it's an excercise in masochism for him. It's up to him to decide when enough is enough."
10808,"Biden only won a measly 3 states, while Bernard won 4 counties in total - 3 in Arizona, 1 in Illinois, and 0 in irrelevant low information red states that HE DOES NOT NEED SHUT UP ABOUT CUBA. 

You think 3 states can make up for winning 4 counties? This pathetic campaign will be finished soon, Sanders only needs 70% of the vote in New England states like Georgia and Louisianna, then you will learn how ""electable"" jOe bIdEn is just because he is leading national polls by like 30 points."
10809,"It was tough to hear, maybe I misinterpreted it. Still a bad call to bring it up in that context considering how uninformed most people are about semi-auto vs full."
10810,"As a both new (as of this primary) and old  (supported him in 2008 before Obama won the primary) supporter, I don‚Äôt entirely know how to fully defend Biden when people spam pages and links to things he may or may not have said and done throughout his life. It‚Äôs just overwhelming to try to fact check or reason out what‚Äôs true and what isn‚Äôt.

One of the most important things to me is that Biden has shown that he‚Äôs open to changing his viewpoint on something over time when confronted with evidence and public pressure. To me, that‚Äôs an extremely important ability in governing, way more than apparently having one set of beliefs that stubbornly never change your entire life."
10811,"Sanders isn't extreme left, true. He is a populist, that's the problem with him. He overpromises stuff he will never achieve while calling everybody not following his lead the enemy - including the people the Democratic candidate would need to win the general. 

&gt; If you don't like Sanders, you can't respect his power, and you can't think strategically. 

No. Not liking Sanders is deeply rooted in the fact that he runs a campaign on dividing people. It is a constant us vs. them. Biden runs on inclusion. Their two messages don't mix. 

&gt; People who are not right-wing may think Sanders is the best choice for VP. 

People might have lived in the sphere of rose twitter and CTH might believe that. 

&gt; Even if you don't like the idea, there are millions of people who would.

And there would be even more millions of people hating it. So no. Sanders will definitely not be the VP pick for Joe."
10812,Absolutely agree with you on that one.
10813,I mean I voted and I do vote.
10814,Cried... never ashamed to admit
10815,ü§õ respect.
10816,"So, let me get this straight. First you say the problem is Bernie's ""ego"", but then you switch to saying the problem is how his supporters have treated you?

Secondly, you &amp; the other commenters' conduct is actually pretty out of place even on this subreddit. Most people on here are taking a ""lift ourselves up, don't drag others down"" approach. Not you, though. /shrug

Just trying to make sense of all of this."
10817,You are AWESOME!
10818,"China has a huge army. I have been to China and it's mostly because they have such a large population that everybody needs jobs. There are policemen who wander around with nothing to do so they sweep the streets lol.

NATO is not really important anymore, I don't think many except America would miss it. Russia helped in the fight against Syria more than any other country, and America did nothing against Turkey so it's just a war exercise group for training. Russia spends so much because it is the largest country on earth by a far amount. Russia borders so many countries and has a lot of rivalries or: Chechnya and Uzbekistan. Russia also has to monitor its own airspace as NATO bases literally on every border in Russia lol.

If you consider this, America always designs and builds missiles. In response, Russia has to develop anti air missiles. This is why Russia's defense budget is actually justifiable. In the UK, our military mostly helps with flood defences of rural towns and villages, they're small but we rely on technology. I mean America spends billions to bomb targets without electricity, or targets using 20 year old American surplus equipment lol. 

Like I said, America spends because nobody else will. There's no demand, and in the face of this pandemic, all those trillions on missiles won't save you. France, Germany, etc, these countries have mandatory conscription. Even Russia does. It's military outlook is one of necessity, not excessiveness"
10819,"Woah, I forgot Gillibrand! That could be interesting. I liked her at first, even if she was never my favorite. I would‚Äôve liked to have seen more of her."
10820,"Bernie can pretend all he wants that he is running a clean campaign but by dragging this out he allows his surrogates to attempt any number of smears over the next couple months and because some Berners are delusional they actually believe that if they hurt Biden enough Bernie can still win. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs driving this and only this.

The big winner is Trump and there‚Äôs strong suggestions that Russia is also helping with this disinformation campaign. She may be a converted asset of them. dead serious. Read this:

10823,That's interesting. Sure it was MO and not MS? CNN wont call MO yet.

10826,Saaaaame.
10827,"Re not wanting to work with sanders because of ‚Äúhurt feelings‚Äù, it doesn‚Äôt just come from the trolls, they‚Äôre taking their cue from Bernie. He needs to work with people to pass his agenda. He doesn‚Äôt have a history‚Äôs of being able to work with many dems in the senate, let alone republicans. This has led him to be a very ineffective legislator. He has talked about these far left policies for decades and not made any progress on them. Other candidates actually have impressive legislative accomplishments because they were able to bring people to the table. Joe is bringing other dems into the fold to work with him, Bernie is not, he maintains that everyone else is the enemy because they lack his ideological purity. Just point to how badly he damaged his relationship with Warren, who essentially agrees with him on everything."
10828,So you think the 74% of black voters that vote for Biden are ‚Äúlow-info‚Äù?
10829,"He supports overall good policies (with the exception of foreign policy) but yea i think he hurts us in down-ballot votes. I honestly think both he and Biden will probably be able to beat Trump, but i'm far less confident about Bernie, and we lose ground in the senate with him as well i think"
10830,"I understand why you don‚Äôt want to use this sort of negative language about Bernie, believe me I do, but I can‚Äôt overlook the fact that what he‚Äôs doing is so dangerous and irresponsible. Not only is he dampening turnout for the democratic candidate (again), but he‚Äôs endangering the lives of people who will continue to have to go out in or see to vote during a pandemic even though his chances of wining are effectively 0%. Can we ignore this behavior for ‚Äúunity?‚Äù"
10831,I sure hope so. I‚Äôll be donating to Mark Kelly and other Dems in tight races to make it happen.
10832,"It never *has* to be a member of a particular community. Remember, the main role of the Vice President is someone who can become president if necessary. Choosing people based on race and gender is simply a disservice to America. Also, choosing someone who‚Äôs demographic meshes with your goals doesn‚Äôt really make much difference in votes. Picking someone bad, like when McCain picked Palin, can hurt you. Harris is toxic to a lot of people we need to win. I highly doubt that you‚Äôre going to have a turnout issue because you pick Tammy Duckworh, a war hero and capable senator, or Emanuel Cleaver, a successful congressman who was Mayor of Kansas City."
10833,"I disagree, I think it's a really vocal minority. This Bernie or bust thing was statistically proven a myth in 2016. The vast majority of them voted for Hillary then (even more than Hillary 08 voters who voted for Obama), and I think they'll do the same again this year. 

But regardless, what does demonizing them accomplish? Listening, empathizing, and making Joe Biden's case is a better strategy. We cannot just expect to say ""uhh, you want Trump?"" and expect it to be enough. We can't use that excuse again, we already went through this scenario in 2016. 

Can't use excuses of ""oh if these few thousand people voted, things would have been different"", no more of this woulda, coulda, shoulda nonsense. We have to guarantee that Joe will win against Trump, and that means bringing out enough turnout, driving up enthusiasm. 

We can't do that with alienating voters, and we certainly can't afford to do that."
10834,"Yeah, in the UK Labour Party, we have had similar problems with Corbyn supporters being incredibly toxic abusing other members.

We lost countless amounts of votes because of toxic members abusing MPs and the public.  I felt like an odd one out sometimes, but please make sure you hold your fellow BernieBros (and Gals) to account and make sure they don't divide the democrats even further."
10835,The Dow Jones... Never seen that before....
10836,Chasten-style glasses would look good on you. :-)
10837,I actually agree but hope Warren has a good Cabinet position regardless that‚Äôs well suited to her focus on reform.
10838,"The border camps need to close, healthcare needs to be expanded, we need to re-join our allies in fighting climate change. Biden is not the perfect candidate, but he's a step to the left. 

Destroying the system bc their candidate isn't doing well will only hurt more people that they claim to be fighting for. People are suffering now and our country is suffering now."
10839,"Jeez, if S.C. comes first, I think he runs the table."
10840,"I disagree 

In fact I think we should strongly disavow socialism, we don‚Äôt need Bernie supporters - they don‚Äôt vote and they aren‚Äôt democrats. We need real Americans who align to our democratic values. We stick with who we are we will win running away - that‚Äôs why Trump and Russia want Bernie to win. 

I‚Äôm not interested in entertaining Bernies trolls, I‚Äôm a little surprised the mods haven‚Äôt given you the boot

If you‚Äôre interested in being a democrat, we all united under Joe - so thats your choice"
10841,hes defiantly not racist which is pretty cool
10842,"Good, please keep the comments coming, and if anyone has an idea on who a good pick would be."
10843,2 million voted in 2016 primary. So it‚Äôs gonna be down this year due to Corona.
10844,I think they took it down or its not working because I don't see anything under community options when i tried
10845,"I cut and paste this particular section of Biden‚Äôs policies more than any other. This is about halfway through his [Criminal Justice policy:](https://joebiden.com/justice/)

&gt;**End all incarceration for drug use alone and instead divert individuals to drug courts and treatment.** Biden believes that no one should be imprisoned for the use of illegal drugs alone. Instead, Biden will require federal courts to divert these individuals to drug courts so they receive treatment to address their substance use disorder. He‚Äôll incentivize states to put the same requirements in place. And, he‚Äôll expand funding for federal, state, and local drug courts.

&gt;**Expand other effective alternatives to detention.** The Biden Administration will also take an evidence-based approach to increase federal funding for other alternatives-to-detention courts and related programs for individuals convicted of non-violent crimes, such as veterans courts and youthful offender courts.

&gt;**Use the president‚Äôs clemency power to secure the release of individuals facing unduly long sentences for certain non-violent and drug crimes.** President Obama used his clemency power more than any of the 10 prior presidents. Biden will continue this tradition and broadly use his clemency power for certain non-violent and drug crimes.

And to particularly address your concern about not being able to pay the fine, this is a couple paragraphs lower:

&gt;**End cash bail:** Cash bail is the modern-day debtors‚Äô prison. The cash bail system incarcerates people who are presumed innocent. And, it disproportionately harms low-income individuals. Biden will lead a national effort to end cash bail and reform our pretrial system by putting in place, instead, a system that is fair and does not inject further discrimination or bias into the process.

&gt;**Stop jailing people for being too poor to pay fines and fees:** Some people end up unable to escape our justice system because of the very fines and fees that the system levies. Biden will use the grantmaking power of the federal government to incentivize the end of policies that incarcerate people for failing to pay fines and fees. He‚Äôll also target policies to revoke driver‚Äôs licenses for unpaid parking or speeding tickets. And, he‚Äôll help individuals incarcerated for six months or longer get a true fresh start by incentivizing states to wipe clean any outstanding traffic fines or fees that would prevent them from obtaining a license. These license-related reforms will not apply to licenses revoked for driving while intoxicated, reckless driving, or other serious driving violations."
10846,Yikes
10847,"Tomorrow is going to be 4/4 states for Biden, and by big margins."
10848,Just voted for Joe in Texas!
10849,Don‚Äôt ever expect a United dem party after Bernie Sanders. A whole generation of progressives will never forget and vote accordingly.
10850,"Here is some helpful data.

The problem with the youth vote strategy is there is twice as many 30 to 100 year olds as there are 18 to 30 and they vote twice as much.  So its a 4x advantage.  This idea that a bunch of people showing up in one place is indicative of how the voting will go is really misguided.  80 year olds don't need a rally to get them to vote.

Pete brought out the best in a bunch of us and mobilized folks who felt put off from traditional political wrangling. I'm looking forward to working and voting for him again in the future, but now I'm following his lead and helping out Biden!"
10853,"I see it this way, Biden's age is a plus to people because it equals years of experience at getting the right things done - having someone of colour on the ticket means they have real and direct experience of the problems POC in USA face and can provide insight on all major decisions from that perspective. 

Between the 2 leaders you want as many Americans feeling confident in the countries direction as possible I think"
10854,"Pritzker gave off a bit of a slimeball vibe to me during his campaign, but I‚Äôm happy to say I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong about the man. What a great governor he‚Äôs been for that state."
10855,"It's Barack Obama, dude."
10856,"I get you man, but it's easy to get expectations too high and be naive. I'm sure Sanders has people's interest in heart, but I'm sceptical if he could actually pull off most of his ideas even if he beats Trump. You see, American politicians and, to be fair, most of citizens aren't too keen on anything labeled as socialism so, at best, Bernie's policies when put to reality would probably be heavily watered down.

Also I could be wery wrong, but that's just my opinion, an outsider's one too."
10857,"&gt; It really makes me think that it's a Russian operation to smear Joe

So in other words, wait for the WaPo or NYT?"
10858,"Trump will use anything. May i remind you that the entire e-mail thing was 100% bs? Those were unfounded accusations, magnified by media coverage (NO OTHER TOPIC WAS GIVEN MORE COVERAGE by the media in 2016 election) (talk about media being biased in favor of Clinton by the way...). FBI investigation was launched and TWICE came to a conclusion no charges should be filed. So it was an accusation that Trump repeated a thousand times to cover up his own lack of tax returns. Hillary never did anything wrong, nothing was even proven.

My point here is that Trump will use conspiracy theories, because they are popular with his own base as well as with ""Bernie or bust"" people who lended him his support in 2016 and are unfortunately likely to do it again in 2020. Trump will always find something. So we should not be looking for 100% ""clean"" candidate, because such candidate does not exist. Bernie would just be labeled a communist, his claims about Cuba and USSR turned against him. Right-winged propaganda machine will use anything as its fuel, and will target anyone who stands for progressive principles. 

It's in fact cowardly to say that we should be looking for candidates Trump cannot attack with 100% FALSE ACCUSATIONS because that's how we lose. He's always going to make up some lie about anyone so i guess it'd be better not to contest him at all if we were so afraid of fake controversy. Joe will crush him with facts."
10859,He won some counties by getting literally 20 more votes.
10860,"I don't think he will, as is his right to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't urge him to drop out, but I'd urge him to stop with the attacks. Attacking Biden at that point is only for the purpose of aiding Trump. Why attack Joe Biden in a primary that's already his?"
10861,"Wow 12 bucks between 12 charities. I guess when Jane isn‚Äôt making 15% off the grift they ask for less money :/. 

Whereas joe works with actual knowledgeable experts unlike Sanders who consulted‚Ä¶ Who is that? Rashida Talib? Yeah we want her leader ship in these times of crisis LMAO

Cut it out Putin. Yalls time is up"
10862,There's nothing to debate: Sanders lost.
10863,"It‚Äôs also fair to point out that stimuluses are almost always unfair?

Cutting taxes benefits the wealthy more than the poor. The goal of a stimulus is to goose the economy, this can be done even if things aren‚Äôt perfectly fair"
10864,"Joe Biden supported the disastrous Iraq War which cost trillions of dollars, thousands of American lives and a half million dead Iraqi civilians. But sure, he supported gays once that became politically advantageous so I guess that's worth something."
10865,"""shall not be infringed"""
10866,"Well, that‚Äôs the most important thing, IMO.  But I like the fact that he isn‚Äôt going to I like his plan to alleviate the student loan crisis.  I paid off almost 200 K of student loans and really got irritated at Warren and Bernie‚Äôs plans to just wipe out all student loans.  I think paying off loans with volunteer work and free community colleges are an excellent idea.  Also, his attempts to help the middle class is very important to me.  The American middle class used to be the envy of the world, but under both Obama and Trump it really got attacked.  I also, believe strong unions are important to create a strong middle class.  But I also believe unions need to be kept in check.  The Teachers Union is detrimental to the US education system.  There needs to be a balance.  I also like that he will help Dreamers.   But I also believe we need strong borders.  I looked into immigrating to New Zealand, a liberal democracy in many ways more liberal al than us, but it‚Äôs immigration policies are much more restrictive than ours.  We need to have similar restrictions.  Compassionate, yet restrictive policies.  There‚Äôs nothing wrong with giving preference to immigrants with skills and talents we as a nation can use."
10867,Yep. Both Bernie and Joe need to be careful. It's much deadlier in people aged 60+.
10868,Beggars cant be choosers I guess....

10871,Nationalized healthcare would not have prevented this from happening.  Nationalized healthcare doesn't magically make personal protective gear and ventilators appear.  Joe has already said that testing and treatment for the virus should be covered.
10872,"Because Bernie is just going to use it as another opportunity to fling shit and hurt Biden's chances against Trump like he did with Hillary in 2016 and how he did in the last debate. At this point Biden is running against Trump, and Republicans and is trying to unify the party, Bernie is still running against Joe Biden and trying to divide the party to try to prop himself up to win a few additional delegates. Bernie can fling as much shit as he wants, and Biden is hamstrung in responding to this, as he is trying to be the adult in the room and win a General Election. And Bernie shamefully knows this and exploits it to prop himself up. Biden shouldn't even humor Bernie, Biden shouldn't even give Bernie a platform, Biden should skip this debate and let Bernie shrivel up in electoral irrelevance as he gets blown out by way worse margins than he did in 2016."
10873,Fair enough.
10874,"I was a Buttigieg supporter but I donated $4 to Bernie early in his campaign and was bombarded with texts every day to donate. Okay, fine. Then after Iowa i started getting texts painting Pete in a bad light and talking about how he was in the hands of Billionares. I blocked those numbers after that. I couldn't believe how they painted another candidate who genuinely wants to help the country and had a vision to do so. The world isnt so black and white that you are right and everything else is wrong. Severely turned off by his campaign after that.

If he does get the nomination i will vote for him, but nothing before that."
10875,"I just saw that this sub has adopted Pete's Rules of the Road. As a Pete supporter who is now #TeamJoe, you honestly don't know how much that means to us. That was very thoughtful!"
10876,When he brought up a decades whole hyper-technical example of a time Biden discussed cutting social security he completely lost me. Now is not the time for gatchas that are extremely misleading and do not represent either candidates view or policy.

Pete and Warren were my top two, but Biden's ascension is undeniable, the math behind his victory is clear, and yesterday's speech was so presidential I couldn't stop smiling."

It may be progressive vs moderate for the most part now, but post-primary I agree, we have one opponent and that's Trump and we need to find ways to come together against him."

WASHINGTON ‚Äî Congressional Democrats are very familiar with the political dramaturgy now playing out in their party‚Äôs White House primary and know of its lessons and consequences.

Voters appear to be in a death match between those who crave an aggressively progressive policy agenda with little tolerance for dissent and more moderates whose central goal is to undermine the populist movements in both parties and defeat Donald J. Trump. Both believe theirs is the winning formula to unseat President Trump.

On Super Tuesday, this was playing out at the presidential level across the country between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. But it played out at the congressional level as well. On Tuesday, Jessica Cisneros in Texas, the highest profile primary challenger of the Justice Democrats, a very progressive group, lost to the moderate Democratic incumbent, Henry Cuellar. Left-wing-activist-backed Senate candidates in Texas and North Carolina were crushed by more moderate candidates.

The first dress rehearsal for this battle was the 2018 midterm elections, when the Justice Democrats put its muscle behind nearly 80 Sanders-like insurgent candidates to target House seats, many of them held by less liberal Democratic incumbents. That year, scores of Democrats ranging from left of center (like Katie Porter of California) to fairly conservative (Anthony Brindisi of New York) took advantage of waning support for Mr. Trump in America‚Äôs suburbs to make a run for House seats held by Republican incumbents.

The results were pretty unequivocal. Justice Democrats lost virtually every primary race in 2018 when they fielded a homegrown liberal candidate, but they won one very important race: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez upset Representative Joe Crowley in a New York seat he had held for years.

At the same time, scores of middle-of-the-road Democrats were able to get through crowded primaries and win over Republican and independent voters in the general election, giving their party a net gain of 40 seats and flipping the House.



The theory of the case for progressive candidates is that they galvanized the Democratic base, and if people would just give them a chance, they will force through policies that most of the country supports. But the data ‚Äî and many of the experiences of the 116th Congress ‚Äî tell a more nuanced story.

A 2019 Gallup poll found that from 1994 to 2018, the percentage of all Democrats who call themselves liberal had more than doubled, to 51 percent from 25 percent. But Gallup also found that between 1993 and 2016, the percentage of Americans identifying as conservative rested between 36 percent and 40 percent, holding at 35 percent in 2018.

Looked at another way, in this Congress, the size of the Progressive Caucus, representing the House‚Äôs most liberal members, reached historic size ‚Äî just under 100 of the chamber‚Äôs 235 Democrats ‚Äî but the New Democrat Coalition, a more moderate group, also grew to historic levels, to roughly 100 members.

Part of the issue is definitional. Socially liberal but fiscally conservative is now far too pat a description for contemporary moderate Democrats, many of whom would be to the left of the last Democratic president, Barack Obama.

Max Rose of Staten Island, a typical freshman who picked off a Republican in 2018, is a veteran who was awarded a Purple Heart and Bronze Star in Afghanistan. He cares little about the deficit and is strongly against the Green New Deal. Like the vast majority of freshman Democrats who won in 2018, he does not like Medicare for All, but he supports a public option on the Affordable Care Act‚Äôs insurance exchanges, which was considered a far left position not so long ago. He and the rest of the freshman Democrats support abortion rights, which was not true for many moderates before this class.

Further, racial and geographic dynamics often get conflated with generational ones among Democratic voters.

The 2018 races illuminated this as well. The Ocasio-Cortez victory was considerably more complicated than the postelection analysis, which focused almost completely on shifting demographics in her district. While the narrative of her victory portrayed younger, nonwhite and working-class voters as her secret base, in reality Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had soundly beaten the incumbent in the areas of the district that were by and large more wealthy and educated, in particular parts of Queens filled with white residents fleeing overpriced Manhattan.

Mr. Crowley prevailed in most working-class corners of the district, including the district‚Äôs Hispanic and African-American enclaves; he beat Ms. Ocasio-Cortez by more than 25 points in her own Parkchester section of the Bronx.

David Freedlander neatly summed this up in his analysis for Politico magazine soon after the race: ‚ÄúOcasio-Cortez, the young Latina who proudly identifies as a democratic socialist, hadn‚Äôt been all but vaulted into Congress by the party‚Äôs diversity, or a blue-collar base looking to even the playing field. She won because she had galvanized the college-educated gentrifiers who are displacing those people.‚Äù

In short, deeply blue areas, especially with young and affluent voters, may be seeking political representation far to the left of the Democrats who were once easily re-elected. But as scores of Democrats saw in 2018, and still more saw on Super Tuesday, much of the rest of the country‚Äôs Democrats, especially older African-American voters who are a major component of the base, prefer more centrist candidates. This is the dichotomy that hangs over the party today.

The 116th Congress also demonstrated that political influence outside of Washington does not always translate into legislative victories, as progressives are promising.

Without question Ms. Ocasio-Cortez‚Äôs influence on the Democratic Party also is striking in modern politics for a freshman House member. In her first few months in office she got normally skittish Democrats and some early presidential candidates to sign on to her Green New Deal (introduced with Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts), forced a national conversation about marginal tax rates and Medicare for All, helped tank a plan for Amazon to move to Queens, and catalyzed a vast rejection of corporate PAC money for incumbents who had just a year ago eschewed that plan as impractical at best, unilateral disarmament at worst.

But here was the reality for progressives: Medicare for All got little more than a hearing or two, while the House passed bill after bill pressing more incremental health care changes (but none of which the Republican-controlled Senate would even entertain). The Green New Deal had a messy if high-profile roll out, then fizzled. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez did not have even the modest legislative victories enjoyed by other freshman Democrats like Joseph Neguse of Colorado, Deb Haaland of New Mexico and Lauren Underwood of Illinois, who ran on getting health care bills on the floor.

What is more, many Democrats began to fret early on that the far left was going to do to them what the Tea Party had done to Republicans a few years back: Run them out of town, one primary at a time. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez previously suggested that Democrats who were not sufficiently loyal to an emergent brand of progressive politics should have others like her run against them in a primary. She is now suggesting that, exit polling be damned, Mr. Biden‚Äôs latest string of successes is because of the strong-arming of corporate lobbyists, something Mr. Sanders has underscored by repeatedly calling Mr. Biden the establishment candidate.

But the results speak for themselves. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez threw her weight behind Cristina Tzintz√∫n Ramirez in her Senate primary campaign in Texas to defeat the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee‚Äôs chosen candidate, M.J. Hegar. Ms. Hegar ended up easily outpacing a crowded Democratic field.

‚ÄúThere are some people who one don‚Äôt really seem to understand the math of the majority making,‚Äù said Representative Abigail Spanberger, a former intelligence office, whose Richmond-area district had been held by Republicans for decades. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some people that just think that we‚Äôre out of touch and that if we just worked hard, more Democrats would come out of the woodwork, and so we should just try to say to all the things that excite all the Democrats. You can say that until you‚Äôre blue in the face, but there are just not that many Democrats in my district.‚Äù"
10906,"27 year old Progressive Warren turned Biden supporter. If my state had it already had its primary, I would vote for Biden now that she's dropped out.  Going to get into the volunteering game in the next week or so."
10907,"I don't think Europeans can truly understand how absolutely zero of a chance someone like Bernie would have in a general election here. We don't elect our president with a popular vote. He has to win states, and there are many, many states in which Bernie's policies are deeply unpopular. He also has severe issues with details that would have come out in a general election. He wants socialized medicine, but doesn't even come close to proposing a viable way to pay for it. Trump would have savaged him in the debates over this."
10908,I tell gun nuts they are full of shit all the time too. Any time a person mentions gun safety they scream we are trying to take all their guns! They are delusional and need to be deprogrammed from NRA propaganda. If you think Biden showing some fire and shutting down an asshole in Michigan hurt him then you are wrong.

10911,"I love the Democrats for the fact that every four years I, an Anarchist, can stand shoulder to shoulder with you, the political equivalent of the cream in an oreo and we find common ground.

I've always looked for pragmatic candidates just for this reason. It's not that I want MY WAY to win... I've just always wanted a seat at the table. That's what Joe is saying... We are building bridges."
10912,"&gt;She also had terrible favorability throughout the campaign (and her career for that matter).

I'm full-on Team Joe but I gotta defend my girl Hill here too. Her favorability has been incredibly high whenever she hasn't been actively running for public office (except it never recovered after the 2016 loss). 

Even through the Benghazi bs she had upwards of 90% approval from Democrats and enough Indepdendent/GOP support to keep her favorability in the 60-70% range. It wasn't until the start of the 2016 primary that it started to dip, especially when Sanders was able to effectively get (baseless and untrue) smears about her being corrupt to stick. 

Hopefully Joe won't get hit by (or will be able to deflect) those same smears when Sanders inevitably goes into full-on rage mode and tries to destroy him, but it's entirely possible that he gets hurt similarly to Hillary. He's got one advantage here that she didn't, or more accurately she had a disadvantage that he didn't: and that's sexism. People hate to admit it but all the shit about her being ""inauthentic"" was pretty thinly veiled and wouldn't be as effective against a male candidate."

10940,"Yeah I'm seeing a couple people on here who don't think a black woman should be VP, but luckily the deeply racist liberal is fairly rare. Disaffected Rs who are so racist they wouldn't vote for a ticket with a black woman are probably pretty rare too. Most people who want Trump gone decided to vote blue in 2020 three years ago. What's *not* rare is the unenthused democrat, or apathetic left leaning indie. Those are the people we need to mobilize, and a dynamic, interesting, inspiring woman of color would make that happen. Obama was my first ever vote, and let me tell you young people were jazzed, everyone was dying to vote for him. That kind of mobilization far outweighs the rare Trump hater who just hates black people even more. Most people who hate black people that much love Trump.

It is NOT an issue of turning people into democrats, it's an issue of turning out the vote. Trump's approval doesn't budge, and his base votes. We just need to show up, and give people something worth showing up for."
10941,"I'm talking about the trolls and bots (who repeat the exact same line multiple times in comments) who pile on slandering Joe Biden. I'm not talking about ordinary Sanders supporters. The sudden fall in Sanders content and upvotes to Sanders posts when he pulled his ad budget is pretty strong evidence that a very large chunk of pro-Sanders activity on Reddit and Twitter is paid for advocacy.

It's possible to be a good person supporting a cause that is also supported by paid groups or by bad people. It doesn't mean you are bad or that other Sanders supporters are bad, but you being good doesn't mean everyone else is too."

10946,"&gt;Do you think black voters will be more motivated this election?

Absolutely. Clinton was a hypothetically strong candidate in that demo but underperformed in turnout; I think complacency was big here. After 8 years of Obama and Clinton leading all the polls they assumed she had it in the bag and weren't motivated. 

Now with Trump in office being an existential threat to everything they stand for, they aren't going to take anything for granted. Joe, like Clinton, is already strong with black voters, but the '16 loss is going to make them mobilize like hell.

&gt; Do you think white suburban voters have left Trump? 

This is harder to know for sure since they aren't as unified politically as black voters tend to be. But the 2018 midterms and early results in the 2020 primary show that they have. 41 pickups in the House were largely due to suburban voters in purple districts. And suburban voters in VA in particular came in huge for Biden yesterday"
10947,"The reason Biden had to go (almost) all in on SC in terms of early states is because his campaign was hurting for funding. They focused what they had where they could get the most momentum. 

Also, it's not as if Sanders campaign didn't campaign hard in SC. *They did.* Bernie reached striking distance [in the polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/south-carolina/) up until the last week. 

&gt;Biden's support in SC was black peeps over 45.

He also won the majority of white voters and every self ascribed category from moderate to very liberal.

10949,"I flitted between several candidates (including Warren)...ended up on Joe because of some of my older relatives...the types you are paying attention to.

He does have quite a few legitimately good policies that twitter ""snarkers"" tend to overlook...and some are surprisingly progressive. If you are interested, read up on his plans on HBCUS...He wants to implement Bobby Scott's SAFE act, too, and even expand on it. .

Another thing that does make me feel good about Joe is he doesn't hold grudges...and he's willing to build coalitions and listen to other people and admit when he's fucked up. I know he and Warren have had their beefs in the past, but allegedly (and I wish I could find the link) back in 2015 when he was thinking of running he even asked her to a meeting and approached her for ideas and offered a VP.  So I wouldn't be shocked if he listened to her seriously, not just as an olive branch sort of thing, and offered her a cabinet position...although I want her as Senate Majority Leader myself."

I haven't looked into the numbers for Joe, but at one point when Bernie was making a stink about Pete's fundraising fundraising, I checked and saw that Bernie had taken more money from Exxon than Pete.

Of course, I don't think this means Bernie is doing Exxon's bidding. Nor was Pete. Nor is Joe. It means various employees of these companies/sectors, from gas station attendants on up, donated to the campaigns as individuals. There's just nothing nefarious about it, but using ""so-and-so got X money from Y corporation"" is a very common populist trick to paint opponents as corrupt when they're not.

The main base of reliable dem voters are well-educated moderate south Floridians, some of the more liberal snowbirds, and black voters, all demographics that have reliably voted moderate. They're also all aware that the big swing vote in Florida is the Cuban population here, and I don't even have to explain why they don't like Bernie."

11017,"Biden's VP should be someone covering his weaknesses to bring in more votes; having a black women won't help much as Biden has already gotten the black votes as we have seen.

Someone young and fresh but still a POC like Andrew Yang would be better fit, considering that Yang has a diverse following from ex-Berners to ex-Trump voters to independents to previously-politically-apathetic voters. Biden's weakness is now the youth and more progressive voters; something that Yang can also achieve considering how Yang was 2nd choice for many Bernie and Warren supporters; so he can rally those voters into Biden in the general too.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Both Biden and Yang seem to exchange phone calls with one another like every 1-2 weeks, most recently early last week. However Yang isn't endorsing anyone yet unless they adopt UBI in their policies. 

Now if you are skeptical of Biden adopting UBI, consider that Harvard economics Professor Jason Furman, a former top Obama economics advisor, espoused UBI days ago to help combat the economic effects of the coronavirus: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-for-a-big-coronavirus-stimulus-11583448500](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-for-a-big-coronavirus-stimulus-11583448500) 

So presumably both Furman and Biden would had worked together before, and he may be in a better position to convince Biden to work things out with Yang."

11021,"This was my feeling a year or two ago but given Biden's age there's a significant chance he only serves one term. The VP could very well be the nominee in 2024. With that in mind, I'd gladly take Harris on the ticket."

11032,"&gt;It is more of Biden's presidency being the first incremental step and foundation for the vision of what I want.


What do you want? How are you so certain that Biden can create any solid foundation when the 8 years of Obama's have been completely undone by 4 years of Donald? What exactly do you envision from a Biden presidency realistically? 

&gt;And, please know that....ALL of the Democratic candidates have the shared goal and progressive vision of more &amp; bigger government intervention/role to make the society more equitable. (Just different approaches)

This seems like a Republican talking point about progressivism being nothing but bigger government rather than it being a smarter government. Do you really consider yourself a progressive?

&gt;That vision is not something Sanders or Warren have a monopoly on.

What is the vision here though with Biden? How is he the best candidate to make any change whatsoever when we've already witnessed the lack of substantial change from Obama and Biden's administration thanks to a completely obstructionist Republican party? How can we expect him to bring any of them to the table when they're plotting to have him and his son investigated for a made up conspiracy theory?"
11033,They‚Äôve already started their desperation push of the BS accusations. I want to just get it over with.
11034,"LOOOOOOLL

look at this man not being able to defend his viewpoints"
11035,"The presupposition is that the media wasn't biased in the past, which is not true.  If you want to get a full spectrum of the news I would suggest the NY Times and Washington Post and take what is reported on today that happened to day with caution.  The media is trying to feed our lust for information and they get it wrong to often but I think the papers often get it right after a day or two.  MSNBC, although very left leaning seems to get more things right and isn't a propaganda machine like Fox is."
11036,"His ""Think Tank"""
11037,"Howdy. I think it‚Äôs safe to say that Biden was not the first (or second, maybe) choice for most of us; the subreddit has tripled in membership over the last couple of weeks, as candidates dropped out. I was not at all amped about a Biden presidency, but reading his policies through made me feel a lot better. I‚Äôd read some before, but had no reason to do a deep dive until Biden was, you know, the only option left. I was very relieved when I finally went through the whole website, pleasantly surprised, even.

So, he wants $15 minimum wage, universal pre-k and community college and trade schools, decriminalization of marijuana and expulsion of marijuana-related offenses, increased funding for mental health and addiction services, an end to incarceration for drug use, repeal of Citizens United and right to work legislation, a carbon tax, a ban on new fracking operations, and he‚Äôs recently adopted Sanders‚Äô College for All (families who make less than 125k) plan and Warren‚Äôs bankruptcy plan.

All that checked important boxes for me (even if I wish he‚Äôd just legalize marijuana and full-on end fracking, I realize what he‚Äôs proposing has a way better chance of getting passed exactly as-is, and it is an improvement). In more exciting news, he‚Äôs pushing a high-speed rail plan and $100b investment in improving public schools in his [Infrastructure policy](https://joebiden.com/infrastructure/), a plan for LGBTQ equality ‚Äúin America and the World,‚Äù and his healthcare plan, while not perfection, is easily a massive improvement over what we have.

His [plan for Rural America](https://joebiden.com/rural/) addresses rural hospital closures, modernization of farms to help farmers, has a $20b investment in providing internet access to rural areas, and weaves in expertly with his climate plan.

Since you‚Äôre a Bernie guy, you‚Äôre probably going to want to see [the Biden Plan for Strengthening Worker Organizing, Collective Bargaining, and Unions](https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/)

And honestly, I was impressed and relieved to read his [government reform plan.](https://joebiden.com/governmentreform/) It is far more expansive and right-on than I thought it would be.

Anyway, there‚Äôs a start. I wasn‚Äôt looking to become a Biden stan, but the more I perused his policies, the more excited I got. There will be massive improvements (and progress!) with a Biden presidency, which was a huge relief for me."
11038,"Go to the right (only on browser, and not on old reddit) and click on community options under the create a new post button."
11039,Nope. He basically made fun of Joe during a debate. They are not simpatico.
11040,"No but I listened to his campaign manager yesterday who basically said a huge part of his campaign was rolling out a new voter data analysis software to bequeath to the person who was likely to win the nomination.

I also know enough, having been involved in politics what OFA did in '08 versus what Clinton in '16 refused to do in how they reached out to voters. Let me just say, there's  big reasons why she did so terrible in the rust belt"
11041,Supporters of the leading candidate are more enthusiastic than the supporters of the runner up? Colour me surprised...
11042,Biden has been withstanding attacks from Trump since the start of his campaign. Bernie has gotten nothing but praise from Trump for the last few weeks. Who is coming out on top despite the pressure to fail? Biden.
11043,"Well welcome. We are pleased  to have you here. I too like Liz. She is one classy woman. I have a feeling she will be a big part of Joe's administration should he win. Joe would be smart to include her.

Freedom of speech matters. Ideas matter. Let the people support the media they want. Biden over Bernie. Ideas over authoritarianism."
11048,"Sorry about that, the Sanders people have been horrible to everyone. They are especially bad when your candidate drops out. 

The best thing to do is report them and move on. Don‚Äôt give them air and maybe the movement will suffocate."
11049,"I am supporting Joe from a place of ideals, not fear. Yes, I do support depoliticizing the Supreme Court by adding more justices and making 5 of them selected by the other 10 (Pete's plan). I am supporting Joe out of the ideal that the future of this country is one that everyone feels that can be a part of. Where we can make meaningful progress by uniting, not dividing, and working for change that matters - such as paying everyone a living wage, or fighting climate change head on by not only reducing emissions now but also investing in technologies for a sustainable future. The problems that matter to you matter to me and they matter to a majority of Americans. It isn't fair to say that if they don't agree with you on everything they're voting out of fear or have been ""corrupted by the establishment."" The future of the Democratic Party is a big tent with a wide open door: if you believe the country can be better than it is right now, more equitable, more sustainable, more just, the Democratic Party has a place for you. Even people who might have voted Republican in the past. It's not ""sweeping, possibly impractical, changes now or nothing,"" it's working together taking steps and strides to make this country better. I encourage you to read Joe's policies and you might be surprised to learn that he and your candidate have more in common than you think."

11062,This applies to Bernie since he also joined.
11063,"&gt; Also, 30% or less?

Yeah, that number is wrong. RCP says [36.4%](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html). It's clearly over, though."
11064,"Joe's plan to reach 100% emissions free by 2050 is too late by all scientific estimates. I would have been for nuclear plants if it was 30 years ago, but a new nuclear facility takes decades to be funny operational. Continuing fracking is an environmental disaster. The fossil fuel industry owes the US and the rest of the world reparations for the damage they've done to the environment not just a tax on the continued destruction of the environment. 

College graduates by far aren't wealthy, they're working class. A four year degree isn't even a guarantee of a good life anymore, it's merely the basic qualification for a career outside of the trades.If you look at most state colleges you'll see the states contribute less than ever and force the students to make up the difference."
11065,"This is true - though Id argue party lines are no longer as relevant and telling as before. Generally Id side with Republicans, but after seeing how they've been acting recently Im not about to support them in any way.

11070,"Eh, I think that's a huge deal on Twitter but not as much in real life. IMO all told Bernie's been a force for good by normalizing ""progressive"" and ""liberal"". I'm old enough to remember when liberal was such a dirty word that most Dems feared it as a label. 

On reddit, the ppl presenting as militant Bernie Bros (who might be that for real, or might be just trolls) are easily shut up with: ""You mad about how this went? Ya'll shoulda voted more on Super Tuesday. I wish you the best of luck down-ballot and in 2024, but you missed your shot in 2020"". This is a good sign for 2020 vs 2016, b/c I would have been downvoted into oblivion for making a similar statement in 2016."

11086,"What good is a protest if it never yields the desired results? An improvement is an improvement. You're saying it yourself.

Look, we need to have consistent institutional control to bring about radical change. Biden, for you, will be a bridge to more progressive policy down the road. Why? Because this is a generations long project! You and I have to accept that we will not see all the fruits of a better society within our lifetimes with the political resistance we face. It is crucial that we take every step to gain and keep power. Without power, you have nothing.

Unlike some, I believe that winning is much more important than getting a point across. Instead of complaining and wishing grave illness on one another like petty schoolchildren, let's win together."
11087,"Above all, let them talk, and just listen without trying to convince or arguing.  Let them vent. One of the most obnoxious actions of Trump &amp; co. was being ""sore winners.""

11088,"Bernie supporter who comes in peace. I‚Äôm going to vote for whoever is the DNC nominee (obviously Biden), but I truly believe that Bernie is sticking around to pull Biden more to the left, not for ego purposes. I do hope Bernie does not remain in the race for much longer if it appears Biden has moved as far left as he will go. 

At this point, whether Bernie (or Tulsi, lol) remains in the race really isn‚Äôt going to impact Biden. Neither Bernie or Trump are going to steal Biden voters. The camps of both of these men are just too far apart and the Bernie supporters who refuse to vote for Biden have already made up their minds. 

It‚Äôs silly to think that Bernie must drop out immediately to shore up the Democratic party. *His supporters aren‚Äôt voting for a person, they are voting for policies.* The distinction is paramount. Bernie can tell his supporters to back Biden all day long but it‚Äôs a much less effective when they don‚Äôt worship Bernie as an individual."
11089,This is the 4th one of these today that have asked a similar question.   Massachusetts can still vote Republican as it voted for Scott Brown to fill Ted Kennedy's seat in 2010.    I would be hesitant nominating Senators for positions.   Harris is in California and they haven't had a Republican win as senator since 1992.
11090,"I came here to see what there is to be excited about Joe Biden, and I have to tell you, this ain't it. 

You have someone explaining that they are willing to get on board but it's tough, and your response is to try and explain why Bernie is a failure. 

In 2016, Hillary chose to ignore Bernie's supporters. I know, because I was there. I voted for her, but it was a vote against Trump. I was never inspired by her, beside the fact that she would be our first female president. 

Joe - and his supporters - will need to earn progressive votes. Sorry, but the democracy we are defending allows people one way to have their voice heard. If they don't vote for you, it's your fault, not theirs."
11091,"My theory is that Warren didn't endorse Sanders because he's shown over his career that he lacks the critical ability to get things done and would likely spend 4 years in the White House yelling at people and not passing anything, leading to a Republican president getting elected after being disillusioned by broken promises from Sanders about all the stuff he said was going to be free. 

The idea that she owes support to Bernie just because he's ""progressive"" is asinine. Ability is important too. I think Warren thinks that neither Biden or Sanders, for different reasons, are not the right choice for president at this time, which is why she hasn't endorsed. As a former Warren supporter, I respect that decision."
11092,"Well it could be a viable strategy if she actually gets any delegates... Right now FiveThirtyEight has her winning barely 201 delegates. 

You can just feel the desperation in her strategy. First reverting her position on Super PAC's to keep her campaign alive and then this?

As for holding her down i think she has a small coalition of never bernie progressives and moderates who support her because she is a women. Thats why her results till now were so bad.

She is polling behind Sanders in her home state... How embarrasing is that. If she loses her home state she should just instantly drop out."
11093,"The very scientific talk about cancer treatment research really doesn't scream ""cognitive decline,"" does it?"

11095,Thank you for the heads up.
11096,"when youre making 40k or 60k, you look at a number like 100k and think ""i would be rich"". i could see a lot of those people supporting a cutoff like this. fact of the matter is most people making middle class incomes are living paycheck-to-paycheck living in a house just big enough for their family and driving modest cars. it's not like they are living lavish

in addition to paying a lot more in taxes, you typically at that income level are also putting a lot of it away into a 401k. it's not money that's available to pay for college

if state university is going to be free, it should absolutely be free for everyone. there are only a few families in america that can shrug off the cost of sending 2 or 3 kids to school, and A) they are probably going to a private school anyway, and B) it won't cost much more to cover them, too."

Polling began on Feb. 24 and continued on to Mar. 12, 2020 so Biden probably has a larger lead at this point (Super Tuesday was on Mar. 3, 2020). The Connecticut Democratic primary happens on April 28th and could be postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak."

11131,30 years of being attacked didn't help. A lot of Dems didn't vote for her because they thought she was evil because they had been told she was for so long. Biden doesn't have that problem and will pull Republicans that don't like Trump but would never vote for Hillary
11132,"There is an obviously coordinated effort amongst leftist influencers and publications like The Intercept that makes it at the very least Bernie-adjacent. I'm generally leery of Bernie and don't think he's *this* malicious, but I definitely do not put it past his staff to be part of what's going on."
11133,Too many endorsements to count
11134,"Yup I have less than $10k in student loans remaining and also an 8k auto loan. Was gonna pay off the student loans first but now I'm reconsidering. 

Probably won't matter in the end with how long it takes Congress to pass anything."
11135,"Nope, Biden will be leading. This is the only results page worth watching, because it takes into account whether the results that have come in so far are in Biden heavy areas or Sanders heavy areas:

https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/super-tuesday/"
11136,"&gt; The difference between Joe and Bernie right now is that one of them can form a coalition for their policies, and the other is Bernie.

One of the candidates is also an anti-corruption interest.  Even if Joe is a better leader, triumphalism from the majority doesn't make electability concerns go away."
11137,Democrats and Republicans want completely different kinds of change. Republicans are reactionaries that want to take away the social safety net. Why would Republican voters vote for Bernie?
11138,I'm counting on it!
11139,"Agreed, this belongs in r/enough_Sanders_spam, not here."
11140,"That's not really a fair representation of what I said. First of all, I think a public option which gives access to affordable healthcare for anyone who needs it is the best option.

Secondly, I am very much middle class and am able to do public service instead of making over twice as much in the private sector because of benefits like my healthcare. If I had to pay more in taxes it would make that a lot harder. And the people in these positions are important. Teachers are in this position. Public defenders are in this position. These are not rich assholes. Forcing them to pay more in taxes, for very little benefit, without compensation for that is going to make it impossible for some.

I'm not making six figures here. I'm doing important work for the community benefit. That's a large group of the people who are being asked to make sacrifices who are getting ignored in this debate often. It's not the rich vs. the poor only."
11141,"We are fucked, then. Trump will conquer a divided Democratic party and young ppl will stay home again. We go through 4 more years of trump, likely an economic recession with no social safety nets. Maybe then the Dems will actually put forth a progressive platform. We deserve ourselves, RIP 2020."
11142,It didn‚Äôt help that Ryan was supposed to be the GOP‚Äôs wunderkind with this brilliant policy wonk mind. And he got destroyed by Uncle Joe.
11143,"&gt;but lately it seems like every political sub has turned into a Bernie Supporter bashing fest.

I‚Äôm sorry, WHAT? Which political subs are these, politics, news, worldnews, presidentialracememes, which? Literally every subreddit that is not explicitly against Sanders is implicitly supporting him. In pics, technology, videos, gifs, adviceanimals, you name it, pro-Bernie posts are upvoted even when against the rules, and anytime I say anything mildly critical of him or mildly supportive of Biden, I get downvoted to death. 

This statement has no basis in reality, sorry. Your perception has been skewed by 95% of Reddit universally praising him for five years, and now that there‚Äôs any mild pushback (not much, as I suggested), you see a Bernie supporter bashing fest. 

Try it out, go to any default sub or almost anywhere else that is not explicitly against Sanders, and make a comment or comment reply saying that you don‚Äôt like Sanders for xyz reason. See how it goes."
11144,It's a low bar but I'll take it.
11145,You can count with my Floridian vote.
11146,Or we need to create a Secretary of Technology Advancement (or something with a better name) for him.
11147,Hands across America time people... We vote Blue in November. Pass it on.
11148,"Positive news coverage, and a fair amount of campaign funding too."
11149,Sanders should be embarrassed
11150,I think she‚Äôs the perfect candidate for him to form a very exciting ticket for the most amount of Americans.
11151,Harris Please...
11152,"That can't be stressed enough, we need a sweep.  Not just the White House but we need to take the Senate and we need it bigly.  It's gonna be a straight party ticket from me, and I would encourage anyone else listening to do the same."
11153,Beto taking Joe and Jill to Whataburger!!! Lmao!!
11154,"So basically people didn't really change their opinions before and after the debate, with it potentially having been a stalemate. 

But still, Bernie kept catching Biden lying. Biden tried to catch Bernie in a lie and when Bernie told him to read off his evidence, Biden nervously laughed and looked away because he was caught again. 

It still clearly seems like Bernie did better, but if you liked Biden before then your opinion of him wasn't going to change anyway."
11155,"I am a Bernie supporter, but not a rabid one. I would have gladly voted for Warren or Buttigieg. I wouldn't have even questioned voting for Harris. Even Bernie has some things I don't agree with.

But Biden, I don't trust. His record is right of center and I have no doubt his presidency would support large corporations over people and the environment.

I am personally sick of how out of touch the DNC is. They will continue to work with donors to prop up the candidate that they want and ignore a growing population of progressive voters. Most of us only want to see some sign that progressive ideas have a place. The DNC and Biden have not given us that.

At the end of the day, I will most likely vote Biden. But a Biden nominee will assuredly lose the election. And Democrats will continue to lose until they make room for progressive ideas. This is no longer politics as usual, the courts are stacked, the balance of power has been damaged. The only way to win is with rabid supporters, it is the only way to take away the gerrymandered districts short of a constitutional convention."
11156,"They will have Hillary to debate Bernie for funsies.

11157,"I‚Äôd suggest being pragmatic, there are only two candidates with a path to the nomination, voting for anyone except the two (maybe except for warren in Massachusetts) is a wasted vote."
11158,"Yes, Biden is about Unity and Empathy, don't attack other people."
11159,"Well, I just want to make sure you‚Äôre aware, most hunting rifles are semi auto. All that means is one trigger pull equals one shot. 

I‚Äôm not convinced that any of the ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù features really make it easier to kill people. What features exactly do you think do the job? The only one that moves the needle for me is the detachable magazine. How does a barrel shroud or adjustable stock make it easier?

I don‚Äôt see how we can actually reasonably regulate this, short of banning all semi auto rifles and pistols. 

That will never happen, and even if it did we‚Äôd never get them off the street. 

I will still support and vote for any gun control measure,  but I think we‚Äôre focusing on the wrong thing. Registration, proficiency testing, licensing fees, etc all seem like the right thing to me, as well as making red flag laws way more robust and efficient. There‚Äôs so many cases of people being crazy and others reporting them to the police but the red flag process not working."
11160,"No. Send your downvote if you must but the kerning stands. It‚Äôs provocative. Like Diamond Joe. You gotta know what you‚Äôre willing to lose on. For me, it‚Äôs kerning, Jack. *Makes ice cream cone*"
11161,"I know a better trick, being one of the first people to talk about marriage equality on national television, a vital part of administration under which marriage equality was established and by which crucial steps towards protection of LGBTQ+ citizens were successfully taken in spite of GOP obstruction, ending up doing far more good for the community than people going around pointing at voting records from over 2 decades."
11162,"'I cannot condone moderate positions'

Fine, but this attitude is one of the reasons that Sanders couldn't appeal to the backbone of the Democratic party. 'Moderates'	are just people, they have their values and their morals, you're not better than us, or superior to anyone for holding the views you hold. This post comes across as incredibly snarky and offensive.

I mean no offence by this, I just hope you can see the point I'm making. We're a diverse nation and shitting on 'moderates'/'centrists'/those who may lean conservative is not the way to go. 

Also funny that Biden is a 'moderate' when he plans to raise the minimum wage, make healthcare much more affordable (by placing a cap on the maximum you pay) and free for those below a poverty threshold. Record investments in renewable energy, incentivise farmers to produce fewer emissions (as in pay them for greener practices), free community college...

That's not moderate."
11163,We just gotta beat Trump and work on the rest later.
11164,YES!!
11165,"yeah about that. We will be if bernie gets snubbed again. what democrats don't realize is there are very few of you left. there ARE two wings of the democratic party, and a good oh... so far looks like 45% of it is sick of your shit. Good luck beating anyone with half a party left. We'll be over here waiting for the boomers to die off while we build a new party."
11166,I'm surprised she didn't already endorse him quite frankly...
11167,"Nope, completely different virus type."
11168,"Well, on the other hand, re run it again after the impending recession and flub of COVID 19. If Joe‚Äôs team is smart they‚Äôll run on a platform that he helped Obama get out of the Great Recession."
11169,"Total bullshit. She was a woman and was discriminated against because it. Similar fate for Elizabeth Warren and the female candidates this go around. She lost a good five points last cycle simply because of people resistant to voting for a woman as commander-in-chief and head of the military.

Source: I was a Hillary organizer and cannot tell you how many people I talk to who were resistant to her, would say ‚ÄúI want a woman but not that woman,‚Äú just as they‚Äôve done this time with other female candidates, and almost certainly would‚Äôve voted for Joe."
11170,"Hopefully this is just enough to tip Washington.

A loss in every primary might be enough to end Bernie's scorched earth campaign."
11171,still won't get us to vote for him.
11172,Roller coaster. :D
11173,"He probably forgot that he opposed it,  what with his degrading mental state and all."
11174,Washington probably won‚Äôt be called tomorrow night because there will be a lot of ballots still in the mail.
11175,"I hear ya...  I'm in the environmental regulatory compliance field, and know EXACTLY how / why regs are put in place.  Going to the r/environment sub can be so very frustrating.  You see people posting and mass-upvoting articles based on flawed data or blatant scaremongering all the time.  It is nigh-impossible to get a word in edgewise.  Every once in a while, I engage anyways because I'm a bit of a masochist, but its just so frustrating to feel like you're shouting into a hurricane...."
11176,"Oh yeah, for sure. Still nice though:)"
11177,Bernie finna whoop that ass on Tuesday.
11178,It's literally the same stuff they were saying in 2016
11179,"Oh, Biden was the first administration official.  People thought he might get dumped from the administration for it.  Instead, he convinced Obama and the administration that this was the only correct course.

This is what moral leadership is."
11180,"LOL, well, don't worry. Bernie is being surrounded by his cult on r/politics and many other socialist subs."
11181,Cant complain with those as I do like nuclear.

While Bernie's numbers stayed pretty consistent; **96,498 in 2016 and 105,070 in 2020.**"
11183,"Perception is everything in politics and throughout the entire primary, Biden has been defined as ""moderate"" (especially in a crowded field with many candidates running to the left of him) and with 100% name ID, his name is immediately related to Barack Obama. Biden is a mainstream center-left democrat and a couple of progressive policies (from an already quite progressive platform) will not re-define who Biden is in the eyes of the public, as much as the GOP will try to scream socialism. 

Hillary was seen as very liberal since her days as first lady while trying to implement Clintoncare AND in 2016 you didn't know how Trump would govern and you have to take that into consideration when people who loathed Hillary voted for him."
11184,MI time.to.wipenout sanders
11185,"I'm not completely sure why Bernie supporters are hoping this in the Biden channel. I guess you guys think Bernie's gonna have a breakout moment or some such.

Regardless it's not gonna matter. 

The only way Bernie makes up any ground is to moderate his tone and message. I don't see Bernie doing that. I see him doubling down on his message and therefore making sure he fails completely.

Please don't come to this channel to hype Bernie. We don't got to your channels and torment you guys."
11186,Didn't he repeal DADT w/ Obama?  He also pushed Obama on the issue.
11187,He showed his true colours by fighting for what he believes in and not simply giving up? Sure.
11188,"Just tell them ""no do-overs."" They were salivating at the last 1:1 debate, then he lost, and they whine Joe said Bernie had 9 superpacs...instead of a mix of 9 superpacs, regular pacs and other dark money groups. Tough pill to swallow against a guy who was supposedly on the verge of death and unable to string sentences together."
11189,Wow is this republican mayor apart of the cOrRupT DNC???
11190,"Dont worry, twitter isnt real life"
11191,"If that's the case, then Ohio should have carried on!"
11192,"That‚Äôs fair, I can definitely understand your frustration. Biden wasn‚Äôt my first choice either, so I get where you are coming from."
11193,Did this post get linked to by a pro Bernie Discord or something?  There's like 10x the comments all from Sanders supporters trying to concern troll.
11194,"It‚Äôs bad enough Trump has his cult, the other issue is that he‚Äôs an incumbent. This will be tough uphill battle."
11195,Good showing by Biden. Strong finish too. There is a reason Trump is scared of him.
11196,"That was a caucus. This is a primary.

Plus Hillary won the non-binding primary that came the following week"
11197,"Yes. Look up ‚ÄúBiden with Buttigieg‚Äù first four pictures of them together have Joe with a hand on Pete‚Äôs back, shoulder or speaking into his ear. If you look back at a lot of Obama era press conference he hugs Obama a lot too."
11198,I really really really hope you're right!
11199,And I am once again asking for your financial support.
11200,r/PresidentialRaceMemes has become a cesspool of anti Biden and anti Democratic party memes. We need to start posting there and show our side of things.
11201,It's like the Biden campaign is a melting pot of all the supporters from across the other 200 candidates that were running this year.  A perfect symbol of America.
11202,And we can also sit at the cool kids' table with Punk Rock Hero Beto!
11203,"People don‚Äôt realize everyone acts differently in social situations.

Joe just seems like a goofy guy and sometimes kinda awkward which isn‚Äôt a big deal at all.

I guarantee you that all candidates are under stress and when some people stress they may act forgetful or slur their words."
11204,"Yup. If Bernie were the frontrunner, she would probably endorse her, but since the map is different I'm wondering if she's now thinking whether it would be better to use her leverage to influence the Biden platform. I don't think it will translate into an endorsement any time soon though, I think she'll wait on the sidelines as of now.

Remember other candidates like Booker or Harris have not made an endorsement either yet."
11205,"Goddamnit Duckworth said no? 

Ok plan b.

11210,Joe is precious cargo!!!
11211,"I think he should do it today. The post-Super Tuesday states are already heavily Biden favored, and any bump he gets from Pete would be more effective now."
11212,"I was willing to give Bernie a shot. I think he did Hillary dirty in 2016 but that's just my opinion. 

Rachel Maddow interviewed Bernie and basically called him to task about the vitriol his supporters have given to her and it was his one chance. He could have said something about not being able to control his supporters and that he doesn't support that type of behavior BUT NOPE. 

His response was ""If you don't think that comes into MY campaign....""

Some Warren supporters will join his campaign but ones like myself will not."
11213,Or can he ?
11214,"JOE is that blue wall. He‚Äôs the one to appeal to the PA coal miner. The Michigan autoworker. The Wisconsin and Iowa farmer etc etc etc. 

I‚Äôd personally take Amy over Kamala any day. But above all I want Warren to ease the tension with the Bernie base and can be a bridge to moderates and progressives."

11216,That was his excuse for one of the no votes. He didn't provide excuses for the half a dozen other times he did it.
11217,The issue is that those never Trumpers will just vote third party. You have to respect them though: they vote.
11218,"I don't think so the article never gave any evidence as to why it would be Kamala Harris. I think Biden needs to reach out to Latinos or he needs someone with less baggage. Masto, Lujan Grisham, or someone with a great bio like Duckworth seem more likely."
11219,"Mmm, yes, a loyal democrat, just what the overlords want.

In 2020, I wonder if I need to point out the sarcasm. ._."
11220,Bernie sucks
11221,"I feel like had Bernie not basically called Warren a liar on national television, a Bernie endorsement would've been a slamdunk by now.

Warren and Biden seems to have been rivals on policy since the start of their careers, so I'd imagine Bernie is ideologically closer, but culturally very dissimilar."

&gt;That said, other polls, including some very high-quality ones, still found Trump underwater on the issue. For example, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from March 11-13 found that 45 percent of registered voters approved of Trump‚Äôs handling of the coronavirus, while 51 percent disapproved. And the aforementioned NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey gave Trump a 44 percent approval rating on the coronavirus and a 49 percent disapproval rating (among all adults).

At least that‚Äôs how I am reading it"

11252,"I completely agree with you on Clyburn....I was just pointing out that the particular article/leak was debunked by Biden folks.

I would bet money it will be a Black woman, because Clyburn's outright said it, and Joe's more or less said it, too. Klobuchar will be AG or SOS, even though her name is being floated around for VP imo. I like Harris, but I get what you mean. Also, she unfortunately has a lot of baggage...many politicians do....but her baggage has been brought up/combed through more than others and the more left leaning media really dislikes her. That said, I'll be surprised if it isn't her. 

It's why I sort of lean more towards Terri Sewell (Alabama) or Gwen Moore (Wisconsin) who have a lot of experience and are not from blue states. Demings lacks the experience, but the whole first female police chief of Orlando could help in the general (would have sunk her in a primary).....and her name keeps coming up again and again which seems interesting.... Add in that she's used to the national press, did well in the Impeachment, and is well liked in her district...and that FL will probably be razor thin.....I wouldn't be shocked if she was picked."
11253,"Staff will also be paid for as employees of the SuperPac so no grey areas.

11254,"Full disclosure, I identify as center-right. I voted for Kasich in the 2016 primaries and Johnson/Weld in the General because I was living in a heavily blue state that Clinton won by &gt;20 points. 

I like Bill Weld but saw no reason to vote for him this year. Since the state I currently live in lets you choose the primary you vote in, I figured my vote would be better used to vote for Biden. I voted for him and he won the state I live in now. 

I will be voting for Joe in November."
11255,"Ehh no. But I agree they don‚Äôt want a pushover. I wish he would refrain from saying stuff like this, but I‚Äôm not against it, because there‚Äôs so many false conspiracies trying to tear down his campaign. It‚Äôs sad to see the bots have made it to the sub now that he‚Äôs the nominee."
11256,"[Luria's campaign staff were one of a few reasons I stayed in politics after a humiliating and incredibly stressful campaign gig early in 2018. As someone on the fence between Joe and Liz after losing Pete, this message and her Biden endorsement mean a lot to me re. whom to vote for.](https://twitter.com/ElaineLuriaVA/status/1234541857058607104)"
11257,"My fear is that clamping down on assault rifles too quickly could create lots of unintended consequences. We have millions of these guns in private hands. Just limiting the sale of new guns would make the price of existing guns shoot way up.

If then in addition, you limit person to person sales of these guns, you have now a huge very profitable black market, a huge boost for organized crime. 

Future restrictions need to be done in a smart way that takes the reality of the situation into account.

Plus, with the Coronavirus causing panic, the idea of limiting gun sales will be very unpopular. I plan on growing a massive garden, and have thousands of dollars of prepared supplies, the only thing I don‚Äôt have and that I am now considering is a gun."
11258,"You think this country isn't ready for a woman president? My sister said this (citing Warren this year - people in our circle constantly called her ""crazy"" and she hated it) but I disagree. I think Michelle Obama would beat any of the current Dem candidates, though I know she'd never run."
11259,How about we focus on attacking policy and record rather than giving in to sleezy ad hominems.
11260,Yes
11261,"Huh, I know you. You go on HaloStory too."
11262,This election is Captain America vs King Twit.
11263,"I read that as ""Epstein"" LMAO"
11264,I wish you the best.
11265,[Joe has asked him to hold off.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/04/25/barack-obama-praises-joe-biden-but-doesnt-offer-2020-endorsement/3571729002/)
11266,"&gt;	I think Warren‚Äôs in more significant in terms of what her endorsement could mean and how it could really help to end this race.

Won‚Äôt matter. Bernie‚Äôs folks declared Warren dead to them the second she didn‚Äôt immediately drop out and endorse him after a few bad showings. I firmly believe there is room for **everyone** under the tent of what Biden could make the Democratic Party for the next generation. Unpopular opinion though: exerting any serious effort to cater to the progressives who call Joe ‚Äúsenile‚Äù or accuse Elizabeth Warren of being a super PAC shill‚Äî[especially when Bernie has taken plenty of corporate money](https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/candidate?id=N00000528)‚Äîis a lost cause simply because all of the objective facts in the world won‚Äôt change their mind/position."
11267,At least he remembered to win super Tuesday.
11268,"I‚Äôm a Bernie/Warren supporter who is really happy about this move. I think it will make a huge difference for a lot of people. Also, I was ready to support Joe 100% when it became clear that he would be the nominee. But I was really hoping he would adopt some of the Bernie or Warren student loan plans."
11269,She was not on the ballot
11270,"I can be proud of my state for politics for once, yay!!"
11271,yup and having a star senate candidate like Mark Kelly in AZ helps a lot.

11273,"Yeah, that‚Äôs a good point"
11274,It‚Äôs because they only included 500 simulations with Bloomberg winning American Samoa. If you take that off its more workable.
11275,"*I was that little girl*

Nevermind. One power please!"
11276,"How much of a loan did you accrue and what was the interest percentage on your debt?  Also, aren‚Äôt  there opportunities already existing in your profession to get a lot of help with loan repayment if you worked either with the Bureau of Indian Affairs or worked in economically depressed areas?  Just curious.  Also, both my parents were educators and I have a bunch of friends/acquaintances who are teachers and know they have debts, but haven‚Äôt heard of any that aren‚Äôt successfully paying off their loans.  What am I missing?  Maybe you need to put off having kids until you are economically able to support them?  I did.  Most highly educated professionals are delaying having family‚Äôs.  I always thought financial concerns was a part of this decision.  That‚Äôs why South Korea has one of the lowest rates of birth in the world.  It‚Äôs because of the extremely high cost of education.  Education costs a lot of money.  No one forces us to get further education.  There are going to be certain compromises on your lifestyle and and life choices due to your choice of being highly educated.  This has always been the way of academia.  Why must it change now?  After graduating I always rented, out of having kids and lived the live of a student until only recently when I was close to paying off my loans.  I did staycations before there was a name for it and lived more humbly than many of my employees.  This is the price of higher education."
11277,"2008 was a close race, so I can understand the passion.  But 2016 was a landslide for Clinton. This year, it‚Äôs an even bigger blowout between Biden and Sanders. 

There‚Äôs just no reason for ugliness.  It‚Äôs not going to help Sanders and only increases Trump‚Äôs chances in November."

11279,My goodness what a beautiful couple.
11280,How about he just suspend his entire campaign?
11281,"idk about the apps, but if you can access it on the pc, click the 'edit' button at the top right corner of the 'subreddit info' to make the change."
11282,Biden is probably favored pretty well in Oregon at this point.
11283,Nice video! And thanks for the nod to Hillary Clinton as a pioneer on health care for all already decades ago. Under appreciated fact.
11284,"Go Joe, TAKE TRUMP DOWN!"
